    "    KEY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. VIOLATION SEVERITY\n",
    "    - Calculate total fines from the evidence (don't hardcode)\n",
    "    - Identify the scale of violations (amounts involved vs fines paid)\n",
    "    - Determine if violations were systemic or isolated\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. CURRENT RISK STATUS\n",
    "    - Count active investigations (ongoing = unresolved risk)\n",
    "    - Identify investigating authorities \n",
    "    - Assess geographic spread (multiple jurisdictions = higher risk)\n",
    "    - Evaluate timeline and provide quote with date in ISO 8601 format (recent violations = weak current controls)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n",
    "    - Evaluate settlement efforts (genuine improvement vs PR)\n",
    "    - Check for leadership accountability (executives resigned?)\n",
    "    - Assess system improvements (new AML systems, training?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. PATTERN RECOGNITION\n",
    "    - Multiple fines for similar issues = poor compliance culture\n",
    "    - Repeated violations across years = systemic failure\n",
    "    - Mix of old violations + strong settlement = possible reform\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\\n\\nLukoil is currently subject to severe, ongoing sanctions and enforcement actions by the UK, U.S., and EU, with no evidence of fines paid or settlement efforts. The most serious issue is the imposition of full asset freezes and active criminal investigations into sanctions violations, including the attempted seizure of a $45 million aircraft. All major actions are recent (2022–2025), indicating unresolved and escalating risk. There is no evidence of remediation, leadership accountability, or system improvements. The total confirmed fines paid to date are €0, but the scale and breadth of sanctions represent a critical risk. \\n\\n**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\\n\\n- **Sanctions Violations (2022–2025):**  \\n  - On October 15, 2025, the UK imposed full asset freezing sanctions on Lukoil and its subsidiaries, marking the first such action by the UK, U.S., or EU.  \\n  - On October 22–23, 2023, the U.S. Treasury and EU imposed sanctions on Lukoil and its trading unit, requiring cessation of all transactions and asset freezes.  \\n  - On September 1, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a warrant to seize a $45 million aircraft owned by Lukoil, citing ongoing investigations into sanctions violations.  \\n- **Nature:** These are not isolated incidents but coordinated, multi-jurisdictional actions targeting the core business and assets of Lukoil.\\n\\n**3. CURRENT STATUS**\\n\\n- **Active Investigations:**  \\n  - At least three ongoing enforcement actions/investigations (UK, U.S., EU) as of 2025-10-15.  \\n  - No cases have been dismissed or settled; no fines have been paid.\\n- **Investigating Authorities:**  \\n  - UK government (sanctions authority)  \\n  - U.S. Treasury and U.S. District Court (criminal/civil enforcement)  \\n  - EU sanctions authorities\\n- **Geographic Spread:**  \\n  - UK, U.S., EU, and Middle East (via Litasco Middle East DMCC)\\n- **Settlement Efforts:**  \\n  - None reported; no evidence of leadership change, system improvements, or public remediation.\\n\\n**4. TRAJECTORY**\\n\\n- **Trend:**  \\n  - Risk is increasing, with the most severe actions (full asset freezes) occurring most recently (2025-10-15).  \\n  - No indication of improvement or reform; all actions are unresolved and escalating.\\n- **Quote:**  \\n  - “On October 15, 2025, the UK designated Lukoil as an asset freeze target under its expanded Russia-related sanctions regime…” (2025-10-15)\\n\\n**5. RISK RATING**\\n\\n- **HIGH**  \\n  - Justification: Multiple, ongoing criminal and civil investigations; full asset freezes in major jurisdictions; no evidence of remediation or settlement; risk is escalating and unresolved.\\n\\n**6. PARTNERSHIP RECOMMENDATION**\\n\\n- **AVOID PARTNERSHIP**  \\n  - Rationale: Lukoil is subject to active, unresolved criminal and civil sanctions investigations in the UK, U.S., and EU, with no evidence of settlement, remediation, or improvement. The risk is systemic, multi-jurisdictional, and increasing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary Table**\\n\\n| Criteria                | Status/Details                                                                 |\\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Total Fines Paid        | €0                                                                            |\\n| Most Serious Issue      | Full asset freezes and ongoing criminal/civil sanctions investigations        |\\n| Ongoing Risk?           | Yes (as of 2025-10-15)                                                        |\\n| Investigating Authority | UK government, U.S. Treasury, U.S. District Court, EU sanctions authorities   |\\n| Geographic Spread       | UK, U.S., EU, Middle East                                                     |\\n| Settlement Efforts      | None reported                                                                 |\\n| Risk Rating             | HIGH                                                                          |\\n| Recommendation          | AVOID PARTNERSHIP                                                             |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 828, 'prompt_tokens': 1019, 'total_tokens': 1847, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d38c7f4fa7', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CZhuXCwVjUplLWZ8WVFeQ2ry5LzNN', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--0054bac4-80c5-4a1a-a71e-b2a82a39f08a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1019, 'output_tokens': 828, 'total_tokens': 1847, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})],\n",

Alertă: Rusia poate ataca NATO # După gratii, după ce și-a luat telefoane de ultimă generație: Cum ar fi obținut banii un bărbat din Bălți ###### 23 octombrie 2025, ora 04:51 **Un tnăr din Bălți a fost condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare după ce s-ar fi dat drept angajat al unei bănci și a lăsat o femeie fără peste 85.000 de lei. Ulterior, din banii obținuți ilegal și-a cumpărat telefoane de ultimă generație.** Potrivit unui comunicat emis de Procuratura Generală, tnărul ar fi acționat sub îndrumarea unui membru al unui grup infracțional organizat, cu care ar fi comunicat prin rețeaua „Telegram”. Gruparea, alcătuită din persoane încă neidentificate, ar fi fost formată în scopul comiterii mai multor escrocherii și funcționa după o schemă bine pusă la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol precis în înșelarea victimelor și obținerea ilegală a banilor. Astfel, pe 25 aprilie 2025, membrii grupului infracțional ar fi apelat o femeie din Chișinău, pretinznd că sunt reprezentanți ai unei bănci. Sub motivul că pe contul ei s-ar fi detectat tentative de tranzacții neautorizate, aceștia ar fi convins-o să le ofere parola de acces la cardul bancar. Ulterior, la instrucțiunile grupului, inculpatul s-ar fi deplasat la un bancomat din Bălți, unde a extras suma de 8.000 de lei din contul victimei. În aceeași zi, folosind datele bancare obținute ilegal, acesta a efectuat achiziții frauduloase într-un magazin de electronice, cumpărnd trei telefoane mobile de ultimă generație, în valoare totală de 79.296 de lei.

Об этом [сообщается на сайте](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0225) американского Минфина. Ведомство называет Grinex наследницей закрывшейся российской криптобиржи Garantex, которая, по его данным, «напрямую содействовала» киберпреступникам и обработала с 2019 года трансакции, связанные с незаконной деятельностью, на более чем $100 миллионов. Минфин США внес Garantex в санкционный список в апреле 2022 года. Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex, как утверждает ведомство, для уклонения от ограничительных мер. Garantex, основанная в 2019 году в Эстонии и ведущая деятельность в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, по данным Минфина США, обслуживала даркнет-рынки и группы операторов программ-вымогателей, включая Conti, LockBit и Ryuk. В феврале 2022 года компания Garantex лишилась эстонской лицензии на предоставление услуг в сфере цифровых активов после того, как подразделение финансовой разведки Эстонии выявило критические нарушения в системе противодействия отмыванию денег и финансированию терроризма (AML/CFT) и обнаружило связи между Garantex и кошельками, используемыми для преступной деятельности. В марте 2025 года американские и европейские правоохранители заблокировали домен Garantex и заморозили $26 миллионов, после чего клиенты и активы были переведены на новую площадку — Grinex. В пресс-релизе Минфина США подчеркивается, что Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex специально «для обхода санкций». Кроме того, под санкции Минфина США попали трое руководителей Garantex — ее сооснователь Сергей Менделеев, коммерческий директор Александр Мира Серда и региональный директор Павел Каравацкий — и шесть компаний из России и Кыргызстана, которые, как заявило ведомство, «поддерживали участие биржи во вредоносной кибердеятельности». Это кыргызстанская Old Vector, а также российские A7, A71 и A7 Agent, участвовавшие в выпуске рублевого стейблкоина A7A5. Его, по версии Управления по контролю за иностранными активами Министерства финансов США, Garantex использовала для перевода средств клиентам и обхода ограничений. Кроме того, под американские санкции попали проекты InDeFi Bank и Exved.

Se întâmplă după ce oamenii legii au descins cu mai multe percheziții în cadrul unui dosar penal. Potrivit surselor noastre, Chitorog ar fi omul de legătură între gruparea din Rusia și cele din Republica Moldova care introduc bani pentru influențarea alegerilor parlamentare din 28 septembrie. În fața magistraților a apărut și un alt membru al organizației criminale. Cei doi au fost plasați în arest preventiv pentru 30 de zile. Suspecții riscă pedepse cuprinse între opt și 15 ani de închisoare. Ședința de astăzi a durat aproximativ o oră și s-a desfășurat cu ușile închise. Echipa noastră a solicitat explicații privind interdicția de acces pentru presă și restricțiile impuse jurnaliștilor. Angajatul responsabil de securitate a declarat că nu face decât să execute indicațiile primite. Potrivit procurorului de caz, învinuiții sunt certați pentru organizarea și conducerea unei organizații criminale. GHEORGHE SOLOMON, procurorul de caz: _\"- Sunt persoane învinuite de săvârșirea infracțiunii prevăzute de articolul 284, aliniatul 1 în complicitate._ _- Ce prevede acest articol?_ _- Organizarea, conducerea unei organizații criminale. În privința persoanelor a fost aplicat arest preventiv pe un termen de 30 de zile. Au fost examinate materialele care au fost anexate la demersuri. La moment sunt întreprinse măsuri de investigație._ _- Cealaltă persoană de ce nu a fost adusă în fața judecătorilor?_ _- Este un drept procesual al învinuitului. Nu a dorit să se prezinte. Avocatul a semnat acest refuz. Judecătorul a admis această cerere. Persoanele menționate se bucură de prezumția nevinovăției până la emiterea unei sentințe definitive în privința acestora.\"_ Ofițerii Direcției combaterea criminalității organizate a Inspectoratului Național de Investigații, în comun cu Procuratura Hâncești – oficiul Leova, au desfășurat, pe 2 și 3 septembrie, nouă percheziții la domiciliile și în automobilele unor persoane vizate într-un dosar penal privind crearea și conducerea unei organizații criminale. Poliția precizează că în cadrul anchetei au fost recunoscute drept învinuiți doi bărbați apropiați autorității criminale„Kitaeț”. Unul dintre ei, cunoscut sub pseudonimul „Vova Davai”, era considerat „supraveghetor” al activităților ilegale ale grupărilor afiliate și avea rolul de a gestiona „visteria criminală” – un fond în care se acumulau lunar cel puțin 100.000 de dolari din activități ilegale. Oamenii legii au ridicat trei automobile de lux, sume de bani, telefoane, muniții și alte bunuri, valoarea totală a acestora depășind două milioane de lei. Potrivit surselor Jurnal TV, „Vova Davai” ar fi omul de legătură între gruparea din Rusia și cele din Republica Moldova care introduc bani pentru influențarea alegerilor parlamentare din 28 septembrie. ###### Opinia ta contează.

On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Dans le même temps, l’armée russe a affirmé avoir conquis deux autres villages, Sadové dans la région de Kharkiv (nord-est) et Krasnoguirské dans celle de Zaporijjia (sud), où les forces ukrainiennes, en infériorité numérique, perdent progressivement du terrain. Les troupes russes, qui s’efforcent depuis près de quatre ans d’envahir ce pays, prennent actuellement pour cible, à l’approche de l’hiver, un réseau énergétique déjà fragile. Dans un message en ligne, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a déclaré que les Russes avaient visé des civils et des installations énergétiques dans dix régions, dont celle de la capitale Kiev, au cours de leur nouvelle attaque aérienne massive dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. «Nous comptons sur l’Amérique, l’Europe et les pays du G7 pour ne pas ignorer la volonté de Moscou de tout détruire», a-t-il insisté, appelant à de nouvelles sanctions pour contraindre la Russie à mettre fin à la guerre. L’armée de l’air ukrainienne a de son côté dit avoir abattu 623 des 653 drones et 52 missiles ennemis qu’elle a recensés dans l’espace aérien de l’Ukraine au cours de la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. Les journalistes de l’AFP ont pour leur part entendu des drones russes survoler Kiev. «Un «coup dur» DTEK, la plus grande entreprise énergétique privée d’Ukraine, a signalé que des centrales électriques avaient été endommagées dans plusieurs régions, sans préciser lesquelles. Son PDG, Maxim Timtchenko, a dénoncé un «coup dur porté à nos efforts pour assurer la continuité de l’approvisionnement en électricité cet hiver». La compagnie nationale d\\'électricité Ukrenergo a concédé que ce nouveau raid avait - à nouveau - placé son réseau dans une situation difficile et que des coupures de courant persisteraient dans l’ensemble de l’Ukraine jusqu\\'à jeudi soir. Des coupures d\\'électricité «continues» pourraient en outre être imposées dans toutes les régions dès vendredi, a-t-elle ajouté. Dans la région occidentale de Lviv, frontalière de la Pologne, le gouverneur a reconnu que deux installations énergétiques aient été touchées. Le ministère russe de la Défense a de son côté expliqué avoir lancé une vaste opération à l’aide de missiles et de drones contre des sites militaro-industriels, des installations énergétiques et des bases aériennes ukrainiennes. L’armée russe attaque chaque hiver depuis 2022 les infrastructures électriques de l’Ukraine, la contraignant à des restrictions dans l’alimentation en électricité et à importer de l\\'énergie. Un lourd bilan humain Dans la ville de Zaporijjia (sud-est), deux personnes ont été tuées et 23 blessées, dont six enfants, selon le chef de la région militaire. Un journaliste de l’AFP a vu un immeuble d’habitation ravagé et des secouristes déblayer les décombres. L’administration régionale de Vinnytsia (centre-ouest) a fait état de cinq blessés, dont une fillette de sept ans qui est par la suite morte à l’hôpital. Le ministère russe de la Défense a quant à lui déclaré que 170 drones ukrainiens avaient été abattus pendant la nuit, dont 48 dans la région de Briansk, à la frontière avec l’Ukraine, et neuf dans celle de Moscou. L’armée russe bombarde presque quotidiennement les zones d’habitation et les infrastructures civiles en Ukraine depuis le début de l’invasion en février 2022. Les Ukrainiens ripostent par des frappes de longue portée, le plus souvent avec des drones. Ces derniers mois, ils ciblent surtout les infrastructures énergétiques russes avec l’objectif de perturber les exportations de pétrole et de réduire le financement de l’effort de guerre de la Russie.

Zigaretten auf dem Schwarzmarkt. Illegale Zigaretten kosteten den Staat im letzten Jahr allein 401 Millionen Euro. Ab 1. September starten der BDZ und Philip Morris Deutschland deshalb eine gemeinsame Aufklärungskampagne. von Sprit+ --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [Folgen auf:](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJqxqAwwgI_tAg?hl=de&gl=DE&ceid=DE:de) --- * [#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\") * [#Tabakkonsum](/tag/tabakkonsum-3368052 \"Tabakkonsum\") * [#Tabaksteuer](/tag/tabaksteuer-3692852 \"Tabaksteuer\") Nur 38 Prozent der Befragten lehnen den Kauf illegaler Waren – etwa geschmuggelter Zigaretten – konsequent ab. Gleichzeitig zeigt fast die Hälfte (48 Prozent) zumindest Verständnis für solche Käufe. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer repräsentativen Online-[Umfrage](/tag/umfrage-1712250 \"Mehr zum Thema Umfrage\") des Meinungsforschungsinstituts Bonsai Public im Auftrag von [Philip Morris](/tag/philip-morris-2020390 \"Mehr zum Thema Philip Morris\") Deutschland*1*. Kriminelle Strukturen scheinen bereits tief in der Gesellschaft verankert zu sein und zunehmend akzeptiert oder in Kauf genommen zu werden. Angesichts wachsender Steuerverluste, eines florierenden Schwarzmarkts und der Stärkung krimineller Netzwerke, die mit Menschenhandel, Drogen- und Waffenkriminalität verbunden sind, hält Philip Morris dies für ein besorgniserregendes Signal. Die Bedrohung durch die Organisierte Kriminalität wird von acht von zehn Befragten als hoch oder sehr hoch eingeschätzt – und das nicht ohne Grund: 59 Prozent erleben sie bereits als Teil ihres Alltags und ist davon überzeugt, dass sie auch in der eigenen Region stattfindet. Deutschland als Produktionsort für illegale Zigaretten – dem Haupttreiber und eine zentrale Finanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität – können sich immerhin über 40 Prozent vorstellen. Damit ist das Thema für viele keine abstrakte Bedrohung in fernen Ländern mehr. Fast die Hälfte der Befragten fordert daher, dass die Politik dem Kampf gegen Organisierte Kriminalität deutlich mehr Priorität einräumen muss. Gleichzeitig zeigt die Umfrage erhebliche Wissenslücken: Die Rolle illegaler Zigaretten als eine Hauptfinanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität wird stark unterschätzt. ## Die Kampagne Genau hier will die neue bundesweite Aufklärungskampagne von Philip Morris Deutschland und der BDZ Deutsche Zoll- und Finanzgewerkschaft ansetzen. Ziel ist es, auf den illegalen Handel und dessen Verbindungen zur Organisierten Kriminalität aufmerksam zu machen. Die Kernbotschaft lautet: \"Der Handel mit illegalen Tabakwaren ist kein Kavaliersdelikt – er gefährdet die öffentliche [Sicherheit](/tag/sicherheit-1366953 \"Mehr zum Thema Sicherheit\"), verursacht erhebliche wirtschaftliche Schäden und stärkt kriminelle Netzwerke.\" Geplant sind Informationsmaßnahmen im öffentlichen Raum. Auch das Bild eines stetigen Stroms illegaler [Produkte](/tag/produkte-1654301 \"Mehr zum Thema Produkte\") wird aufgegriffen: Insgesamt werden 17 [Lkw](/tag/lkw-1359261 \"Mehr zum Thema Lkw\") mit bedruckten Heckflächen unterwegs sein, um Aufmerksamkeit auf das Thema zu lenken. Im Jahr 2024 wurden hierzulande schätzungsweise 1,7 Milliarden illegale Zigaretten konsumiert – ein Lkw steht damit symbolisch für 100 Millionen illegal konsumierte Zigaretten. ## Wirtschaft und Sicherheit werden untergraben Allein in Deutschland entgingen dem Staat im vergangenen Jahr rund 401 Millionen Euro an Steuereinnahmen allein durch den Konsum illegal hergestellter Zigaretten (Quelle: KPMG Report 2024). Gewinne aus dem illegalen Handel fließen häufig in andere kriminelle Aktivitäten. Damit untergräbt der illegale Zigarettenmarkt nicht nur wirtschaftliche Strukturen, sondern auch die öffentliche Sicherheit. \"Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage sprechen eine deutliche Sprache: Eine alarmierende Akzeptanz illegaler Produkte untergräbt unsere Gesellschaft und stärkt die Organisierte Kriminalität. Besonders der Handel mit illegalen Zigaretten spielt dabei eine große Rolle – er finanziert kriminelle Strukturen. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Organisierte Kriminalität keine Randerscheinung ist, sondern eine präsente Bedrohung für die öffentliche Sicherheit“, so Tammo Körner, Senior Manager Fiscal Affairs & ITP bei Philip Morris Deutschland. Nach Ansicht von Phlip Morris ist ein entschlossenes Vorgehen auf mehreren Ebenen notwendig: * Die Kriminalitätsbekämpfung muss gestärkt werden. * Eine verbesserte internationale Zusammenarbeit gegen die meist grenzüberschreitend operierenden Netzwerke. * Eine umfassenden Aufklärungsarbeit, um Bürgern für die Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Kauf illegaler Zigaretten und der Finanzierung krimineller Aktivitäten zu sensibilisieren. Thomas Liebel, Bundesvorsitzender der BDZ, ergänzt: \"Der Zoll ist der Schutzwall, der Staatseinnahmen sichert, die Wirtschaft vor kriminellen Einflüssen bewahrt und die Sicherheit der Bevölkerung gewährleistet. Doch trotz wachsender Aufgaben, etwa angesichts der Zunahme illegaler Produktionsstätten für Zigaretten und immer professioneller organisierter Geldwäsche, wird die Modernisierung des Zolls durch anhaltende Sparmaßnahmen gebremst – und das kommt die Allgemeinheit teuer zu stehen.\" *1Online-Umfrage im August 2025 unter 1.000 Personen in Deutschland im Alter von 18 bis 69 Jahren.* --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [ZUR STARTSEITE](/ \"Zur Startseite\") --- ### HASHTAG --- ## *[#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\")* 22.08.2025 [#Intertabac](/tag/intertabac-1986923 \"Intertabac\") ## [Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025](/nachrichten/tabak-und-tabakersatz/nicht-verpassen-landewyck-auf-der-intertabac-2025-3701358 \"Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025\") [Bei Landewyck bildet wie schon im Vorjahr die Mademoiselle den Hauptblickfang des Messestands auf der Intertabac.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil.

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: Unknown | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury | Legal Status: Unknown | Lukoil is mentioned as a major Russian oil company subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions; no further financial crime or compliance details are provided in the content.', hyde_score=0.59),\n",

If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: Unknown | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury | Legal Status: Unknown | Lukoil is mentioned as a major Russian oil company subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions; no further financial crime or compliance details are provided in the content.', hyde_score=0.59),\n",

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

[Елена Лесничая](https://finance.mail.ru/author/294-elena-lesnichaya/) Автор Финансы Mail «Нет, ни в коем случае. Это чистая сделка. Как только это будет сделано, все. Мы больше не имеем никакого отношения к “[Лукойлу](https://news.mail.ru/company/lukoyl/)”, — сказал он в интервью телеканалу Bloomberg TV. Он добавил, что многие из зарубежных активов «Лукойла» хорошо вписываются в портфель Gunvor. В частности, речь идет о [трейдинге](https://finance.mail.ru/guide/trejding-197/) и нефтепереработке, которыми уже занимается компания. Но некоторые активы, возможно, лучше будет передать в другие руки. «Лукойл» ранее сообщил, что получил от Gunvor Group предложение о приобретении дочернего общества Lukoil International GmbH, владеющего его зарубежными активами. «Лукойл» уже согласовал ключевые условия и обязался не вести переговоры с другими потенциальными покупателями. [Минфин](https://news.mail.ru/company/minfin/) США 22 октября ввел санкции против «Лукойла» и его [дочерних компаний](https://finance.mail.ru/card/dochernyaya-kompaniya-944/), где он владеет долей более 50%.

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison». Dans le «lobby», beaucoup de gens parlent russe. «C’est un peu la nouvelle rue du Rhône en beaucoup plus moderne», estime un acteur du secteur qui, lui, est toujours\", summary='Date: 2023-11-21 | Source: Public Eye | Legal Status: Unknown | No financial crime or compliance information is present in the content regarding Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.39),\n",

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

Dans le même temps, l’armée russe a affirmé avoir conquis deux autres villages, Sadové dans la région de Kharkiv (nord-est) et Krasnoguirské dans celle de Zaporijjia (sud), où les forces ukrainiennes, en infériorité numérique, perdent progressivement du terrain. Les troupes russes, qui s’efforcent depuis près de quatre ans d’envahir ce pays, prennent actuellement pour cible, à l’approche de l’hiver, un réseau énergétique déjà fragile. Dans un message en ligne, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a déclaré que les Russes avaient visé des civils et des installations énergétiques dans dix régions, dont celle de la capitale Kiev, au cours de leur nouvelle attaque aérienne massive dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. «Nous comptons sur l’Amérique, l’Europe et les pays du G7 pour ne pas ignorer la volonté de Moscou de tout détruire», a-t-il insisté, appelant à de nouvelles sanctions pour contraindre la Russie à mettre fin à la guerre. L’armée de l’air ukrainienne a de son côté dit avoir abattu 623 des 653 drones et 52 missiles ennemis qu’elle a recensés dans l’espace aérien de l’Ukraine au cours de la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. Les journalistes de l’AFP ont pour leur part entendu des drones russes survoler Kiev. «Un «coup dur» DTEK, la plus grande entreprise énergétique privée d’Ukraine, a signalé que des centrales électriques avaient été endommagées dans plusieurs régions, sans préciser lesquelles. Son PDG, Maxim Timtchenko, a dénoncé un «coup dur porté à nos efforts pour assurer la continuité de l’approvisionnement en électricité cet hiver». La compagnie nationale d\\'électricité Ukrenergo a concédé que ce nouveau raid avait - à nouveau - placé son réseau dans une situation difficile et que des coupures de courant persisteraient dans l’ensemble de l’Ukraine jusqu\\'à jeudi soir. Des coupures d\\'électricité «continues» pourraient en outre être imposées dans toutes les régions dès vendredi, a-t-elle ajouté. Dans la région occidentale de Lviv, frontalière de la Pologne, le gouverneur a reconnu que deux installations énergétiques aient été touchées. Le ministère russe de la Défense a de son côté expliqué avoir lancé une vaste opération à l’aide de missiles et de drones contre des sites militaro-industriels, des installations énergétiques et des bases aériennes ukrainiennes. L’armée russe attaque chaque hiver depuis 2022 les infrastructures électriques de l’Ukraine, la contraignant à des restrictions dans l’alimentation en électricité et à importer de l\\'énergie. Un lourd bilan humain Dans la ville de Zaporijjia (sud-est), deux personnes ont été tuées et 23 blessées, dont six enfants, selon le chef de la région militaire. Un journaliste de l’AFP a vu un immeuble d’habitation ravagé et des secouristes déblayer les décombres. L’administration régionale de Vinnytsia (centre-ouest) a fait état de cinq blessés, dont une fillette de sept ans qui est par la suite morte à l’hôpital. Le ministère russe de la Défense a quant à lui déclaré que 170 drones ukrainiens avaient été abattus pendant la nuit, dont 48 dans la région de Briansk, à la frontière avec l’Ukraine, et neuf dans celle de Moscou. L’armée russe bombarde presque quotidiennement les zones d’habitation et les infrastructures civiles en Ukraine depuis le début de l’invasion en février 2022. Les Ukrainiens ripostent par des frappes de longue portée, le plus souvent avec des drones. Ces derniers mois, ils ciblent surtout les infrastructures énergétiques russes avec l’objectif de perturber les exportations de pétrole et de réduire le financement de l’effort de guerre de la Russie.

While no formal charges have been publicly disclosed, the company’s extensive international dealings place it under heightened scrutiny by financial institutions assessing counterparty risk.\\n\\nFrom an AML and KYC perspective, Lukoil’s transaction monitoring frameworks would be expected to identify red flags such as complex ownership structures obscuring beneficial ownership, involvement of politically exposed persons (PEPs), and atypical transaction patterns inconsistent with declared business activities. Given the oil and gas sector’s susceptibility to elevated money laundering risks, institutions partnering with Lukoil would need to conduct enhanced due diligence, including rigorous beneficial ownership verification and continuous monitoring of suspicious activity reports (SARs) to mitigate exposure to illicit finance.\\n\\nRegulatory enforcement agencies have historically maintained a cautious stance toward entities linked to high-risk sectors and jurisdictions with known sanction vulnerabilities. Although no current consent orders or settlements explicitly naming Lukoil have been confirmed, precedent cases involving comparable energy firms suggest that probes into AML compliance gaps or sanctions circumvention could lead to significant fines or restrictive measures. Banks considering correspondent banking or other financial relationships with Lukoil are advised to weigh the potential for intensified regulatory scrutiny and the necessity of robust compliance controls.\\n\\nIn summary, while Lukoil has not been conclusively implicated in money laundering offenses, the company’s profile within a high-risk sector and jurisdiction underscores the importance of vigilant AML and KYC practices to manage legal and reputational risks effectively.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil Transaction Patterns Under Scrutiny for Potential Money Laundering Risks\\n\\nA detailed forensic review highlights irregularities in Lukoil’s financial flows suggesting heightened money laundering vulnerabilities.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the oil and gas sector, has come under analytical scrutiny for its transaction flows across multiple jurisdictions, where cash intensity and cross-border transfers raise concerns about potential layering and structuring activities. The company’s complex network of counterparties and subsidiaries, some operating in high-risk regions, has prompted closer examination of its financial conduct within the energy sector’s heightened AML risk environment.\\n\\nStandard anti-money laundering (AML) protocols emphasize robust know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, transaction monitoring, and the filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs) to detect and mitigate laundering risks. In Lukoil’s case, forensic analysis points to patterns such as frequent low-value transactions just below reporting thresholds, unusual correspondent banking relationships, and opaque beneficial ownership structures that may obscure politically exposed persons (PEPs) or sanctioned entities. These red flags typically warrant enhanced due diligence and ongoing surveillance to prevent illicit fund flows.\\n\\nRegulatory bodies have reportedly initiated probes into Lukoil’s compliance with AML standards, focusing on whether the company’s internal controls sufficiently address risks related to cross-border payments and cash-intensive operations. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the investigation underscores the increasing enforcement emphasis on energy sector firms and their susceptibility to money laundering through layering and structuring tactics. The outcome of these inquiries may influence future regulatory expectations and penalties.\\n\\nLukoil remains at the center of a complex financial forensic review where transaction anomalies suggest potential money laundering vulnerabilities, highlighting the critical importance of stringent AML and KYC frameworks in the oil and gas industry.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil Under Scrutiny for Alleged Money Laundering Risks in Operational Controls\\n\\nA detailed evaluation of Lukoil’s internal governance highlights potential vulnerabilities in the company’s anti-money laundering frameworks within the oil and gas sector.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the Russian energy industry, has come under hypothetical examination regarding operational weaknesses that could elevate its exposure to money laundering risks. Given the complexity of the sector and the company’s extensive network of third-party relationships, the robustness of Lukoil’s internal controls and risk management systems is critical to mitigating illicit financial flows.\\n\\nKey to assessing Lukoil’s risk profile is the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This includes rigorous beneficial ownership verification, enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs), and comprehensive transaction monitoring designed to detect suspicious activity reports (SARs). The company’s correspondent banking arrangements and third-party governance frameworks must be scrutinized for gaps that could allow circumvention of sanctions or inadequate identification of high-risk counterparties. Failure to maintain a dynamic and risk-sensitive AML program could result in operational lapses that translate into elevated regulatory and reputational risk.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have hypothetically initiated probes into Lukoil’s compliance with AML obligations, focusing on whether deficiencies in internal controls have facilitated money laundering activities. While no formal consent order or settlement has been disclosed, ongoing investigations suggest heightened supervisory attention. Potential allegations may involve insufficient transaction monitoring and lapses in third-party due diligence, raising concerns about the effectiveness of Lukoil’s risk mitigation strategies. The outcome of such regulatory scrutiny could prompt enforcement actions with financial penalties or mandated remediation measures.\\n\\nIn summary, Lukoil’s operational risk and third-party governance assessment underscores the importance of stringent AML controls within the company’s complex transactional environment. Ensuring robust internal frameworks remains essential to preventing money laundering risks that could undermine Lukoil’s standing and compliance posture.',\n",

While no formal charges have been publicly confirmed, investigative sources suggest that the company’s correspondent banking relationships and cross-border transactions are being examined for compliance gaps.\\n\\nAnti-money laundering (AML) frameworks typically require robust know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, including thorough verification of beneficial ownership and continuous transaction monitoring to detect suspicious activity reports (SARs). In Lukoil’s case, risk indicators such as involvement with politically exposed persons (PEPs), complex ownership structures, and transactions routed through high-risk jurisdictions have reportedly raised red flags. Effective AML controls and enhanced due diligence are critical to mitigating reputational risks associated with these factors.\\n\\nRegulatory agencies appear to be conducting a probe into Lukoil’s adherence to sanctions and AML compliance standards, with some reports alluding to potential consent orders or settlements aimed at resolving outstanding concerns. While details remain limited, the ongoing investigation underscores the heightened enforcement posture toward energy firms implicated in financial misconduct, reflecting broader global efforts to tighten AML oversight.\\n\\nLukoil’s situation illustrates the persistent challenges in managing reputational risk amid allegations of money laundering, emphasizing the importance of rigorous AML and KYC practices to safeguard corporate integrity and stakeholder trust.\",\n",
       "  'Lukoil Faces Scrutiny Over Alleged Money Laundering Risks in Oil Sector\\n\\nRecent developments have raised questions about Lukoil’s ownership transparency and the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering controls within the oil industry.  \\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the Russian oil sector, has come under hypothetical regulatory scrutiny concerning potential money laundering activities linked to its complex ownership structure and cross-border transactions. Given the high-risk nature of the energy sector and Lukoil’s extensive correspondent banking relationships, the adequacy of its know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, beneficial ownership disclosures, and politically exposed person (PEP) screening protocols are critical to mitigating financial crime risks. Typical red flags in such cases include opaque beneficial ownership layers, involvement of PEPs without clear due diligence, unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with business profiles, and gaps in transaction monitoring systems that could allow suspicious activity to go unreported.\\n\\nRegulatory probes into Lukoil’s compliance framework have reportedly focused on whether the company’s internal controls sufficiently identify and escalate suspicious activity reports (SARs) related to potential money laundering. Enforcement authorities are examining if Lukoil’s AML program aligns with international standards, particularly regarding enhanced due diligence for PEPs and sanctions screening. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the ongoing investigation underscores the importance of robust AML controls in sectors vulnerable to illicit finance. The scrutiny also reflects broader regulatory efforts to clamp down on correspondent banking exposures that may facilitate laundering through multinational energy corporations.\\n\\nAs Lukoil navigates these hypothetical compliance challenges, the transparency of its ownership and the rigor of its AML screening processes remain central to safeguarding its standing and preventing hidden risks that could compromise the integrity of financial institutions engaged with the company.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil’s Cross-Border Correspondent Banking Channels Under Scrutiny for Potential Money Laundering Exposure\\n\\nAn examination of Lukoil’s international banking relationships highlights risks related to complex cross-border transactions and jurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering controls.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the energy sector, operates extensive correspondent banking networks that span multiple jurisdictions. These cross-border channels facilitate large volumes of transactions, some of which have drawn attention due to potential exposure to money laundering risks. Given Lukoil’s engagement in regions where regulatory oversight varies, the company’s banking relationships may intersect with jurisdictions identified as having deficient AML frameworks or heightened financial crime vulnerabilities.\\n\\nKey AML and KYC processes relevant to Lukoil’s correspondent banking exposure include robust transaction monitoring, comprehensive beneficial ownership identification, and enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs). Risk indicators typical in such environments involve unusual transaction patterns, rapid movement of funds across multiple correspondent accounts, and dealings with entities subject to sanctions or located in high-risk jurisdictions. Suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by correspondent banks could signal underlying concerns, necessitating ongoing compliance vigilance to mitigate potential criminal exploitation.\\n\\nRegulatory and enforcement authorities have reportedly initiated probes focusing on Lukoil’s correspondent banking channels, examining whether adequate controls were in place to prevent illicit financial flows. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the scrutiny reflects broader regulatory emphasis on cross-border correspondent banking as a vector for money laundering. Allegations suggest that gaps in KYC procedures or transaction monitoring may have allowed suspicious funds to move undetected, prompting calls for strengthened oversight and compliance enhancements.\\n\\nLukoil’s international correspondent banking exposure underscores the challenges faced by global energy firms in managing AML risks amid complex cross-border financial networks and jurisdictions with varying regulatory standards.'],\n",

      "**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n",
      "\n",
      "Lukoil is currently subject to severe, ongoing sanctions and enforcement actions by the UK, U.S., and EU, with no evidence of fines paid or settlement efforts. The most serious issue is the imposition of full asset freezes and active criminal investigations into sanctions violations, including the attempted seizure of a $45 million aircraft. All major actions are recent (2022–2025), indicating unresolved and escalating risk. There is no evidence of remediation, leadership accountability, or system improvements. The total confirmed fines paid to date are €0, but the scale and breadth of sanctions represent a critical risk. \n",

       "  AIMessage(content='**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\\n\\nLukoil is currently subject to severe, ongoing sanctions and enforcement actions by the UK, U.S., and EU, with no evidence of fines paid or settlement efforts. The most serious issue is the imposition of full asset freezes and active criminal investigations into sanctions violations, including the attempted seizure of a $45 million aircraft. All major actions are recent (2022–2025), indicating unresolved and escalating risk. There is no evidence of remediation, leadership accountability, or system improvements. The total confirmed fines paid to date are €0, but the scale and breadth of sanctions represent a critical risk. \\n\\n**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\\n\\n- **Sanctions Violations (2022–2025):**  \\n  - On October 15, 2025, the UK imposed full asset freezing sanctions on Lukoil and its subsidiaries, marking the first such action by the UK, U.S., or EU.  \\n  - On October 22–23, 2023, the U.S. Treasury and EU imposed sanctions on Lukoil and its trading unit, requiring cessation of all transactions and asset freezes.  \\n  - On September 1, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a warrant to seize a $45 million aircraft owned by Lukoil, citing ongoing investigations into sanctions violations.  \\n- **Nature:** These are not isolated incidents but coordinated, multi-jurisdictional actions targeting the core business and assets of Lukoil.\\n\\n**3. CURRENT STATUS**\\n\\n- **Active Investigations:**  \\n  - At least three ongoing enforcement actions/investigations (UK, U.S., EU) as of 2025-10-15.  \\n  - No cases have been dismissed or settled; no fines have been paid.\\n- **Investigating Authorities:**  \\n  - UK government (sanctions authority)  \\n  - U.S. Treasury and U.S. District Court (criminal/civil enforcement)  \\n  - EU sanctions authorities\\n- **Geographic Spread:**  \\n  - UK, U.S., EU, and Middle East (via Litasco Middle East DMCC)\\n- **Settlement Efforts:**  \\n  - None reported; no evidence of leadership change, system improvements, or public remediation.\\n\\n**4. TRAJECTORY**\\n\\n- **Trend:**  \\n  - Risk is increasing, with the most severe actions (full asset freezes) occurring most recently (2025-10-15).  \\n  - No indication of improvement or reform; all actions are unresolved and escalating.\\n- **Quote:**  \\n  - “On October 15, 2025, the UK designated Lukoil as an asset freeze target under its expanded Russia-related sanctions regime…” (2025-10-15)\\n\\n**5. RISK RATING**\\n\\n- **HIGH**  \\n  - Justification: Multiple, ongoing criminal and civil investigations; full asset freezes in major jurisdictions; no evidence of remediation or settlement; risk is escalating and unresolved.\\n\\n**6.

Alertă: Rusia poate ataca NATO # După gratii, după ce și-a luat telefoane de ultimă generație: Cum ar fi obținut banii un bărbat din Bălți ###### 23 octombrie 2025, ora 04:51 **Un tnăr din Bălți a fost condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare după ce s-ar fi dat drept angajat al unei bănci și a lăsat o femeie fără peste 85.000 de lei. Ulterior, din banii obținuți ilegal și-a cumpărat telefoane de ultimă generație.** Potrivit unui comunicat emis de Procuratura Generală, tnărul ar fi acționat sub îndrumarea unui membru al unui grup infracțional organizat, cu care ar fi comunicat prin rețeaua „Telegram”. Gruparea, alcătuită din persoane încă neidentificate, ar fi fost formată în scopul comiterii mai multor escrocherii și funcționa după o schemă bine pusă la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol precis în înșelarea victimelor și obținerea ilegală a banilor. Astfel, pe 25 aprilie 2025, membrii grupului infracțional ar fi apelat o femeie din Chișinău, pretinznd că sunt reprezentanți ai unei bănci. Sub motivul că pe contul ei s-ar fi detectat tentative de tranzacții neautorizate, aceștia ar fi convins-o să le ofere parola de acces la cardul bancar. Ulterior, la instrucțiunile grupului, inculpatul s-ar fi deplasat la un bancomat din Bălți, unde a extras suma de 8.000 de lei din contul victimei. În aceeași zi, folosind datele bancare obținute ilegal, acesta a efectuat achiziții frauduloase într-un magazin de electronice, cumpărnd trei telefoane mobile de ultimă generație, în valoare totală de 79.296 de lei. Prin hotărrea emisă de Judecătoria Bălți, inculpatul a fost găsit vinovat și condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare, într-un penitenciar de tip semiînchis. Instanța a mai dispus și confiscarea bunurilor dobndite prin mijloace frauduloase.

Об этом [сообщается на сайте](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0225) американского Минфина. Ведомство называет Grinex наследницей закрывшейся российской криптобиржи Garantex, которая, по его данным, «напрямую содействовала» киберпреступникам и обработала с 2019 года трансакции, связанные с незаконной деятельностью, на более чем $100 миллионов. Минфин США внес Garantex в санкционный список в апреле 2022 года. Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex, как утверждает ведомство, для уклонения от ограничительных мер. Garantex, основанная в 2019 году в Эстонии и ведущая деятельность в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, по данным Минфина США, обслуживала даркнет-рынки и группы операторов программ-вымогателей, включая Conti, LockBit и Ryuk. В феврале 2022 года компания Garantex лишилась эстонской лицензии на предоставление услуг в сфере цифровых активов после того, как подразделение финансовой разведки Эстонии выявило критические нарушения в системе противодействия отмыванию денег и финансированию терроризма (AML/CFT) и обнаружило связи между Garantex и кошельками, используемыми для преступной деятельности. В марте 2025 года американские и европейские правоохранители заблокировали домен Garantex и заморозили $26 миллионов, после чего клиенты и активы были переведены на новую площадку — Grinex. В пресс-релизе Минфина США подчеркивается, что Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex специально «для обхода санкций». Кроме того, под санкции Минфина США попали трое руководителей Garantex — ее сооснователь Сергей Менделеев, коммерческий директор Александр Мира Серда и региональный директор Павел Каравацкий — и шесть компаний из России и Кыргызстана, которые, как заявило ведомство, «поддерживали участие биржи во вредоносной кибердеятельности». Это кыргызстанская Old Vector, а также российские A7, A71 и A7 Agent, участвовавшие в выпуске рублевого стейблкоина A7A5. Его, по версии Управления по контролю за иностранными активами Министерства финансов США, Garantex использовала для перевода средств клиентам и обхода ограничений. Кроме того, под американские санкции попали проекты InDeFi Bank и Exved.

Se întâmplă după ce oamenii legii au descins cu mai multe percheziții în cadrul unui dosar penal. Potrivit surselor noastre, Chitorog ar fi omul de legătură între gruparea din Rusia și cele din Republica Moldova care introduc bani pentru influențarea alegerilor parlamentare din 28 septembrie. În fața magistraților a apărut și un alt membru al organizației criminale. Cei doi au fost plasați în arest preventiv pentru 30 de zile. Suspecții riscă pedepse cuprinse între opt și 15 ani de închisoare. Ședința de astăzi a durat aproximativ o oră și s-a desfășurat cu ușile închise. Echipa noastră a solicitat explicații privind interdicția de acces pentru presă și restricțiile impuse jurnaliștilor. Angajatul responsabil de securitate a declarat că nu face decât să execute indicațiile primite. Potrivit procurorului de caz, învinuiții sunt certați pentru organizarea și conducerea unei organizații criminale. GHEORGHE SOLOMON, procurorul de caz: _\"- Sunt persoane învinuite de săvârșirea infracțiunii prevăzute de articolul 284, aliniatul 1 în complicitate._ _- Ce prevede acest articol?_ _- Organizarea, conducerea unei organizații criminale. În privința persoanelor a fost aplicat arest preventiv pe un termen de 30 de zile. Au fost examinate materialele care au fost anexate la demersuri. La moment sunt întreprinse măsuri de investigație._ _- Cealaltă persoană de ce nu a fost adusă în fața judecătorilor?_ _- Este un drept procesual al învinuitului. Nu a dorit să se prezinte. Avocatul a semnat acest refuz. Judecătorul a admis această cerere. Persoanele menționate se bucură de prezumția nevinovăției până la emiterea unei sentințe definitive în privința acestora.\"_ Ofițerii Direcției combaterea criminalității organizate a Inspectoratului Național de Investigații, în comun cu Procuratura Hâncești – oficiul Leova, au desfășurat, pe 2 și 3 septembrie, nouă percheziții la domiciliile și în automobilele unor persoane vizate într-un dosar penal privind crearea și conducerea unei organizații criminale. Poliția precizează că în cadrul anchetei au fost recunoscute drept învinuiți doi bărbați apropiați autorității criminale„Kitaeț”. Unul dintre ei, cunoscut sub pseudonimul „Vova Davai”, era considerat „supraveghetor” al activităților ilegale ale grupărilor afiliate și avea rolul de a gestiona „visteria criminală” – un fond în care se acumulau lunar cel puțin 100.000 de dolari din activități ilegale. Oamenii legii au ridicat trei automobile de lux, sume de bani, telefoane, muniții și alte bunuri, valoarea totală a acestora depășind două milioane de lei. Potrivit surselor Jurnal TV, „Vova Davai” ar fi omul de legătură între gruparea din Rusia și cele din Republica Moldova care introduc bani pentru influențarea alegerilor parlamentare din 28 septembrie. ###### Opinia ta contează.

On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Dans le même temps, l’armée russe a affirmé avoir conquis deux autres villages, Sadové dans la région de Kharkiv (nord-est) et Krasnoguirské dans celle de Zaporijjia (sud), où les forces ukrainiennes, en infériorité numérique, perdent progressivement du terrain. Les troupes russes, qui s’efforcent depuis près de quatre ans d’envahir ce pays, prennent actuellement pour cible, à l’approche de l’hiver, un réseau énergétique déjà fragile. Dans un message en ligne, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a déclaré que les Russes avaient visé des civils et des installations énergétiques dans dix régions, dont celle de la capitale Kiev, au cours de leur nouvelle attaque aérienne massive dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. «Nous comptons sur l’Amérique, l’Europe et les pays du G7 pour ne pas ignorer la volonté de Moscou de tout détruire», a-t-il insisté, appelant à de nouvelles sanctions pour contraindre la Russie à mettre fin à la guerre. L’armée de l’air ukrainienne a de son côté dit avoir abattu 623 des 653 drones et 52 missiles ennemis qu’elle a recensés dans l’espace aérien de l’Ukraine au cours de la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. Les journalistes de l’AFP ont pour leur part entendu des drones russes survoler Kiev. «Un «coup dur» DTEK, la plus grande entreprise énergétique privée d’Ukraine, a signalé que des centrales électriques avaient été endommagées dans plusieurs régions, sans préciser lesquelles. Son PDG, Maxim Timtchenko, a dénoncé un «coup dur porté à nos efforts pour assurer la continuité de l’approvisionnement en électricité cet hiver». La compagnie nationale d\\'électricité Ukrenergo a concédé que ce nouveau raid avait - à nouveau - placé son réseau dans une situation difficile et que des coupures de courant persisteraient dans l’ensemble de l’Ukraine jusqu\\'à jeudi soir. Des coupures d\\'électricité «continues» pourraient en outre être imposées dans toutes les régions dès vendredi, a-t-elle ajouté. Dans la région occidentale de Lviv, frontalière de la Pologne, le gouverneur a reconnu que deux installations énergétiques aient été touchées. Le ministère russe de la Défense a de son côté expliqué avoir lancé une vaste opération à l’aide de missiles et de drones contre des sites militaro-industriels, des installations énergétiques et des bases aériennes ukrainiennes. L’armée russe attaque chaque hiver depuis 2022 les infrastructures électriques de l’Ukraine, la contraignant à des restrictions dans l’alimentation en électricité et à importer de l\\'énergie. Un lourd bilan humain Dans la ville de Zaporijjia (sud-est), deux personnes ont été tuées et 23 blessées, dont six enfants, selon le chef de la région militaire. Un journaliste de l’AFP a vu un immeuble d’habitation ravagé et des secouristes déblayer les décombres. L’administration régionale de Vinnytsia (centre-ouest) a fait état de cinq blessés, dont une fillette de sept ans qui est par la suite morte à l’hôpital. Le ministère russe de la Défense a quant à lui déclaré que 170 drones ukrainiens avaient été abattus pendant la nuit, dont 48 dans la région de Briansk, à la frontière avec l’Ukraine, et neuf dans celle de Moscou. L’armée russe bombarde presque quotidiennement les zones d’habitation et les infrastructures civiles en Ukraine depuis le début de l’invasion en février 2022. Les Ukrainiens ripostent par des frappes de longue portée, le plus souvent avec des drones. Ces derniers mois, ils ciblent surtout les infrastructures énergétiques russes avec l’objectif de perturber les exportations de pétrole et de réduire le financement de l’effort de guerre de la Russie.

Zigaretten auf dem Schwarzmarkt. Illegale Zigaretten kosteten den Staat im letzten Jahr allein 401 Millionen Euro. Ab 1. September starten der BDZ und Philip Morris Deutschland deshalb eine gemeinsame Aufklärungskampagne. von Sprit+ --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [Folgen auf:](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJqxqAwwgI_tAg?hl=de&gl=DE&ceid=DE:de) --- * [#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\") * [#Tabakkonsum](/tag/tabakkonsum-3368052 \"Tabakkonsum\") * [#Tabaksteuer](/tag/tabaksteuer-3692852 \"Tabaksteuer\") Nur 38 Prozent der Befragten lehnen den Kauf illegaler Waren – etwa geschmuggelter Zigaretten – konsequent ab. Gleichzeitig zeigt fast die Hälfte (48 Prozent) zumindest Verständnis für solche Käufe. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer repräsentativen Online-[Umfrage](/tag/umfrage-1712250 \"Mehr zum Thema Umfrage\") des Meinungsforschungsinstituts Bonsai Public im Auftrag von [Philip Morris](/tag/philip-morris-2020390 \"Mehr zum Thema Philip Morris\") Deutschland*1*. Kriminelle Strukturen scheinen bereits tief in der Gesellschaft verankert zu sein und zunehmend akzeptiert oder in Kauf genommen zu werden. Angesichts wachsender Steuerverluste, eines florierenden Schwarzmarkts und der Stärkung krimineller Netzwerke, die mit Menschenhandel, Drogen- und Waffenkriminalität verbunden sind, hält Philip Morris dies für ein besorgniserregendes Signal. Die Bedrohung durch die Organisierte Kriminalität wird von acht von zehn Befragten als hoch oder sehr hoch eingeschätzt – und das nicht ohne Grund: 59 Prozent erleben sie bereits als Teil ihres Alltags und ist davon überzeugt, dass sie auch in der eigenen Region stattfindet. Deutschland als Produktionsort für illegale Zigaretten – dem Haupttreiber und eine zentrale Finanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität – können sich immerhin über 40 Prozent vorstellen. Damit ist das Thema für viele keine abstrakte Bedrohung in fernen Ländern mehr. Fast die Hälfte der Befragten fordert daher, dass die Politik dem Kampf gegen Organisierte Kriminalität deutlich mehr Priorität einräumen muss. Gleichzeitig zeigt die Umfrage erhebliche Wissenslücken: Die Rolle illegaler Zigaretten als eine Hauptfinanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität wird stark unterschätzt. ## Die Kampagne Genau hier will die neue bundesweite Aufklärungskampagne von Philip Morris Deutschland und der BDZ Deutsche Zoll- und Finanzgewerkschaft ansetzen. Ziel ist es, auf den illegalen Handel und dessen Verbindungen zur Organisierten Kriminalität aufmerksam zu machen. Die Kernbotschaft lautet: \"Der Handel mit illegalen Tabakwaren ist kein Kavaliersdelikt – er gefährdet die öffentliche [Sicherheit](/tag/sicherheit-1366953 \"Mehr zum Thema Sicherheit\"), verursacht erhebliche wirtschaftliche Schäden und stärkt kriminelle Netzwerke.\" Geplant sind Informationsmaßnahmen im öffentlichen Raum. Auch das Bild eines stetigen Stroms illegaler [Produkte](/tag/produkte-1654301 \"Mehr zum Thema Produkte\") wird aufgegriffen: Insgesamt werden 17 [Lkw](/tag/lkw-1359261 \"Mehr zum Thema Lkw\") mit bedruckten Heckflächen unterwegs sein, um Aufmerksamkeit auf das Thema zu lenken. Im Jahr 2024 wurden hierzulande schätzungsweise 1,7 Milliarden illegale Zigaretten konsumiert – ein Lkw steht damit symbolisch für 100 Millionen illegal konsumierte Zigaretten. ## Wirtschaft und Sicherheit werden untergraben Allein in Deutschland entgingen dem Staat im vergangenen Jahr rund 401 Millionen Euro an Steuereinnahmen allein durch den Konsum illegal hergestellter Zigaretten (Quelle: KPMG Report 2024). Gewinne aus dem illegalen Handel fließen häufig in andere kriminelle Aktivitäten. Damit untergräbt der illegale Zigarettenmarkt nicht nur wirtschaftliche Strukturen, sondern auch die öffentliche Sicherheit. \"Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage sprechen eine deutliche Sprache: Eine alarmierende Akzeptanz illegaler Produkte untergräbt unsere Gesellschaft und stärkt die Organisierte Kriminalität. Besonders der Handel mit illegalen Zigaretten spielt dabei eine große Rolle – er finanziert kriminelle Strukturen. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Organisierte Kriminalität keine Randerscheinung ist, sondern eine präsente Bedrohung für die öffentliche Sicherheit“, so Tammo Körner, Senior Manager Fiscal Affairs & ITP bei Philip Morris Deutschland. Nach Ansicht von Phlip Morris ist ein entschlossenes Vorgehen auf mehreren Ebenen notwendig: * Die Kriminalitätsbekämpfung muss gestärkt werden. * Eine verbesserte internationale Zusammenarbeit gegen die meist grenzüberschreitend operierenden Netzwerke. * Eine umfassenden Aufklärungsarbeit, um Bürgern für die Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Kauf illegaler Zigaretten und der Finanzierung krimineller Aktivitäten zu sensibilisieren. Thomas Liebel, Bundesvorsitzender der BDZ, ergänzt: \"Der Zoll ist der Schutzwall, der Staatseinnahmen sichert, die Wirtschaft vor kriminellen Einflüssen bewahrt und die Sicherheit der Bevölkerung gewährleistet. Doch trotz wachsender Aufgaben, etwa angesichts der Zunahme illegaler Produktionsstätten für Zigaretten und immer professioneller organisierter Geldwäsche, wird die Modernisierung des Zolls durch anhaltende Sparmaßnahmen gebremst – und das kommt die Allgemeinheit teuer zu stehen.\" *1Online-Umfrage im August 2025 unter 1.000 Personen in Deutschland im Alter von 18 bis 69 Jahren.* --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [ZUR STARTSEITE](/ \"Zur Startseite\") --- ### HASHTAG --- ## *[#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\")* 22.08.2025 [#Intertabac](/tag/intertabac-1986923 \"Intertabac\") ## [Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025](/nachrichten/tabak-und-tabakersatz/nicht-verpassen-landewyck-auf-der-intertabac-2025-3701358 \"Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025\") [Bei Landewyck bildet wie schon im Vorjahr die Mademoiselle den Hauptblickfang des Messestands auf der Intertabac.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil.

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: Unknown | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury | Legal Status: Unknown | Lukoil is mentioned as a major Russian oil company subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions; no further financial crime or compliance details are provided in the content.', hyde_score=0.59),\n",

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: Unknown | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury | Legal Status: Unknown | Lukoil is mentioned as a major Russian oil company subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions; no further financial crime or compliance details are provided in the content.', hyde_score=0.59),\n",

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

[Елена Лесничая](https://finance.mail.ru/author/294-elena-lesnichaya/) Автор Финансы Mail «Нет, ни в коем случае. Это чистая сделка. Как только это будет сделано, все. Мы больше не имеем никакого отношения к “[Лукойлу](https://news.mail.ru/company/lukoyl/)”, — сказал он в интервью телеканалу Bloomberg TV. Он добавил, что многие из зарубежных активов «Лукойла» хорошо вписываются в портфель Gunvor. В частности, речь идет о [трейдинге](https://finance.mail.ru/guide/trejding-197/) и нефтепереработке, которыми уже занимается компания. Но некоторые активы, возможно, лучше будет передать в другие руки. «Лукойл» ранее сообщил, что получил от Gunvor Group предложение о приобретении дочернего общества Lukoil International GmbH, владеющего его зарубежными активами. «Лукойл» уже согласовал ключевые условия и обязался не вести переговоры с другими потенциальными покупателями. [Минфин](https://news.mail.ru/company/minfin/) США 22 октября ввел санкции против «Лукойла» и его [дочерних компаний](https://finance.mail.ru/card/dochernyaya-kompaniya-944/), где он владеет долей более 50%.

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison». Dans le «lobby», beaucoup de gens parlent russe. «C’est un peu la nouvelle rue du Rhône en beaucoup plus moderne», estime un acteur du secteur qui, lui, est toujours\", summary='Date: 2023-11-21 | Source: Public Eye | Legal Status: Unknown | No financial crime or compliance information is present in the content regarding Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.39),\n",

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

Dans le même temps, l’armée russe a affirmé avoir conquis deux autres villages, Sadové dans la région de Kharkiv (nord-est) et Krasnoguirské dans celle de Zaporijjia (sud), où les forces ukrainiennes, en infériorité numérique, perdent progressivement du terrain. Les troupes russes, qui s’efforcent depuis près de quatre ans d’envahir ce pays, prennent actuellement pour cible, à l’approche de l’hiver, un réseau énergétique déjà fragile. Dans un message en ligne, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a déclaré que les Russes avaient visé des civils et des installations énergétiques dans dix régions, dont celle de la capitale Kiev, au cours de leur nouvelle attaque aérienne massive dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. «Nous comptons sur l’Amérique, l’Europe et les pays du G7 pour ne pas ignorer la volonté de Moscou de tout détruire», a-t-il insisté, appelant à de nouvelles sanctions pour contraindre la Russie à mettre fin à la guerre. L’armée de l’air ukrainienne a de son côté dit avoir abattu 623 des 653 drones et 52 missiles ennemis qu’elle a recensés dans l’espace aérien de l’Ukraine au cours de la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. Les journalistes de l’AFP ont pour leur part entendu des drones russes survoler Kiev. «Un «coup dur» DTEK, la plus grande entreprise énergétique privée d’Ukraine, a signalé que des centrales électriques avaient été endommagées dans plusieurs régions, sans préciser lesquelles. Son PDG, Maxim Timtchenko, a dénoncé un «coup dur porté à nos efforts pour assurer la continuité de l’approvisionnement en électricité cet hiver». La compagnie nationale d\\'électricité Ukrenergo a concédé que ce nouveau raid avait - à nouveau - placé son réseau dans une situation difficile et que des coupures de courant persisteraient dans l’ensemble de l’Ukraine jusqu\\'à jeudi soir. Des coupures d\\'électricité «continues» pourraient en outre être imposées dans toutes les régions dès vendredi, a-t-elle ajouté. Dans la région occidentale de Lviv, frontalière de la Pologne, le gouverneur a reconnu que deux installations énergétiques aient été touchées. Le ministère russe de la Défense a de son côté expliqué avoir lancé une vaste opération à l’aide de missiles et de drones contre des sites militaro-industriels, des installations énergétiques et des bases aériennes ukrainiennes. L’armée russe attaque chaque hiver depuis 2022 les infrastructures électriques de l’Ukraine, la contraignant à des restrictions dans l’alimentation en électricité et à importer de l\\'énergie. Un lourd bilan humain Dans la ville de Zaporijjia (sud-est), deux personnes ont été tuées et 23 blessées, dont six enfants, selon le chef de la région militaire. Un journaliste de l’AFP a vu un immeuble d’habitation ravagé et des secouristes déblayer les décombres. L’administration régionale de Vinnytsia (centre-ouest) a fait état de cinq blessés, dont une fillette de sept ans qui est par la suite morte à l’hôpital. Le ministère russe de la Défense a quant à lui déclaré que 170 drones ukrainiens avaient été abattus pendant la nuit, dont 48 dans la région de Briansk, à la frontière avec l’Ukraine, et neuf dans celle de Moscou. L’armée russe bombarde presque quotidiennement les zones d’habitation et les infrastructures civiles en Ukraine depuis le début de l’invasion en février 2022. Les Ukrainiens ripostent par des frappes de longue portée, le plus souvent avec des drones. Ces derniers mois, ils ciblent surtout les infrastructures énergétiques russes avec l’objectif de perturber les exportations de pétrole et de réduire le financement de l’effort de guerre de la Russie.

While no formal charges have been publicly disclosed, the company’s extensive international dealings place it under heightened scrutiny by financial institutions assessing counterparty risk.\\n\\nFrom an AML and KYC perspective, Lukoil’s transaction monitoring frameworks would be expected to identify red flags such as complex ownership structures obscuring beneficial ownership, involvement of politically exposed persons (PEPs), and atypical transaction patterns inconsistent with declared business activities. Given the oil and gas sector’s susceptibility to elevated money laundering risks, institutions partnering with Lukoil would need to conduct enhanced due diligence, including rigorous beneficial ownership verification and continuous monitoring of suspicious activity reports (SARs) to mitigate exposure to illicit finance.\\n\\nRegulatory enforcement agencies have historically maintained a cautious stance toward entities linked to high-risk sectors and jurisdictions with known sanction vulnerabilities. Although no current consent orders or settlements explicitly naming Lukoil have been confirmed, precedent cases involving comparable energy firms suggest that probes into AML compliance gaps or sanctions circumvention could lead to significant fines or restrictive measures. Banks considering correspondent banking or other financial relationships with Lukoil are advised to weigh the potential for intensified regulatory scrutiny and the necessity of robust compliance controls.\\n\\nIn summary, while Lukoil has not been conclusively implicated in money laundering offenses, the company’s profile within a high-risk sector and jurisdiction underscores the importance of vigilant AML and KYC practices to manage legal and reputational risks effectively.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil Transaction Patterns Under Scrutiny for Potential Money Laundering Risks\\n\\nA detailed forensic review highlights irregularities in Lukoil’s financial flows suggesting heightened money laundering vulnerabilities.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the oil and gas sector, has come under analytical scrutiny for its transaction flows across multiple jurisdictions, where cash intensity and cross-border transfers raise concerns about potential layering and structuring activities. The company’s complex network of counterparties and subsidiaries, some operating in high-risk regions, has prompted closer examination of its financial conduct within the energy sector’s heightened AML risk environment.\\n\\nStandard anti-money laundering (AML) protocols emphasize robust know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, transaction monitoring, and the filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs) to detect and mitigate laundering risks. In Lukoil’s case, forensic analysis points to patterns such as frequent low-value transactions just below reporting thresholds, unusual correspondent banking relationships, and opaque beneficial ownership structures that may obscure politically exposed persons (PEPs) or sanctioned entities. These red flags typically warrant enhanced due diligence and ongoing surveillance to prevent illicit fund flows.\\n\\nRegulatory bodies have reportedly initiated probes into Lukoil’s compliance with AML standards, focusing on whether the company’s internal controls sufficiently address risks related to cross-border payments and cash-intensive operations. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the investigation underscores the increasing enforcement emphasis on energy sector firms and their susceptibility to money laundering through layering and structuring tactics. The outcome of these inquiries may influence future regulatory expectations and penalties.\\n\\nLukoil remains at the center of a complex financial forensic review where transaction anomalies suggest potential money laundering vulnerabilities, highlighting the critical importance of stringent AML and KYC frameworks in the oil and gas industry.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil Under Scrutiny for Alleged Money Laundering Risks in Operational Controls\\n\\nA detailed evaluation of Lukoil’s internal governance highlights potential vulnerabilities in the company’s anti-money laundering frameworks within the oil and gas sector.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the Russian energy industry, has come under hypothetical examination regarding operational weaknesses that could elevate its exposure to money laundering risks. Given the complexity of the sector and the company’s extensive network of third-party relationships, the robustness of Lukoil’s internal controls and risk management systems is critical to mitigating illicit financial flows.\\n\\nKey to assessing Lukoil’s risk profile is the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This includes rigorous beneficial ownership verification, enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs), and comprehensive transaction monitoring designed to detect suspicious activity reports (SARs). The company’s correspondent banking arrangements and third-party governance frameworks must be scrutinized for gaps that could allow circumvention of sanctions or inadequate identification of high-risk counterparties. Failure to maintain a dynamic and risk-sensitive AML program could result in operational lapses that translate into elevated regulatory and reputational risk.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have hypothetically initiated probes into Lukoil’s compliance with AML obligations, focusing on whether deficiencies in internal controls have facilitated money laundering activities. While no formal consent order or settlement has been disclosed, ongoing investigations suggest heightened supervisory attention. Potential allegations may involve insufficient transaction monitoring and lapses in third-party due diligence, raising concerns about the effectiveness of Lukoil’s risk mitigation strategies. The outcome of such regulatory scrutiny could prompt enforcement actions with financial penalties or mandated remediation measures.\\n\\nIn summary, Lukoil’s operational risk and third-party governance assessment underscores the importance of stringent AML controls within the company’s complex transactional environment. Ensuring robust internal frameworks remains essential to preventing money laundering risks that could undermine Lukoil’s standing and compliance posture.',\n",

While no formal charges have been publicly confirmed, investigative sources suggest that the company’s correspondent banking relationships and cross-border transactions are being examined for compliance gaps.\\n\\nAnti-money laundering (AML) frameworks typically require robust know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, including thorough verification of beneficial ownership and continuous transaction monitoring to detect suspicious activity reports (SARs). In Lukoil’s case, risk indicators such as involvement with politically exposed persons (PEPs), complex ownership structures, and transactions routed through high-risk jurisdictions have reportedly raised red flags. Effective AML controls and enhanced due diligence are critical to mitigating reputational risks associated with these factors.\\n\\nRegulatory agencies appear to be conducting a probe into Lukoil’s adherence to sanctions and AML compliance standards, with some reports alluding to potential consent orders or settlements aimed at resolving outstanding concerns. While details remain limited, the ongoing investigation underscores the heightened enforcement posture toward energy firms implicated in financial misconduct, reflecting broader global efforts to tighten AML oversight.\\n\\nLukoil’s situation illustrates the persistent challenges in managing reputational risk amid allegations of money laundering, emphasizing the importance of rigorous AML and KYC practices to safeguard corporate integrity and stakeholder trust.\",\n",
       "  'Lukoil Faces Scrutiny Over Alleged Money Laundering Risks in Oil Sector\\n\\nRecent developments have raised questions about Lukoil’s ownership transparency and the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering controls within the oil industry.  \\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the Russian oil sector, has come under hypothetical regulatory scrutiny concerning potential money laundering activities linked to its complex ownership structure and cross-border transactions. Given the high-risk nature of the energy sector and Lukoil’s extensive correspondent banking relationships, the adequacy of its know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, beneficial ownership disclosures, and politically exposed person (PEP) screening protocols are critical to mitigating financial crime risks. Typical red flags in such cases include opaque beneficial ownership layers, involvement of PEPs without clear due diligence, unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with business profiles, and gaps in transaction monitoring systems that could allow suspicious activity to go unreported.\\n\\nRegulatory probes into Lukoil’s compliance framework have reportedly focused on whether the company’s internal controls sufficiently identify and escalate suspicious activity reports (SARs) related to potential money laundering. Enforcement authorities are examining if Lukoil’s AML program aligns with international standards, particularly regarding enhanced due diligence for PEPs and sanctions screening. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the ongoing investigation underscores the importance of robust AML controls in sectors vulnerable to illicit finance. The scrutiny also reflects broader regulatory efforts to clamp down on correspondent banking exposures that may facilitate laundering through multinational energy corporations.\\n\\nAs Lukoil navigates these hypothetical compliance challenges, the transparency of its ownership and the rigor of its AML screening processes remain central to safeguarding its standing and preventing hidden risks that could compromise the integrity of financial institutions engaged with the company.',\n",
       "  'Lukoil’s Cross-Border Correspondent Banking Channels Under Scrutiny for Potential Money Laundering Exposure\\n\\nAn examination of Lukoil’s international banking relationships highlights risks related to complex cross-border transactions and jurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering controls.\\n\\nLukoil, a major player in the energy sector, operates extensive correspondent banking networks that span multiple jurisdictions. These cross-border channels facilitate large volumes of transactions, some of which have drawn attention due to potential exposure to money laundering risks. Given Lukoil’s engagement in regions where regulatory oversight varies, the company’s banking relationships may intersect with jurisdictions identified as having deficient AML frameworks or heightened financial crime vulnerabilities.\\n\\nKey AML and KYC processes relevant to Lukoil’s correspondent banking exposure include robust transaction monitoring, comprehensive beneficial ownership identification, and enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs). Risk indicators typical in such environments involve unusual transaction patterns, rapid movement of funds across multiple correspondent accounts, and dealings with entities subject to sanctions or located in high-risk jurisdictions. Suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by correspondent banks could signal underlying concerns, necessitating ongoing compliance vigilance to mitigate potential criminal exploitation.\\n\\nRegulatory and enforcement authorities have reportedly initiated probes focusing on Lukoil’s correspondent banking channels, examining whether adequate controls were in place to prevent illicit financial flows. While no formal consent order or settlement has been publicly disclosed, the scrutiny reflects broader regulatory emphasis on cross-border correspondent banking as a vector for money laundering. Allegations suggest that gaps in KYC procedures or transaction monitoring may have allowed suspicious funds to move undetected, prompting calls for strengthened oversight and compliance enhancements.\\n\\nLukoil’s international correspondent banking exposure underscores the challenges faced by global energy firms in managing AML risks amid complex cross-border financial networks and jurisdictions with varying regulatory standards.'],\n",

      "\n",
      "Lukoil is currently subject to severe, ongoing sanctions and enforcement actions by the UK, U.S., and EU, with no evidence of fines paid or settlement efforts. The most serious issue is the imposition of full asset freezes and active criminal investigations into sanctions violations, including the attempted seizure of a $45 million aircraft. All major actions are recent (2022–2025), indicating unresolved and escalating risk. There is no evidence of remediation, leadership accountability, or system improvements. The total confirmed fines paid to date are €0, but the scale and breadth of sanctions represent a critical risk. \n",

      "\n",
      "**3. CURRENT STATUS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Active Investigations:**  \n",
      "  - At least three ongoing enforcement actions/investigations (UK, U.S., EU) as of 2025-10-15.  \n",
      "  - No cases have been dismissed or settled; no fines have been paid.\n",
      "- **Investigating Authorities:**  \n",
      "  - UK government (sanctions authority)  \n",
      "  - U.S. Treasury and U.S. District Court (criminal/civil enforcement)  \n",
      "  - EU sanctions authorities\n",
