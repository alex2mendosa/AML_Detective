    "    \n",

Scopul final era ca acesta să fie documentat și reținut inclusiv pentru implicarea sa în activitatea ilegală a grupării Șor. Declarațiile în acest sens au fost făcute de șeful Inspectoratului General al Poliției (IGP), Viorel Cernăuțeanu, în cadrul emisiunii „Obiectiv Comun” de la** [**TVR Moldova**](https://tvrmoldova.md/article/e24b47905344db85/cernauteanu-ion-perju-a-fost-urmarit-luni-de-zile-pentru-a-deconspira-schema-de-spalare-a-banilor.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawM3Lm9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHohdR4VRumF9Yt2bbhU1u_vKZjXd16CodPpevaJsiCBgl_P_gkqBMKvUQlAn_aem_8EY2HOpc-87_Ts_LZhkMpg)**.** > *„Persoana se află o perioadă îndelungată de timp în vizorul nostru, fiind sub măsuri speciale de investigație. Astfel, s-a stabilit că acesta asigura intermedierea proceselor de convertire, de lichefiere, de spălare de bani pentru gruparea criminală ȘOR și urma să decidem dacă îl reținem sau nu la faza incipientă. Totuși, acest lucru ar fi dat peste cap procesul de documentare a spălării banilor”, a declarat Viorel Cernăuțeanu la* [*TVR Moldova*](https://tvrmoldova.md/article/e24b47905344db85/cernauteanu-ion-perju-a-fost-urmarit-luni-de-zile-pentru-a-deconspira-schema-de-spalare-a-banilor.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawM3Lm9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHohdR4VRumF9Yt2bbhU1u_vKZjXd16CodPpevaJsiCBgl_P_gkqBMKvUQlAn_aem_8EY2HOpc-87_Ts_LZhkMpg)*.* La 16 septembrie curent, oamenii legii au descins cu un șir de percheziții într-o cauză penală pornită pentru evaziune fiscală și spălare de bani. Operațiunea desfășurată a vizat mai multe persoane, precum și companii – de construcții, petroliere și un Trust Media – suspectate că ar fi fost implicate în schema de spălare de bani. > *„În timpul analizei efectuate de oamenii legii s-a ajuns la rețeaua de spălare de bani, schema de finanțare a Trust-ului Media fiind organizată prin intermediul unei companii de construcții, cu angajați străini, care efectua tranzacții fictive prin intermediul unei companii petroliere”,* [*a anunțat*](https://politia.md/ro/politia-actiune/trust-media-responsabil-de-propaganda-pro-rusa-si-dezinformare-finantat-printr-o) *Poliția.* Potrivit [surselor TVR Moldova](https://tvrmoldova.md/article/f5141de745a85bbc/un-gigant-petrolier-lichefia-bani-pentru-sor-detalii-despre-milionul-de-euro-ridicat-de-cna.html), compania petrolieră suspectată de lichefierea banilor prin contracte fictive pentru finanțarea trustului media este ICS Lukoil Moldova, iar fostul polițist Ion Perju [a fost reținut](https://tvrmoldova.md/article/33b81d49070c888c/rezultatele-descinderilor-la-canal-5-si-primul-in-moldova-toti-actorii-schemei-si-rolul-lui-perju.html) pentru că ar fi intermediarul procesului de spălare de bani pentru finanțarea trustului media. Pe lngă Perju, oamenii legii au reținut și alte persoane. > *„Există și alte persoane care sunt vizate și reținute în acest proces de investigații. În timpul descinderilor au fost ridicate materiale și bunuri de la cteva companii. Este vorba de o companie de construcție, o companie petrolieră, sediul unui Trust Media afiliat grupării Șor, domiciliul persoanei vizate, de fapt trei domicilii. Deci, vorbim de un ansamblu de percheziții care nu sunt att de simple și att de rapide”, a explicat Viorel Cernăuțeanu.* „[Primul în Moldova](https://t.me/primulinmd/101783)” a scris pe Telegram că sediul în care activează a fost percheziționat, iar echipamentele au fost confiscate sub pretextul unui „caz de evaziune fiscală și spălare de bani”. > *„Am fost atrași în această situație doar pentru că am furnizat anterior servicii de publicitate unei companii de construcții împotriva căreia a fost pornit un dosar penal.

El a acuzat autoritățile de falsificarea scrutinului și a anunțat că formațiunea sa va contesta rezultatele, deși este vizat în zeci de dosare privind coruperea alegătorilor. „Ceea ce a avut loc ieri nu au fost alegeri, ci o numire. Evident că vom contesta toate rezultatele. Nu vom recunoaște rezultatele alegerilor, pentru că nu au fost alegeri, a fost o numire. Nu mai vorbesc despre faptul că o serie de partide pur și simplu nu au ajuns la alegeri, pentru că au fost eliminate”, a declarat Șor, în direct la televiziunea publică rusă. Liderul blocului „Pobeda” a susținut că dispune de „sute de dovezi” privind falsificarea alegerilor, însă nu a prezentat niciuna. Totodată, el a lansat acuzații false, afirmnd că „CEC încă se teme să publice datele pe secții de votare, pentru ca observatorii din opoziție să nu le poată compara cu cele din procesele-verbale semnate”. Condamnatul fugar a mai spus că partidele afiliate lui vor lupta pentru anularea rezultatelor și vor apela la instanțele naționale și internaționale. Totodată, Șor a anunțat posibile proteste în Republica Moldova, care ar putea avea loc în zilele următoare. Precizăm că limitarea activității partidelor afiliate lui Ilan Șor și excluderea din cursă a unor formațiuni finanțate ilegal de Moscova s-au bazat pe probe prezentate de Poliție, SIS, CNA și Procuratură, care au documentat acceptarea banilor din partea grupărilor criminale și spălarea de fonduri. Potrivit datelor oficiale prezentate după prelucrarea tuturor voturilor din țară și din diaspora, cinci formațiuni politice acced în viitorul Parlament al Republicii Moldova, după alegerile din 28 septembrie. Este vorba despre Partidul Acțiune și Solidaritate (PAS) – care conduce detașat cu 50,20% din voturi – Blocul „Patriotic” (24,17%), Blocul „Alternativa” (7,96%), Partidul Nostru (6,20%) și Partidul „Democrația Acasă” 5,62%).

Au fost realizate și măsuri speciale de investigație, sub filaj.

Sau dacă vrem să desfășurăm această operațiune, dar cu riscul de a pierde procedură spălare de bani. ``` Autor: Viorel Cernăuțeanu, șeful IGP Cernăuțeanu afirmă că în dosarul de finanțare ilegală a Trust Media ar fi implicate și alte persoane. Acesta a confirmat „desfășurarea perchezițiilor și ridicare de materiale, mijloace financiare și bunuri, att de la o companie de construcție, o companie petrolieră, trei domicilii și sediul unei companii media afiliate grupării Șor”, în seara zilei de 16 septembrie. **CONTEXT.** Amintim că oamenii legii [au descins cu percheziții](https://agora.md/2025/09/16/perchezitii-la-trust-media-gruparea-sor-vizata-in-investigatii-de-spalare-de-bani-si-propaganda-pro-rusa-video) la posturile de televiziune, parte a companiei Trust Media.

Alertă: Rusia poate ataca NATO # După gratii, după ce și-a luat telefoane de ultimă generație: Cum ar fi obținut banii un bărbat din Bălți ###### 23 octombrie 2025, ora 04:51 **Un tnăr din Bălți a fost condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare după ce s-ar fi dat drept angajat al unei bănci și a lăsat o femeie fără peste 85.000 de lei. Ulterior, din banii obținuți ilegal și-a cumpărat telefoane de ultimă generație.** Potrivit unui comunicat emis de Procuratura Generală, tnărul ar fi acționat sub îndrumarea unui membru al unui grup infracțional organizat, cu care ar fi comunicat prin rețeaua „Telegram”. Gruparea, alcătuită din persoane încă neidentificate, ar fi fost formată în scopul comiterii mai multor escrocherii și funcționa după o schemă bine pusă la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol precis în înșelarea victimelor și obținerea ilegală a banilor. Astfel, pe 25 aprilie 2025, membrii grupului infracțional ar fi apelat o femeie din Chișinău, pretinznd că sunt reprezentanți ai unei bănci. Sub motivul că pe contul ei s-ar fi detectat tentative de tranzacții neautorizate, aceștia ar fi convins-o să le ofere parola de acces la cardul bancar. Ulterior, la instrucțiunile grupului, inculpatul s-ar fi deplasat la un bancomat din Bălți, unde a extras suma de 8.000 de lei din contul victimei. În aceeași zi, folosind datele bancare obținute ilegal, acesta a efectuat achiziții frauduloase într-un magazin de electronice, cumpărnd trei telefoane mobile de ultimă generație, în valoare totală de 79.296 de lei. Prin hotărrea emisă de Judecătoria Bălți, inculpatul a fost găsit vinovat și condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare, într-un penitenciar de tip semiînchis. Instanța a mai dispus și confiscarea bunurilor dobndite prin mijloace frauduloase.

Moldova” ``` Șeful Inspectoratului General al Poliției, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, a acordat un interviu în exclusivitate Agenției Informaționale de Stat „MOLDPRES”. În cadrul acestuia, conducerea Poliției Naționale a vorbit despre campania „Nu te juca cu votul, că vei pierde totul”, protestele regizate de gruparea criminală Șor, miza Federației Ruse în alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie curent, tentativele de destabilizare, schemele de corupere electorală și implicarea reprezentanților cultelor religioase în campania electorală. MOLDPRES: Domnule Viorel Cernăuțeanu, Poliția Națională a lansat campania „Nu te juca cu votul, că vei pierde totul”, cu trei săptămni înainte de alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie. De ce este nevoie de o asemenea acțiune a oamenilor legii și ce obiective urmăriți? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Această campanie va cuprinde mai multe activități de informare și comunicare, mesaje și spoturi video. Poliția își dorește ca toți cetățenii să fie informați despre o ilegalitate sau despre un act care s-ar încadra într-o faptă ilegală. Ne dorim ca oamenii să perceapă această informație ca o formă de prevenire și să nu comită acțiuni ilegale. Prioritatea noastră este să comunicăm cu cetățenii, dar nu să sancționăm. Din aceste considerente, am recurs la această campanie amplă, prin care ne dorim să ajungem la ochii și urechile ctor mai mulți cetățeni. Acolo unde nu se va înțelege prin prevenire și comunicare, imediat vom recurge la următoarea etapă - de sancționare și documentare, fie contravențională, fie penală. De asemenea, vreau să menționez că această campanie, inclusiv mesajul care este amplasat pe unele instituții sau pe mijloacele de transport ale poliției, a fost avizat pozitiv de Comisia Electorală Centrală (CEC). Deci, toate mesajele, toate spoturile, tot ce vizează această campanie nu apare în spațiu public pnă nu avem avizul CEC, pentru a fi și noi siguri că nu există loc de interpretare în cazul acestor acțiuni. În cadrul campaniei, mai multe mesaje audio vor fi incluse în anumite locații cu o concentrație masivă de cetățeni, vor fi împărțite pliante informative, inclusiv în localitățile rurale, cum ar fi la primărie, poștă sau în alte locații. Totodată, vor fi repartizate anumite bunuri care vor conține acest mesaj. Textul va putea fi găsit și pe unele facturi de plată. În acest mod, cetățeanul va fi atenționat despre riscul corupției electorale și consecințele existente în cazul în care își vinde votul. În același timp, am discutat și cu operatorii de telefonie mobilă ca să transmitem acest mesaj informativ și prin SMS-uri. Îndemnul va fi distribuit și pe rețelele de socializare, la radio-uri și TV. Avem deja și cteva spot-uri video realizate, care vor fi difuzate în cadrul acestei campanii. Sperăm ca aceste acțiuni să-și facă efectul și un număr ct mai mare de cetățeni să fie informați. MOLDPRES: Federația Rusă ar fi planificat să investească cel puțin 100 de milioane de dolari pentru a cumpăra voturi și a deturna rezultatele alegerilor parlamentare, a anunțat recent președinta Maia Sandu, după ultima ședință a Consiliului Suprem de Securitate. Alte voci spun că resursele planificate de Moscova pentru a deturna rezultatele alegerilor din Republica Moldova ar fi de cteva ori mai mari. Ce date are poliția? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Vreau să vă prezint o analiză comparativă, ca să înțelegeți unele elemente. Doar în luna septembrie, înainte de alegerile prezidențiale din anul 2024, am documentat 39 milioane de dolari care erau transmiși prin intermediul sistemului bancar din Federația Rusă pentru procurarea voturilor. Atunci, la acea etapă, pentru cumpărarea unui vot se transmitea estimativ în jur de 5 000 de ruble rusești. În scrutinul parlamentar din acest an, tendința pentru procurarea sau coruperea unui cetățean este de 15 000 de ruble rusești. Deci, vedem că suma s-a triplat. Vreau să menționez că, atunci cnd ne referim la suma de 100 de milioane, trebuie să înțelegem că e vorba doar de un segment îngust din toată această schemă largă care urmărește procurarea voturilor. Dacă ne axăm pe alte aspecte - există confecționarea pliantelor și ziarelor pentru care se cheltuie bani nu pentru corupere electorală, dar pentru dezinformare. Noi deținem miile de numere de telefoane care lucrează în call-centrele lor, unde este o altă formă de finanțare. Deci, în afară de cele 100 de milioane, vedem că se alocă și aici bani pentru salarii, care sunt mult mai mari, nicidecum nu vorbim de doar 15 000 de ruble. De asemenea, aceștia au mai multe departamente: de securitate, logistic, departamentul IT, unde finanțările și plățile de întreținere a întregii caracatițe sunt mult mai mari. Trebuie să cunoaștem că suma de 100 de milioane de dolari este doar a treia parte din suma investită de Federația Rusă și exponenții săi în procesul electoral din Republica Moldova. Coruperea alegătorului în ziua scrutinului este o chestie consumată. Aceasta rămne în concepția trecutului, pnă în anii 2022. Începnd cu 2022-2023, a fost schimbat mecanismul. Am văzut și în alegerile de anul trecut că nu s-a vorbit direct cu cetățenii că iată vă oferim această sumă de bani, votați în acest mod. O mare parte din plăți s-au făcut la sfrșitul lunii august, începutul lunii septembrie. De asemenea, unii cetățeni au fost asigurați că vor primi banii după alegeri, ca să nu existe premisa ca un candidat să fie exclus din cursa electorală. Trebuie să înțelegem un simplu aspect: această piramidă care funcționează în interesul Federației Ruse, nu lucrează pentru un partid – cum ar fi cele asociate lui Ilan Șor sau pentru alte formațiuni, aceasta va lucra exact în sarcina și la indicațiile care vor veni de la Moscova. Anume acest lucru l-am văzut și în alegerile prezidențiale din 2024, cnd s-a schimbat orientarea către anumite personaje, în interesul Federației Ruse, prin intermediul pionului Șor. Aceeași tendință se va menține și în alegerile parlamentare, vor ghida către persoana de interes, care poate fi în continuare coordonatorul proceselor de aici în interesul Rusiei. MOLDPRES: Cum reușesc aceste resurse financiare să intre în Republica Moldova, prin ce canale? Ce mecanisme de detectare și blocare are Poliția? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Aplicația PSB sau sistemul bancar al Federației Ruse PSB în continuare este valabil, doar că transferurile nu se mai realizează doar pe cardul virtual al cetățeanului. Acum mecanismul este puțin mai sofisticat. Toate aceste date nu mai vin pe telefonul mobil, dar se utilizează aplicația Taito, descărcată din Telegram, care este utilizată pentru a vedea viramentul financiar al plăților care îi vin persoanei. Acești bani parcurg cțiva pași - din rubla rusească în crypto, din crypto în dolar și din dolar ajung virați în lei deja către cetățean fie pe card, fie cash. Anume aceste aspecte au fost documentate în ultimele perioade, inclusiv perchezițiile din ultimele zile. Persoanele care au fost reținute sunt o parte din cetățenii care asigură acest proces de lichefiere și de transmitere a banilor către electorat. Cu părere de rău, nici Taito, nici Telegram nu au reacționat la solicitările noastre legate de acest proces. Avem mecanismele noastre și cetățenii trebuie să înțeleagă că cei din Federația Rusă și interpușii care organizează acest proces i-au pus într-o situație proastă pe cetățeni, întruct toate procesele sunt documentate. Dacă cineva crede că acea tranzacție făcută prin mediul virtual nu poate fi documentată se înșală amarnic, deoarece orice tranzacție lasă urme și poate fi stabilită. Putem afirma cu siguranță că miza celor care urmăresc coruperea și influențarea decizii electorale în Republica Moldova nu este mai mică dect cea care a fost în anul trecut la alegerile prezidențiale. De asemenea, s-au pus accente foarte mari și s-a intensificat într-un pas galopant aspectul legat de dezinformare. Deci, anul trecut aveam o avalanșă mare de corupere electorală, iar dezinformarea cumva era pe locul doi. Acum, intenția de corupere a rămas aceeași, iar dezinformarea a trecut pe primul loc. Vedem cum sunt răspndite pe larg formele de dezinformare: că se înrolează cetățeni pentru a pleca la război, că va fi război, că minorii din familiile sărace se transportă în străinătate pentru prelevarea organelor. Deci, vedem multă dezinformare și forme de inducere în eroare a cetățenilor, care iau amploare și ajung la turații foarte și foarte mari. Aceste informații sunt distribuite pe rețelele de socializare și sunt făcute inclusiv prin inteligența artificială. În topul platformelor pe care sunt distribuite aceste informații se află TikTok-ul, unde se regăsesc cele mai multe video-uri și canale cu forme de dezinformare, iar peste 80% din acestea sunt create prin inteligența artificială. TikTok-ul este urmat de Telegramul și Facebook. Cu cei de la Facebook încercăm să colaborăm prin sistemul de comunicare și schimbul de date cu meta ca să asigurăm respectarea anumitor reguli. Este un proces anevoios, dar nu este imposibil. Cu TikTok-ul, acum o săptămnă, a fost instituit un punct focal, care garantează un contact cu poliția. Avem garanția că vom avea deschiderea pentru a lucra ct mai rapid și ct mai eficient, deoarece pnă acum am avut un intermediar care asigura acest proces și cumva se tergiversau lucrurile, dar atunci cnd vorbim de dezinformare acest lucru trebuie să se întmple în perioade foarte scurte și nu în zile sau săptămni, căci aceste video-uri acumulează sute de mii de vizualizări într-un timp record. MOLDPRES: În ultimele zile, organele de forță au desfășurat zeci de percheziții într-o cauză penală inițiată pentru corupere electorală, finanțare ilegală a partidelor politice și spălare de bani. În urma descinderilor, mai multe persoane au fost reținute. Acestea ar fi acționat în beneficiul unei organizații criminale ghidate din afara țării, cu scopul coruperii alegătorilor. Ne puteți oferi detalii despre schemele utilizate de grupare și despre persoanele aflate în vizorul poliției pentru organizarea acestor acțiuni? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Sunt persoane care asigură anumite scopuri și interese legate de finanțare și corupere electorală, ceea ce este important să nu admitem acum în Republica Moldova. Cetățenii sunt din diferite regiuni ale țării. Există foarte multe acțiuni aflate în desfășurare, de aceea mizăm și pe sprijinul cetățenilor care, dacă vor comunica poliției despre faptul că au fost atrași în această schemă ilegală, vor fi scutiți de răspundere. În cadrul operațiunilor recente au fost ridicate sume de bani pentru coruperea electorală – cumpărarea directă a voturilor. La unii subiecți am văzut transferuri de sute de mii de ruble, la alții am văzut chiar și un milion de ruble transferate, în funcție de rolul care îl are în contextul desfășurării procesului electoral și asigurării coruperii alegătorilor. Cu referire la aspectele de corupere, de finanțare și cele legate de intenții de organizare a dezordinilor pe teritoriului Republicii Moldova în procesul electoral, instituțiile statului au luat anumite măsuri chiar la începutul anului curent, mă refer la procese de documentare. Persoanele implicate au rămas în mare parte aceleași. Totuși, o parte din liderii raionali, care au fost implicați în acțiuni ilegale în cadrul alegerilor din toamna anului trecut, acum sunt subiecți ai', summary='Date: 2025-09-08 | Source: MOLDPRES | Legal Status: Alleged | The head of the Moldovan General Police Inspectorate, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, alleged that the Russian Federation invested at least $100 million in efforts to corrupt voters and influence the parliamentary elections in Moldova. He detailed that $39 million was documented in September 2024 alone as being transferred through the Russian banking system to buy votes, with the amount paid per vote tripling from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 Russian rubles since the 2024 presidential elections. The funds are part of a broader scheme involving disinformation campaigns, call centers, and logistical support, with the $100 million representing only about one-third of the total Russian investment in electoral interference.

[Ioana Andreescu](https://stirileprotv.ro/autor/ioana-andreescu/) Ministerul venezuelean al Securității Publice a declarat într-un comunicat pe Instagram că influencerul Gabriel Jesús Sarmiento a murit în orașul Maracay, potrivit [CNN.](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/americas/venezuelan-influencer-sarmiento-tiktok-shot-dead-intl-latam) Gabriel Sarmiento critica frecvent grupurile criminale și presupusa corupție din rndul forțelor de ordine prin conținutul său online, iar ministerul a adăugat că moartea sa a survenit la scurt timp după ce acesta raportase „amenințări venite din partea membrilor GEDOs (Grupuri Structurate de Crimă Organizată) și a unor polițiști presupus implicați”. Maracay este capitala regiunii Aragua, regiune de unde își trage numele faimoasa bandă Tren de Aragua, deși nu există o legătură cunoscută între moartea influencerului și această grupare criminală. CNN a încercat să ia legătura cu poliția din Aragua pentru comentarii. Citește și [Un ofițer de informații ucrainean a fost împușcat în plină zi la Kiev.

Într-o înregistrare a livestreamului lui Gabriel Sarmiento văzută de CNN, se aude o femeie țipnd din afara cadrului, în timp ce un bărbat o întreabă de ce strigă. „Ce s-a întmplat, ce s-a întmplat?” strigă bărbatul în înregistrare, urmat de o rafală puternică de focuri de armă. „M-au împușcat!” strigă apoi bărbatul. Videoclipul se încheie cu imaginea a doi bărbați înarmați, neidentificați. Cteva secunde mai trziu, livestreamul se oprește, iar videoclipul se termină.

Articolul de față, bazat pe investigațiile extinse ale ziarului Incisiv de Prahova, dezvăluie o rețea de corupție, spălare de bani și posibile legături mafiote care operează sub aparența respectării normelor de mediu. Garda de Mediu Prahova și Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Prahova sunt acuzate de o indiferență șocantă față de sănătatea publică, tolernd ani de zile funcționarea unei rețele care se sustrage controlului statului. Marile companii din industriile extractive, petroliere și de rafinare scapă nepedepsite, iar agențiile de mediu par complet lipsite de putere sau voință în fața acestor abuzuri flagrante. **Conexiuni politice suspecte și un monopol periculos** Legătura dintre Sterileco și figuri influente din politică, inclusiv fostul ministru Radu Oprea, creează o atmosferă de impunitate. Suspiciunile de favoritism politic și implicarea în afaceri obscure sunt extrem de grave. Un raport al Consiliului Concurenței din 2021 confirmă poziția dominantă a Sterileco pe piață (peste 40% cotă de piață), obținută prin achiziționarea unor concurenți precum Mondeco, Pro Air Clean Ecological și Demeco, toate controlate, în trecut, de aceiași asociați ai Stericycle Romnia (actuala Sterileco). Această fuziune ascunde, probabil, o strategie de eliminare a concurenței și consolidarea unui monopol ilegal. **Mărturii șocante și dovezi ale ilegalității** Multiple sesizări, inclusiv cele ale lui Oprișan Marius Danut, descriu nereguli alarmante: diferențe enorme între cantitățile colectate și cele incinerate, deșeuri aruncate direct la groapă din cauza utilajelor defecte, lipsa cntăririi deșeurilor, nerespectarea proceselor de sterilizare și incinerare, precum și aruncarea medicamentelor expirate la gropile de gunoi. Aceste practici, semnalate încă din 2016, pun în pericol sănătatea publică și mediul înconjurător. **Sancțiuni derizorii și o anchetă necesară** Deși Garda Națională de Mediu a aplicat o amendă de 300.000 lei și a anunțat sesizarea organelor de cercetare penală, măsurile par insuficiente și întrziate. Întrebarea care se impune este dacă intervenția unor figuri politice, precum Radu Oprea, a influențat această lentoare în reacția autorităților. Dosare penale pentru fals, vnzare de ambalaje neconforme și adrese false sunt în curs de investigare la București. Ziarul Incisiv de Prahova va continua să dezvăluie implicarea managerilor de spitale și a polițiștilor complici în această rețea criminală. **Primul caz: Spitalul de Boli Infecțioase „Sf. Parascheva” din Iași** Spitalul Clinic de Boli Infecțioase „Sf. Parascheva” din Iași, condus de Florin Roșu, a semnat un contract suspect cu Sterileco. În ciuda aparențelor legale, deșeurile medicale nu sunt procesate corespunzător, ci aruncate în gropi de gunoi din jurul Bucureștiului, din cauza utilajelor defecte ale Sterileco. Contractul, în valoare de 9.681 lei/pachet de deșeuri, este o dovadă a faptului că Sterileco, prin achiziționarea concurenților, controlează licitațiile și impune prețuri exorbitante. Această situație reprezintă o amenințare directă la adresa sănătății publice, cu riscul răspndirii de boli infecțioase. Mărturii ale angajaților Sterileco confirmă aruncarea ilegală a deșeurilor medicale, inclusiv medicamente expirate, în gropi de gunoi, ignornd complet reglementările legale. **Concluzie: O luptă pentru sănătate publică și justiție** Scandalul Sterileco dezvăluie un sistem corupt și ineficient în gestionarea deșeurilor. Este nevoie de o anchetă temeinică, tragerea la răspundere a celor vinovați și o reformă urgentă a sistemului de gestionare a deșeurilor pentru a proteja sănătatea publică și mediul. Ziarul Incisiv de Prahova va continua să investigheze acest caz și să informeze publicul despre evoluțiile situației. Vom reveni.

Publicat acum 10 ore pe noiembrie 6, 2025 De [Incisiv](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/author/incisiv/ \"Articole de Incisiv\") Cnd impostura își dă întlnire cu sinecura, iar disprețul față de romnii din străinătate devine sport național, nu e de mirare că scandalul ajunge pnă în Palatul Parlamentului. Ceea ce ziarul nostru, **Incisiv de Prahova**, a dezvăluit în premieră la jumătatea lunii octombrie a anului trecut, a sărit acum gardul și a aterizat direct pe pupitrele deputaților, transformndu-se într-un rechizitoriu parlamentar fără perdea. Doamna Ramona Lovin, deputat AUR, nu s-a mai abținut și a tras un semnal de alarmă care ar trebui să zdruncine din temelii Ministerul Afacerilor Externe, instituție mult prea des confuză între diplomație și circ de provincie. **„Sirena din Strehaia” și curtea ei de lachei: De la „Feng Shui” la facturile umflate, pe banii noștri! [(aici)](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/10/12/sirena-din-strehaia-si-curtea-ei-de-lachei-cum-se-sifoneaza-banii-publici-cu-zambetul-pe-buze-in-cetatea-eterna/)** Vă mai amintiți de Gabriela Dancău, „Excelența Sa” ambasadoarea Romniei în Italia, poreclită de crcotași „Sirena din Strehaia”? Era cea care, conform investigațiilor **Incisiv de Prahova** (12 octombrie 2025), transforma întlnirile cu oamenii de afaceri în ședințe de partid pentru „yesmeni” și cosmetiza realitatea ca o veritabilă „Madam Ceaușescu”. Ei bine, „Feng Shui-ul diplomatic” al „Excelenței Sale” a ajuns acum în atenția Parlamentului. Deputata Ramona Lovin a reiterat acuzațiile grave legate de sifonarea banilor publici, dar și de traseul spectaculos al soțului-pădurar, detașat de la Romsilva și angajat, „coincidență fericită”, șef administrativ la Centrul Cultural de la Roma. Un „accident” care a costat, iar acum e pe agenda publică! Nu mai puțin scandalos este episodul în care, înaintea misiunii din Italia, „Excelența Sa” a concediat abuziv funcționari consulari „pe taxe de urgență”, lăsnd romni din diaspora în stradă. Statul romn, adică noi, contribuabilii, a fost nevoit să despăgubească victimele, plătind TVA-ul local pentru achizițiile misiunii. O afacere profitabilă pentru „Excelența Sa”, o pagubă pentru bugetul public. Iar întrebarea, reluată acum și în Parlament, rămne: de unde are ambasadoarea bani pentru a-și trimite odrasla la cele mai exclusiviste colegii din Elveția, dacă nu cumva din „șpăgile toscane” și alte aranjamente dubioase? Ilegalitățile legate de detașarea lui Barbacsu, transformat din pădurar în „expert” plimbat pe bani mulți, nu au făcut dect să completeze tabloul corupției și al pilelor, un tablou pe care doamna Lovin l-a expus fără menajamente în plen. **Bordeaux, feuda „consulului” uitat de Romnia: O comedie (neagră) cu romni invizibili [(aici)](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/10/16/bordeaux-feuda-unui-consul-uitat-de-romania-o-satira-amara-despre-diplomatia-de-fatada/)** De la Roma, ne mutăm în Bordeaux, unde Ministerul de Externe pare să fi uitat că are datoria de a reprezenta Romnia, nu doar interesele personale ale unor anonimi cu titluri pompoase. Așa cum **Incisiv de Prahova** relata pe 16 octombrie 2025, **funcția de consul onorific s-a transformat, în cazul lui Michel Beylot, într-un hobby costisitor și o sinecură personală. Un personaj care nu vorbește limba romnă, nu are legături cu cultura țării, dar organizează „festivități pentru uz intern” unde romnii activi sunt invizibili, în timp ce „romnii de complezență” aplaudă o mascaradă.** Acest circ diplomatic, care discreditează imaginea Romniei în ochii partenerilor francezi, a fost de asemenea punctat de deputata Ramona Lovin. Ea a subliniat cum astfel de situații demonstrează un „dispreț față de romnii din străinătate” și o lipsă totală de responsabilitate. Ct va mai tolera Romnia aceste „consulate” fantomă, conduse de personaje fără anvergură, al căror singur merit pare să fie menținerea unor privilegii într-un sistem anchilozat? **Interpelarea-șoc: „Ministerul de Externe – între impostură, sinecuri și dispreț față de romnii din străinătate”** Sub acest titlu, care spune totul, deputata Ramona Lovin a aruncat mănușa în ringul politic. Interpelarea sa nu este doar o simplă formalitate, ci o strigare disperată a romnilor din diaspora, care s-au săturat să fie reprezentați de „impostori”. Faptul că angajați în consulate sunt „rude cu ambasadorii” și că există „consuli care nu vorbesc limba romnă” este, pentru mulți, o palmă dată identității naționale și un semn clar că în Ministerul de Externe, meritocrația este un concept extraterestru. Este timpul ca Parlamentul să meargă dincolo de simple interpelări și să ceară socoteală. Este timpul ca „Sirenele” și „Consulii” de carton să fie demascați și trimiși acolo unde le este locul, nu în ambasade, ci, poate, în paginile unor viitoare volume de fabule absurde. Pentru că, în cele din urmă, factura pentru acest circ o plătim tot noi. ***Iar rsul amar al romnilor din străinătate începe să se transforme într-o furie pe care niciun „Feng Shui” diplomatic nu o va putea calma. Vom reveni.*** (Cristina T.).

Emil Pascu, liderul sindical, a dezvăluit date parțiale aferente anului 2024, venind în replică la „minciunile” propagate în spațiul public conform cărora personalul din sistemul de apărare și ordine publică nu ar contribui proporțional cu salariile lor, în comparație cu angajații din alte sectoare, care plătesc contribuții sociale precum CAS. **Cine contribuie cu adevărat? Cifrele vorbesc** Deși recunoaște că „încă nu am primit răspunsuri de la toate unitățile”, Sindicatul Diamantul a oferit o serie de cifre impresionante, ce contrazic narativul public. Conform datelor parțiale obținute de Sindicatul Diamantul, peste un miliard de lei (echivalentul a peste 205 milioane de euro) au fost vărsați deja la bugetul de stat în 2024, provenind de la diverse structuri din cadrul Ministerului Afacerilor Interne (MAI) și unitățile subordonate. Printre contribuțiile individuale semnificative se numără: * **Inspectoratul General pentru Situații de Urgenţă (IGSU) și unitățile subordonate:** 790.130.292 lei (aproximativ 158.832.902 €) * **Ministerul Afacerilor Interne (doar Aparatul Central):** 69.266.275 lei (aproximativ 13.924.088 €) * **Inspectoratul Judeţean de Poliție Prahova:** 45.602.380 lei (aproximativ 9.167.014 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Olt:** 39.528.343 lei (aproximativ 7.945.989 €) * **Inspectoratul General pentru Imigrări (aparat central și unități din subordine):** 34.402.484 lei (aproximativ 6.915.659 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Tulcea:** 19.041.958 lei (aproximativ 3.827.855 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Bistrița-Năsăud:** 18.519.684 lei (aproximativ 3.722.909 €) * **Casa de Pensii Sectorială a M.A.I.:** 3.017.403 lei (aproximativ 606.564 €) * **Şcoala de Agenți de Poliție “Septimiu Mureșan” Cluj-Napoca:** 2.426.410 lei (aproximativ 487.758 €) * **Centrul de Formare şi Perfecţionare a Poliţiştilor “Nicolae Golescu” Slatina:** 1.896.363 lei (aproximativ 381.216 €) Totalul parțial al acestor contribuții se ridică la suma impresionantă de **1.023.831.592 lei**, echivalentul a aproximativ **205.811.843 euro**. **Opacitatea MAI: Refuzul contabilului sef și acuzațiile de ipocrizie** Contrastnd cu deschiderea Inspectoratului General pentru Situații de Urgență (IGSU), care a furnizat fără probleme cifra totală pentru unitățile subordonate, Ministerul Afacerilor Interne, prin Direcția Generală Financiară, a refuzat să ofere suma integrală a contribuțiilor individuale. Emil Pascu de la Sindicatul Diamantul a acuzat direct pe Grecu, contabilul șef al direcției, pentru acest refuz, catalogndu-l drept un obstacol deliberat. „Am cerut MAI să ne dea direct întreaga sumă vărsată cu titlu de CIBS, în anul 2024, de către toate unitățile ministerului. Am fi putut să vă punem la dispoziție, toată suma care s-ar fi dovedit uriașă! Însă bineînțeles că Grecu, contabilul șef al Direcției Generale Financiare, a refuzat!” a declarat Emil Pascu, citat de Sindicatul Diamantul. Liderul sindical a subliniat și ipocrizia situației, arătnd că același oficial „profită la maxim de toate drepturile polițiștilor (este «chestor», are salariu de «excelență», va avea drept la pensie militară, etc), deși este doar un contabil asimilat polițiștilor, în timp ce va pune bețe în roate ori de cte ori are prilejul!”, conform acuzațiilor făcute de Emil Pascu de la Sindicatul Diamantul. **Transparența, un drept: Apel la schimbare** Dezvăluirile Sindicatului Diamantul aduc în prim-plan nu doar sumele impresionante contribuite de personalul MAI, ci și necesitatea', summary='Date: 2024-09 | Source: IncisivdePrahova.ro | Legal Status: Ongoing/Alleged | Article alleges a corrupt criminal network operating under the guise of medical waste recycling by SC Sterileco SRL, involving money laundering suspicions and links to organized crime.

Dosarul de insolvență 3418/105/2023, depus la Tribunalul Prahova pe 9 august 2023, dezvăluie o rețea diverisificata spre a înșela și a prejudicia intenționat creditori și victime. În spatele acestei escrocherii stau personaje cu diverese motivații, toate consolidnd o schemă de fraudă bine pusă la punct. **Unele personaje cheie și modul lor de operare** Vlad Nichita, cunoscut ca „Il Capo”, a fost figura centrală în elaborarea acestei operațiuni. În cadrul biroului său de avocatură, alături de colaboratoarea sa, **av. Marinescu Denisa-Roxana**, au fost întocmite documente false și scheme de înșelăciune. În perioada în care Vlad Nichita se afla în stare de reținere preventivă la Cmpina, **av. Marinescu Denisa-Roxana** a încercat să-i „mngie” pe victimele prejudiciate, contactndu-le telefonic și chiar întlnindu-se personal cu unele dintre ele, încercnd să le convingă să retragă plngerile penale împotriva lui Vlad Nichita, invocnd lipsa implicării acestuia în vnzarea unor apartamente multiple de către PFA Lupu Marioara-Domnica, reprezentată de mama dezvoltatorului „din umbră”, Mihai Lupu. **Tabele de creditori – o păcăleală ordonată** ***Un aspect extrem de interesant îl reprezintă modul în care „Il Capo” întocmește tabelul creditorilor „doamnei Marioara”. În listă nu se află niciun pagubit căruia să nu-i fi fost restituit apartamentul sau apartamentele, însă pe lista acestor credite apar două firme controlate direct de “Il Capo”. Este vorba despre SC Fasty Tasty SRL, unde fiind administrator soția sa, Elena Nichita, și despre SC Lomina Invest SRL, avnd sediul în aceeași clădire, situată pe Strada Poligonului nr. 1. Canonizat drept controversat și urmărit att internațional, Lorenz Michael Nasturica, cunoscut ca „Nash”, este prezentat ca fiind proprietarul real al acestei firme, actnd sub influența și cu complicitatea directă a „Il Capo”.*** **O rețea de firme și manipulări financiare** Dorim să evidențiem cteva elemente: SC Lomina Invest SRL, cu cod fiscal Ro 46370443, are sediul în aceeași clădire ca și Fasty Tasty SRL, iar administratorul acesteia, Lorenz Michael Nasturica, s-a remarcat printr-un trecut plin de evaziune și furturi de autoturisme de lux în Germania, ulterior vndute în Romnia. Acest personaj, cunoscut pentru atitudinea sa de escroc din copilărie, a încercat să-și inducă în eroare partenerii și victimele, pretinznd a fi un investitor de succes în imobiliare, bursa sau criptomonede. Stilul său de viață opulent a fost menit să impresioneze și să cștige încrederea celor din anturaj. **Legături de o ambianță de mafie și conspirație** [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/06/reteaua-de-coruptie-din-ploiesti-se-prabuseste-epicentrul-controversei-e-mai-aproape-de-destramare-iar-scanteile-ultimei-riposte-pot-aprinde-un-altceva/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/05/confirmarea-oficiala-a-anchetelor-dezvaluirile-incisiv-de-prahova-dezvaluie-o-retea-de-coruptie-monumentala-in-ploiesti-cu-implicarea-politiei-justitiei-si-a-unor-personaje-cheie-precum-pseudo-ju/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/24/justitia-sub-atac-inculpatul-pseudo-jurnalist-spagar-si-santajist-stavri-catalin-in-centrul-unei-controverse-legate-de-abuzurile-procurorilor/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/14/vlad-nichita-intre-coruptie-si-evaziune-o-noua-faza-a-scandalului-white-tower/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/07/vlad-nichita-scapa-nicolae-alina-georgeta-ramane-sub-control-judiciar-semne-de-intrebare-in-justitie-ii/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/04/vlad-nichita-scaparea-de-sub-controlul-justitiei-o-poveste-de-coruptie-si-escrocherie/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/03/vlah-nichita-tupeul-unui-infractor-in-fata-justitiei/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/02/21/instanta-refuza-sa-cada-in-plasa-lui-vlad-nichita-contestatia-la-controlul-judiciar-a-fost-respinsa/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/01/09/retelele-de-coruptie-si-escrocheriile-imobiliare-vlad-nichita-si-conexiunile-sale/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/07/avocatul-vlad-nichita-pariaza-pe-ridicarea-sechestrului-asigurator-in-scandalul-white-tower-cu-bani-si-influenta-poti-face-orisice-in-republica-ploiesti/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/20/ploiestiul-orasul-sfidarii-si-al-coruptiei-de-la-stalpi-montati-la-masini-pe-trotuar-o-noua-faza-a-scandalului-white-tower/) etc. Relatiile dintre Mihai Lupu, Lorenz Nasturica și alți apropiați sunt întipărite de o legătură strnsă de „frățietate”, implicnd acte de corupție, escrocherii și manipulare. Conexiunea cu Vlad Nichita a fost facilitată de Mihai Lupu, care a fost prins în schema de fraudare a creditorilor, costndu-i milioane de lei, astfel înct acest grup să induce în eroare și să destabilizeze complet activitatea societăților implicate. **Fuga în Dubai și planuri de evadare** ## **Ce e și mai grav?** **Toți acești mafioți au creat un cerc vicios:** activează în ilegalitate, manipulează actele, fuzionează firmele și ascund milioanele furate în conturi off-shore, în timp ce sistemul judiciar preferă să închidă ochii. Ei au transformat justiția într-un simplu teatru de păpuși, unde hotărrile sunt dictate de interese obscure și de protecție mafioților în fața legii. **Furtul, falsificarile și delapidarea sunt doar începutul.** În spatele acestor scheme, se află o rețea bine închegată, plină de impostori, învățată să lucreze ca un mecanism perfect pentru a jefui statul și cetățenii deopotrivă. ## **Victimele? S-au transformat în numere, în statistici!** Dar adevărata tragedie e că acești criminali au distrus viețile multor oameni nevinovați. Păgubiți de apartamente, de bani, de speranțe? Nu, ei sunt acum niște simple cifre în bilanțul unor escroci care învrt banii, în timp ce sistemul se face că plouă. **Dacă justiția ar fi funcționat cu adevărat, acești infractori nu ar fi avut libertate cțiva ani în urmă.** Dar, în loc de a-i trimite după gratii, sistemul regionalizat i-a protejat și i-a ajutat să fugă, să ascundă banii și să controleze zona de la mare distanță. **În același timp, a orchestrat jocuri de înșelăciune de proporții, viznd ticăloși și oameni de afaceri, pe care i-a manipulat cu zecile de milioane de lei. În perioada 2021-2024, în Romnia, Lorenz Nasturica a fost protagonistul uneia dintre cele mai mari scheme financiare, o rețea intenționat creată pentru a juva și a păcăli pe oricine i se ivea în cale.** *Stilul său de viață—opulent, ostentativ, de lux—nu era altceva dect o mască menită să atragă victimele. Cu ceasuri Rolex, mașini de lux, haine de firmă, a dat iluzia unui „succes nemărginit”, dar adevărul e că totul a fost o păcăleală ordonată și criminală*. ### **Relații periculoase și colaborări la limita legii: Lupu, Lorenz și Vlad** Lorenz Nasturica nu a fost singur în această poveste de coșmar. În cercurile influenților, se leagă prietenii și alianțe periculoase. Împreună cu Mihai Lupu și Vlad Nichita, a format o triadă criminală de proporții, în care înșelătoria, delapidarea și manipularea au fost la ordinea zilei. *Lupu, pentru a-și masca adevărata origine a banilor, și-a construit o imagine de „afacerist de succes”, dar în realitate totul s-a bazat pe fraude, evaziune și scheme de escrocherii. Iar Lorenz, subtil și viclean, a fost piesa de rezistență—fugit în Dubai cu milionare, lăsnd în urmă un dezastru de păgubiți!* ### **„Fraierii” plătesc, iar sistemul se face că nu vede** De ce nu se face nimic? Pentru că justiția în Romnia nu prea are curajul sau voința să pună mna frecvent pe toți acești iresponsabili. Numele lor apar peste tot: în acte false, în declarații mincinoase, în balbe contabile trucate. Totul pentru a-i menține pe ei în libertate și a împiedica victimele să-și recupereze banii și drepturile. *Creditele sunt armele lor: în loc să recupereze, se implică în toate schemele de delapidare, umflnd bilanțuri și falsificnd bilanțurile contabile, iar sistemul le acoperă, de teamă sau de interese obscure.* **Lorenz Nasturica, fugind în Emirate, continuă să orchestreze scheme și dincolo de granițe**, doar pentru a-și proteja averea furată. Iar victimele, în marea lor majoritate, rămn cu speranța că, într-o zi, adevărul va ieși la lumină și acești criminali vor plăti pentru faptele lor. ## **Ce trebuie să se întmple ACUM?** *Rețeaua criminală trebuie desființată urgent! Sistemul piramidal de înșelăciune trebuie să fie demascat, trăgnd la răspundere pe toți cei implicați, de la mafioți de buzunar, la funcționari corupți și judecători complici.* *Victimele nu mai pot aștepta! Se cere o anchetă serioasă, respunsuri concrete și confiscarea activelor furate.* ### **Dreptatea trebuie să triumfe!** *Acest sistem corupt, în care mafie, politicieni și avocați în comun fură milioane și distrug vieți, trebuie să fie demolat din temelii. Nu mai e loc de scuze: criminalii trebuie să răspundă!* **Aceasta e realitatea cruntă: o mafie financiar-penală de proporții, o organizație de șarlatani, escroci și trădători ai sistemului! Ei trebuie aduși din nou în fața justiției, unde le e locul!** ## **Și de ce se întmplă toate acestea?** Pentru că, din păcate, **justiția este o păpușă**, iar cei care trebuie să o apere au devenit beneficiari ai acestei mafii. Sistemul a fost coruptizat în anii trecuti, iar adevărul este ascuns sub cantități enorme de dosare trucate, acte false și declarații mincinoase. **Victimele acestui jaf brutal nu vor răbdare!** Ei trebuie să vadă răspunsul sistemului în cel mai scurt timp, pentru ca adevărul să răsară și pentru ca acestor hoți să le fie luată tot ce au furat — fără milă, fără compromisuri. ## **PUNCT: Romnia trebuie să se trezească!** Pentru ca acești criminali să plătească, trebuie să-i scoatem în fața legii și să facem adevărata luptă cu mafia imobiliară. **Soborul furăciunii trebuie demascat, pricinuit răspunderea și confiscate toate averile furate.** **Dreptatea nu a fost făcută încă, dar vom fi la îndemna justiției dacă, cu toții, vom fi mai vigilenți, mai uniți și mai hotărți să nu îi lăsăm să ne fure viitorul!** ***Aceasta e realitatea: o țară în urgentă criză morală, în care mafia a devenit sistemul, iar sistemul, mafie! Vom reveni.** (Cristina T.).* ***Precizări:*** Legea 190 din 2018, la articolul 7, menţionează că activitatea jurnalistică este exonerată de la unele prevederi ale Regulamentului GDPR, dacă se păstrează un echilibru între libertatea de exprimare şi protecţia datelor cu caracter personal.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: 2023-03-08 | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290) | Legal Status: Ongoing sanctions enforcement | Lukoil is listed among major Russian oil companies sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under OFAC authorities as part of measures related to the conflict in Ukraine.

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

Specifically, Eduard Benderskiy, a former FSB officer and father-in-law of Evil Corp leader Maksim Yakubets, was sanctioned for materially assisting Evil Corp and acting on behalf of the Russian government. Benderskiy’s private security firm provided security services for Lukoil facilities in Iraq around 2017. OFAC designated Benderskiy and his companies Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to Executive Orders 14024 and 13694 for supporting Evil Corp activities. While no direct allegations or investigations of Lukoil itself for financial crimes, AML deficiencies, or sanctions violations are stated, the involvement of a security firm linked to Lukoil’s operations with a sanctioned individual raises potential reputational and compliance risks. No charges, fines, or enforcement actions against Lukoil were reported. No information on Lukoil’s AML program or compliance measures provided.

Pleads Guilty to International Bribery Scheme ================================================================================= Thursday, August 22, 2024 **For Immediate Release** Office of Public Affairs A former energy trader pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to bribe Mexican government officials to secure contracts for his then-employer, Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S.affiliate of the largest independent energy trading firm in the world. According to court documents, Javier Aguilar, 50, of Houston, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PEMEX Procurement International, Inc. (PPI), a wholly owned affiliate of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), in exchange for assistance in winning business for Vitol. “Javier Aguilar has now admitted that he bribed foreign officials to win business when he worked as an oil and gas trader at Vitol Inc., using shell companies, fake contracts, sham invoices, and alias email accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Aguilar’s guilty plea yesterday follows his conviction at trial on related charges earlier this year. His illegal conduct netted Vitol hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, and now he will pay the price.” “With yesterday\\'s guilty plea, the defendant admits his role in the widespread corruption of the international commodities market and to casting aside laws and rules that apply to all to unfairly line the pockets of the few,” said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. “The actions of the defendant and his co-conspirators, and of those who act similarly, destroy people’s faith in their governments, disadvantage those who play by the rules, undermine confidence in American businesses worldwide, and will not be tolerated by this Office or our law enforcement partners.” “The Southern District of Texas is ground zero in the fight against foreign bribery and corruption in Latin America,” said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. “My office’s prosecutors — experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — will continue to bring to justice those who damage the integrity of Texas’s vital energy sector with illegal advantages fueled by greed. This guilty plea begins the process of repairing the damage caused by Aguilar as well as putting on notice those who might seek to emulate him and his cohorts.” “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been the law of the land, and enforceable worldwide, for decades. Yet unscrupulous businessmen still try to bribe their way to profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. “My message to them is that the charges and penalties you will face are not worth the gain. I want to commend the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Office of International Affairs; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas for their diligence pursuing this case, but especially the agents and analysts who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of FCPA violators.” Between 2017 and 2020, Aguilar, who was a trader in Vitol’s Houston office, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PPI to obtain numerous contracts for Vitol to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of ethane to PEMEX. To conceal the scheme, Aguilar and his co-conspirators used a series of fake contracts, sham invoices and shell entities incorporated in Curaçao and Mexico. The defendant and his co-conspirators also used alias email accounts to communicate about the scheme and code words, including “shoes,” “medicine,” “invitations,” and “coffee,” to describe the bribes. Aguilar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to a violation of the Travel Act. The FCPA conspiracy charge, which was brought by a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas, related to conduct that was initially charged in the Eastern District of New York. As part of his guilty plea, Aguilar consented to transfer the Texas case to New York, to consolidate the cases, and to forfeit $7,129,938. The plea follows Aguilar’s related [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-oil-and-gas-trader-convicted-role-foreign-bribery-and-money-laundering-scheme) at trial in February 2024 for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, violating the FCPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with schemes to bribe Ecuadorian and Mexican officials. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment on the money laundering offense and five years’ imprisonment on each of the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. In December 2020, Vitol [admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/vitol-inc-agrees-pay-over-135-million-resolve-foreign-bribery-case) to bribing officials in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S.Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York. As a part of the resolution, Vitol agreed to pay a combined $135 million in penalties as part of a coordinated resolution with the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and authorities in Brazil. Seven of the defendant’s co-conspirators have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing. These individuals have agreed to forfeit more than $63 million in connection with this and related schemes. FBI Miami’s International Corruption Squad investigated the case. Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan P. Lax, Matthew R. Galeotti, and Nick M. Axelrod for the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sherin Daniel and Deputy Chief Suzanne Elmilady for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The MLARS Special Financial Investigations Unit and Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance. The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at[www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa). The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to [kleptocracy@usdoj.gov](mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov)or[https://tips.fbi.gov/](https://tips.fbi.gov/).

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Hafeez](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/sahar-hafeez.html) [Samantha Franks](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/) Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-partnering-cross-agency-trade-fraud-task-force) the launch of a “cross-agency” Trade Fraud Task Force “to bring robust enforcement against importers and other parties who seek to defraud the United States.” According to DOJ, the Task Force will “augment the existing coordination mechanisms” within DOJ and leverage expertise from DOJ’s Civil and Criminal Divisions and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against any parties who seek to evade tariffs and other duties, as well as smugglers who seek to import prohibited goods into the American economy.” The Task Force announcement occurs against the backdrop of [intensified tariff activity](https://www.globaltradeandsanctionslaw.com/snapshot-of-current-tariff-actions-and-negotiations/), including reciprocal tariffs on nearly every trading partner, and [investigations on imports of critical materials](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/section-232-pharma-semiconductors-crit-minerals-trucks.html) from semiconductors to metals and minerals and pharmaceuticals under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. While statutes such as the False Claims Act (FCA) have occasionally predicated trade-related actions in the past, the Task Force represents a concerted effort by the U.S. government to bring greater resources, statutory authorities and prosecutorial power to bear on alleged customs violations. The Task Force is expected to promote coordination between DOJ and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to target evasion schemes, including false origin declarations, misclassification, fraudulent under-valuations and other alleged violations that undermine tariff policy and deprive the Government of tariff revenue. As discussed further below, this will likely include not only traditional CBP civil penalty enforcement but also civil *and* criminal actions under the FCA and statutes such as wire fraud, importing through false statements, and conspiracy. For importers, this dual pressure—policy expansion coupled with enforcement escalation—creates a complex compliance environment. While the announcement provides important information about how the Task Force will operate, importers and related businesses should stay attuned to the broader trade enforcement context and the open questions that remain in order to assess and mitigate their own risk. At the end of this piece we offer discrete recommendations, including audit and supply chain compliance that incorporates increased risk of DOJ involvement and FCA claims; internal and external reporting mechanisms for potential violations, from both companies and their competitors; and monitoring fast-moving legislative, judicial and regulatory developments that can impact import compliance. **How the Task Force Will Operate** On the personnel front, the Task Force will consist of litigators from the Criminal and Civil Divisions at DOJ. From the Criminal Division, the Task Force will include prosecutors from the Fraud Section’s newly established [Market, Government, and Consumer Fraud Unit](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/mgc-unit). Within the Civil Division, the announcement indicates the Task Force will be supported by members of the Commercial Litigation Branch’s Civil Fraud Section (which conducts False Claims Act enforcement) and National Courts Section (which has responsibility for civil customs fraud actions). According to the announcement, attorneys on the Task Force “will work closely with” investigators from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which are both part of DHS. As for strategy, DOJ’s announcement anchors the Task Force in the “America First Trade Policy” Presidential Memorandum (Jan. 20, 2025) and Executive Order 14243, “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos” (Mar. 20, 2025). According to DOJ, the Task Force will advance these policies by pursuing: (a) customs laws violations through duty and penalty collection actions under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Tariff Act”); (b) civil actions under the False Claims Act; and (c) parallel criminal prosecutions, penalties and seizures under Title 18’s trade fraud and conspiracy provisions. CBP enforces the civil penalty provisions of section 592 the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1592. Under the customs law, importers are held to a standard of reasonable care, which requires that importers exercise diligence to make accurate declarations regarding the classification, valuation, country of origin and applicable duty rates for imported merchandise. Section 1592(a) provides that “no person, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, may enter, introduce, or attempt to enter any merchandise” into U.S. commerce by means of a material misrepresentation or omission, or aid and abet such a violation. Where CBP has reasonable cause to believe an importer has violated section 1592, it may issue a written penalty notice seeking liquidated damages. Liquidated damages can range from a civil penalty of up to twice the duties owed (for negligence), to the full domestic value of the merchandise (for fraud)—though, after receiving a penalty notice, importers have the opportunity to seek mitigation of monetary penalties under the customs regulations, 19 C.F.R. Part 171. In addition to seeking civil monetary penalties under the Tariff Act, the Task Force announcement also reaffirms that DOJ will rely on other enforcement tools like the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729. The FCA has been called the government’s “[most powerful tool](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/March/159dag.htm)” for combatting fraud against the United States. Although the DOJ has not often used the FCA to bring trade fraud enforcement actions, the Ninth Circuit has [recently held](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/06/23/22-55063.pdf) that false claims can include not only fraudulent requests for payment but also evasion of obligations to pay customs duties otherwise owed to the government. And, in addition to per-violation civil penalties, the FCA authorizes courts to impose treble damages, which means that knowing violators could end up paying three times the amount of duties owed. Finally, a trade fraud investigation may implicate a number of criminal offenses in Title 18 of the United States Code, including sections 287 (criminal false claims), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 541 (false classification of goods), 542 (importing through false statements), 545 (smuggling), 1001 (false statements to government officials), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1349 (attempt and conspiracy to commit fraud), 1956 (money laundering), and 1957 (transactions in laundered funds). With the exception of sections 287 and 371, all of these offenses could give rise to criminal or civil forfeiture. That means, even absent a criminal conviction, DOJ could file a civil complaint, with a lower burden of proof, that seeks to forfeit the proceeds of trade fraud, a forfeiture money judgment in the same amount, or—in the case of money laundering—any property involved in a transaction with laundered funds. **The Broader Context** Prosecuting trade fraud is not new to DOJ. As the announcement recognizes, the Civil Division has resolved a number of trade prosecutions in 2025. Nor is the idea of a Trade Fraud Task Force new to the Department. As recently as March 2024, DOJ [praised](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ford-motor-company-agrees-pay-365m-settle-customs-civil-penalty-claims-relating) the work of a “Trade Fraud Task Force” in supporting a $365 million settlement with Ford Motor Company to resolve allegations that it violated the Tariff Act of 1930 by misclassifying and undervaluing hundreds of thousands of cargo vans imported from Turkey. Nonetheless, the 2025 version of the Task Force merits serious attention. First, DOJ has formally added the Criminal Division and HSI to the Task Force. The involvement of prosecutors and criminal investigators is likely to increase the number of trade fraud investigations, if not enforcement actions. Second, trade fraud prosecutions are being prioritized in a way they were not previously. That sends a message to agents and prosecutors that trade fraud cases are more likely to get leadership and press attention, which could incentivize working on Task Force matters instead of other investigations. Third, the Task Force announcement expressly encourages relators to alert the government to credible allegations of trade fraud by utilizing the FCA’s *qui* *tam* provisions to file sealed complaints on behalf of the United States. While *qui tam* complaints have long been an avenue for reporting fraud, the DOJ’s express receptiveness to reviewing and potentially acting on trade fraud complaints is new and likely to yield more such reports from an increasingly active relator-side bar. The addition of the Criminal Division to the Task Force is also significant. Trade penalties in the customs arena, including under the Tariff Act, have historically involved civil monetary penalties. Recent policy changes, however, increase the likelihood that trade fraud allegations and investigations develop into criminal prosecutions. In May 2025, the Division [expanded](http://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/140004) the scope of offenses that are eligible for its Corporate Whistleblower Awards Pilot Program to include corporate violations relating to trade, tariff and customs fraud. On September 16, 2025, the Criminal Division’s Acting Assistant Attorney General, Matthew R. Galeotti, [disclosed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-association) that, in the past four months, the Division received 313 whistleblower tips and that 120 of them—including tips relating to trade fraud—warranted further investigation. Also in May, the Division announced that it had [revised](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400031) its Corporate Enforcement Policy (CEP) to further encourage companies to voluntarily self-disclose misconduct—including misconduct relating to trade fraud. Under the revised CEP, absent aggravating circumstances, a company that voluntarily self-discloses, fully cooperates and remediates, and pays all forfeiture and restitution is *entitled* to a declination rather than a *presumption* of a declination. This is significant because the Tariff Act itself provides a mechanism for “prior disclosure,” which allows importers to disclose potential past violations to avoid more exacting monetary penalties. Accordingly, importers considering a prior disclosure to CBP should now also consult with counsel about making a voluntary self-disclosure under the Criminal Division’s CEP. **Unresolved Questions** Notwithstanding the information provided by DOJ about the new Task Force, a number of questions remain. The announcement did not include certain operational details, such as where within DOJ the Task Force will reside, who will lead its day-to-day work, or whether the Task Force will report on its activities beyond press releases describing individual cases. The announcement also did not indicate whether the Task Force will benefit from the allocation of any dedicated resources, whether agents or attorneys. A/AAG Galeotti did, however, recently [announce](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-global) that the Criminal Division would be “leading” DOJ’s effort to investigate and prosecute trade fraud, with a “particular focus” on cases involving (1) “long-running efforts to evade hundreds of millions in tariffs, including tariffs on Chinese products,” and (2) trade fraud schemes involving corporate executives. Some of the open questions may be answered through pending legislation. For example, legislators in the House’s Select Committee on the Chinese Community Party have reintroduced the bipartisan [Protecting American Industry and Labor from International Trade Crimes Act](https://mcusercontent.com/ffedde7e54b71a41a9505fff1/files/893afae6-3edc-b4f7-15a7-50a9afa42c35/HINSON_010_xml.pdf). Among other things, the Act would require the Criminal Division to establish a task force to prosecute trade crimes, and appropriate $20 million for the Division to hire and train prosecutors and investigators and conduct enforcement actions. Depending on the mix of attorneys, investigators and staff, this could result in the addition of as many as 50 to 60 personnel to the Task Force, and the more dedicated resources that are assigned to the Task Force, the more enforcement activity that can be expected. Congress may influence trade fraud prosecutions in other ways. For example, the Chairman of China Select Committee recently sent a [letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/) asking the agency to investigate an importer over the evasion of steep tariffs on Chinese goods—highlighting that Congress has also turned its attention to issues such as misclassification or transshipment of merchandise. Other questions may be addressed by the Supreme Court. On November 5, the Court will hear the U.S. government’s appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision in *V.O.S. Selections v. Trump*, which held that the President lacked the authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose reciprocal tariffs and the so-called “fentanyl” tariffs. Even if the Supreme Court allows the lower court ruling invalidating these tariffs to stand, many tariffs will remain in place, including tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles under Section 232, tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 imposed on China during President Trump’s first term, and antidumping and countervailing', summary='Date: 2025-06-30 (approximate, based on article context) | Source: Global Trade & Sanctions Law (Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP) | Legal Status: No specific Lukoil-related allegations or investigations reported | Article discusses the launch of the U.S. DOJ’s new cross-agency Trade Fraud Task Force aimed at combating trade-related fraud, including customs violations, tariff evasion, and false claims under statutes such as the False Claims Act and criminal provisions in Title 18. The Task Force will coordinate enforcement actions involving DOJ Criminal and Civil Divisions, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements, the enforcement of them, and circumstances where they do not apply. This guidance is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct you to further detailed guidance to read alongside it. This document is current on the date of publication. 1. Prohibitions and requirements --------------------------------- The regulations impose financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging Russia to cease actions which destabilise Ukraine, or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. The prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons include British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas. The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 10 of the regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters. It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions. If you are unclear about any aspect of the regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice. Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the regulations are set out below. 1.1 Non-government controlled territory of Ukraine --------------------------------------------------- The territorial scope of certain measures in the regulations is ‘non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’. This is defined in regulation 2 as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts’. ‘Crimea’ is further defined as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. 1.2 Designation of persons --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of the financial and/or director disqualification and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions if they are, or have been, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in [regulation 6 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6)). The regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the purposes of the financial and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) provides details of the people designated under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated. 1.3 Specification of ships --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may specify a ship for the purposes of shipping sanctions if the ship is, has been, or is likely to be, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 57F of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)). The regulations also provide that the Secretary of State must specify a ship by its International Maritime Organization number or, where it is not reasonably practicable to identify it by that number, by any other means that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list)provides details of the ships specified under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been specified. #### The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations 2024 These [regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/made) came into force on 31 July 2024. They amend regulation 57F (specification of ships) so that a ship may be specified for any activity whose object or effect is to: * destabilise Ukraine or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine, or to * obtain a benefit from or support the Government of Russia This includes, but is not limited to, carrying military or dual-use goods from a third country to Russia, as well as oil or oil products that originated in Russia. Ships specified under Regulation 57F will be subject to ‘shipping sanctions’, namely measures in regulations 57A to 57E. Where shipping sanctions apply, a specified ship: * is prohibited from entering a port in the UK * may be given a movement or a port entry direction * can be detained, and * will be refused permission to register on the UK Ship Register or have its existing registration terminated These regulations also amend regulation 6 (designation criteria) to include additional activities for which a person may designated, namely: * providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology to persons involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia (as defined in the Regulations); and * owning or controlling directly or indirectly, or working as a director, trustee, other manager or equivalent of a person, other than an individual, involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine The former expands the criteria under the Regulations to designate entities, including foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions on behalf of, or in support of, specified sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. This in line with G7 commitments to further curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system which Russia is using to facilitate its war in Ukraine. An [explanatory memorandum](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/memorandum/contents) accompanies the regulations, providing further information on their provisions. 1.4 Financial sanctions ------------------------ #### Asset freeze and making available provisions The regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly. These prohibitions also apply in relation to entities owned or controlled by a designated person. The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is the authority for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury. OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. See more information about [how OFSI implements financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-financial-sanctions-guidance). #### Other financial and investment restrictions The regulations prohibit a person from directly or', summary='Date: 2025-07-22 | Source: GOV.UK | Article discusses UK government statutory guidance on Russia sanctions, including financial sanctions enforcement, licensing, and compliance requirements.

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

With an eye on future trends, this week we lead by exploring Web3, the catch-all term for the vision of a new internet which at its core uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. For some it represents a transition from big corporations controlling and monetising content on the internet to individuals sharing content and interacting through decentralised networks. But for others, the notion of a decentralised internet presents many challenges, especially how to identify, prosecute, and prevent financial crime on the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets are inextricably linked to the concept of Web3, so we also deliver the latest news surrounding the world of virtual currencies and renewed efforts by authorities to detect and prevent crime in the sector. In addition, we feature updates on global sanctions, cover the growing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, present you with the most recent reports, legislation & guides, and finally wrap up this week’s Roundup by reviewing the latest news from the world of money laundering. ### **What exactly is Web3?** Web3 isn’t yet fully in existence, so nobody knows exactly how it will work. But most concepts involve the blockchain, an unchangeable ledger system used by cryptocurrencies to keep track of transactions. Some believe that [Web3](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/web3-definition-internet.html) is little more than a rebranding exercise for crypto, others believe it’s a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet, in which every activity and social interaction can be bought and sold. ### **Can a blockchain-based decentralised internet change the world?** The appeal of the blockchain for Web3 supporters is that it logs everything in a way that is transparent and impossible to edit or falsify; each new transaction creates a “block” in the ledger anyone can see. The main issue of the blockchain is the same as its supposed benefit, as nobody can edit the ledger, and anyone can create as many crypto accounts as they want, it’s hard to [address and protect against fraud](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-web3-5271876). ### **Webinar: Experts Take on FinCrime: Web3 and Digital Assets** While Web3 and digital assets have the potential to benefit society, cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols are a central tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. At this upcoming [webinar](https://www.napier.ai/post/web3-financial-risk-compliance) (Wednesday, September 21st, 2022 @ 9:30 am BST) experts from law enforcement and technology vendors will discuss the digital asset ecosystem as it relates to financial crime. ### **Helium: an example of Web3 in action today** [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is a crowdsourced wireless network that rewards users with cryptocurrency for sharing their home network connections. This effectively creates a large network of hotspots that users can access, while the owners of those hotspots can receive compensation in the form of crypto tokens. ### **Crawley Town Football club: The “transformative sports success story of Web 3.0”** While traditional finance was used in the initial purchase of Crawley Town football club, its owners are now harnessing [digital currencies to build a remote community of fans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62136553). In July, Crawley launched their own NFT and for the price of 0.35 Ether (worth £353 at the time of publication) buyers received ‘a virtual season ticket’. ## Money Laundering, Fraud & Corruption ### **Malta-based bank fined for anti-money laundering breaches** A Malta-based bank owned by a Dutch billionaire has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for some [major shortcomings in its anti-money laundering processes](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/bank-owned-dutch-billionaire-fined-antimoney-laundering-breaches.978758). Novum Bank, owned by Dutch entrepreneur Marcel Boekhoorn, was hit with an €89,000 fine and ordered to tighten up its checks on clients. ### **Opinion: call for a European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime** The increasing complexity of EU financial and anti-financial crime regulation has made it increasingly difficult for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) to keep up with regulatory developments. This has led to growing calls for the establishment of a [European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/need-european-centre-excellence-antimoney-laundering-compliance.979691) to provide training and guidance, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. ### **Report: The biggest money laundering risks must be given top priority** De Nederlandsche Bank has published a [report on preventing and combating financial crime](https://www.dnb.nl/en/general-news/2022/biggest-money-laundering-risks-must-be-given-top-priority/). Entitled ‘From recovery to balance’, it argues for more risk-based customer due diligence and recommends focussing on the high-risk customer categories. ### **Money laundering through Payment Gateways and Buy Now Pay Later schemes** The Covid-19 pandemic threw India’s economy into chaos and Chinese scammers took advantage by flooding the market with legitimate-looking micro-loan and betting apps, which they turned out to be scandalous and robbed thousands of users of their money. Many companies are now facing scrutiny as their [due-diligence methods failed](https://regtechtimes.com/money-laundering-through-payment-gateway/) to prevent transactions with fraudulent merchants. ### **Regulator details “Frankly shocking” AML breaches at Sydney casino** Star Entertainment Group, Australia’s second biggest operator, has been found unfit to hold a casino licence in Sydney. An inquiry by Australia’s New South Wales state gambling regulator into alleged [breaches of anti-money laundering laws and criminal infiltration](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-state-regulator-says-star-unfit-hold-casino-licence-2022-09-13/), identified “systemic governance, risk and cultural failures”. ### **Webinar: Money laundering through the property sector: Headline cases in review** While the property sector has faced increasingly stringent anti-money laundering regulations across the globe, often these regulations are poorly enforced. Public records can go a long way toward flagging and investigating suspicious real estate transactions, particularly when records are centralised, networked, and searchable. Join this webinar on September 28 at 1pm ET for a discussion on money laundering in the real estate market and examples of how to trace nefarious actors’ real estate assets in Sayari Graph. ## Legislation, Regulation and Sustainability ### **Report: FATF and INTERPOL intensify global asset recovery** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and INTERPOL have launched a [joint initiative](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/methodsandtrends/documents/fatf-interpol-2022.html) to increase global efforts to recover illicit assets. While asset recovery is key to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, it is estimated that countries intercept and recover less than one per cent of global illicit financial flows. ### **FATF Report: Japan strengthens measures to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing** Since the 2021 assessment, Japan has taken several actions to strengthen its framework. As a result, the FATF has [re-rated the country](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fur-japan-2022.html) on Recommendation 2 from Partially Compliant to Largely Compliant. Japan is now compliant on 4 Recommendations, largely compliant on 25, and partially compliant on 9 Recommendations.

Speaking at The Financial Crime Summit, Sarah Pritchard warned that financial crime would worsen in light of the cost-of-living crisis and advised firms to plan how they will respond to the increased risks. “My message to all firms is this: embed your financial crime checks in your systems from day one, but keep evolving as the threats evolve,” she said. “Use the power of data and tech, and stay alert for situations in which you may need to recalibrate your defences and alerts.” Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets, FCA ### **Quick Guide: Money laundering through the gambling industry** The Basel Institute on Governance has published a quick [guide](https://baselgovernance.org/publications/quick-guide-28-money-laundering-through-gambling-industry) which sets out how criminals abuse the gambling industry to launder illicit funds. It includes case studies to illustrate the different ways criminals launder money in casinos, online gambling websites, bars and clubs, as well as physical and online sports betting services.

Her dismissal came after she warned the company it was [overstating its sustainable investment credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8TzL5-pSYo). While DWS has always denied Fixler’s allegations, her public statements have sparked official investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. “This whole saga culminating in this police raid, is the wake-up call for the ESG market.

По данным ФБР, Семёнов, являясь экспертом в области блокчейн-технологий, использовал свои навыки для разработки криптовалютного миксера Tornado Cash. Сервис, изначально позиционировавшийся как инструмент для обеспечения анонимности транзакций, на практике превратился в крупный механизм по отмыванию денег. Через [Tornado Cash](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=Tornado+Cash) было отмыто более 1 миллиарда долларов преступных доходов. Как предполагает ФБР, в апреле и мае 2022 года сервис Tornado Cash предположительно использовался Lazarus Group, северокорейской организацией по киберпреступности, находящейся под санкциями, для отмывания сотен миллионов долларов доходов. Семенов и его сообщники якобы знали, что сервис Tornado Cash, которым они управляли, участвовал в этих нарушающих санкции транзакциях. Они якобы продолжали управлять сервисом и способствовать проведению сотен миллионов долларов, помогая Lazarus Group переводить преступные доходы с криптовалютного кошелька, который был обозначен Управлением по контролю за иностранными активами как заблокированное имущество. 21 августа 2023 года федеральный суд США выдал ордер на арест Семёнова. Ему предъявлены обвинения в сговоре с целью отмывания денег, ведении нелицензированного бизнеса по переводу денежных средств и нарушении Закона о международных чрезвычайных экономических полномочиях. В настоящее время местонахождение Семёнова неизвестно: он может находиться в России, Турции или Объединенных Арабских Эмиратах — в этих странах у него есть установленные связи. В объявлении о розыске его описывают как белого мужчину с каштановыми/коричневыми волосами и зелеными глазами, хотя не исключается, что он мог изменить внешность. Всех, у кого есть информация о местонахождении Семенова, ФБР просит [связаться с ними](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) или с ближайшим американским посольством. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/08/24/tornado-cash-fbi/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Article discusses Lukoil but contains no financial crime or compliance information.', hyde_score=0.36),\n",

Решение вынес судья Бранислав Лекович. По заявлению защиты, залог должен был быть выплачен наличными, и деньги поступили от невесты подсудимого Озмен. Защита приложила справки с места её работы, дохода и остатка на банковском счёте. Однако, рассмотрев представленные доказательства и заявления, суд пришёл к выводу о несоблюдении законного требования об установлении залога, поскольку не было представлено ни действительного письменного согласия поручителя, ни доказательств того, что указанная сумма была фактически предоставлена \\u200b\\u200bсуду. Судья Лекович посчитал, что предложенный залог не даёт достаточных гарантий того, что ответчик не покинет Черногорию и не будет препятствовать производству по делу. – Суд считает, что предложенный залог не гарантирует, что обвиняемый не скроется, учитывая тяжесть преступления и объем подозрительных финансовых операций, – говорится в мотивировочной части решения. Адвокат подсудимого предложил освободить его подзащитного из-под стражи с возможным применением к нему мер пресечения, таких как запрет на выезд из Черногории и изъятие паспорта. Однако суд счёл, что обстоятельства дела не изменились по сравнению с предыдущими решениями о продлении срока содержания под стражей. В решении Высшего суда также говорится, что это уже третье ходатайство защиты с просьбой об освобождении подсудимого под залог, которое, как и предыдущее, было отклонено как необоснованное. Он купил лимузины и квартиры в Подгорице. Согласно обвинительному заключению СДТ, подозреваемый приобретал роскошные автомобили и недвижимость в Подгорице с 2023 по начало 2025 года, выдавая деньги неизвестного происхождения за законное приобретение. В обвинительном заключении указано, что покупки были совершены наличными и включали в себя автомобили класса люкс и квартиры в столице. Обвинение утверждает, что этими действиями обвиняемый пытался легализовать денежные средства, полученные незаконным путём. Обвиняемый находится под стражей, в отношении него за рубежом ведутся другие уголовные дела по аналогичным преступлениям. Суд напомнил, что Озмен обвиняется в совершении тяжкого преступления, связанного с отмыванием денег в течение длительного времени, которое карается тюремным заключением сроком на несколько лет, что еще больше увеличивает риск побега. Специальная государственная прокуратура предъявила обвинение гражданину Турции по подозрению в отмывании денег, полученных преступным путём на территории Черногории в течение длительного периода. Прокуратура обвиняет его в приобретении автомобилей класса люкс и недвижимости на территории Черногории в 2023 и 2024 годах за счёт средств, законное происхождение которых ему не было доказано. Согласно обвинительному заключению, Озмен несколько раз совершал сделки с наличными, приобретая такие автомобили, как Lamborghini Aventador, Mercedes AMG G63, Porsche Cayenne и Range Rover Velar, на общую сумму более 700 000 евро. Кроме того, он приобрёл несколько квартир в Подгорице на общую сумму более миллиона евро, при этом он якобы «ложно указал происхождение денег». В ходе обыска квартиры и автомобиля обвиняемого полиция обнаружила крупную сумму наличных денег, ценные часы Rolex, ювелирные изделия, несколько ноутбуков, а также документацию, связанную с куплей-продажей недвижимости и транспортных средств. Судебно-медицинская экспертиза выявила следы кокаина на нескольких банкнотах, обнаруженных обвиняемым. Согласно обвинительному заключению, Озмен отрицал, что получил деньги преступным путём, утверждая, что заработал их на видеороликах в социальной сети YouTube и занял часть средств у друзей. Однако отчёты полицейского управления и таможенных органов свидетельствуют о том, что в документах отсутствуют данные о легальном ввозе в страну более крупных сумм. Судебное слушание по этому обвинению еще не назначено, а в Турции против Озмена уже ведется судебное разбирательство по подозрению в организации незаконных азартных игр и отмывании денег. Обвиняемый находится в следственном изоляторе Спуж с 28 января. https://www.dan.co.me/vijesti/hronika/sud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003 [![Image 1: Sud odbio jemstvo državljaninu Turske osumnjičenom za pranje novca: Vjerenica nudila 700.000 eura za slobodu](https://external.fagc3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/8999273576366829258?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dan.co.me%2Fimages%2Fslike%2Fnew%2F2025%2F10%2F30%2F2006653.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=co.me&stp=c0.5000x0.5000f_dst-jpg_flffffff_p1000x522_q75_tt6&_nc_gid=U5lYJp51jSZCg8xNcVr_Ng&_nc_oc=AdmxFR6t991tX4wwTTjhOaW1pY0xbBNvuWFjFGKdUbOOPWyfP2qctUSRzoTkAYFIgqI&ccb=13-1&oh=06_Q3-4AceN-kRqHx6CT5ozPFkyZaIfUGkvNPyAl1eWM8-vU9m5&oe=690E9723&_nc_sid=d86115)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dan.co.me%2Fvijesti%2Fhronika%2Fsud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003&h=AT19CBvbMHry-Fvb1pXW_HnUEYIgeRIUltOMD9fZ2YsP2l0Gf9D8nx74ZBS1YKt6qdjTEKIvW35nFsbOrLu68Y6vYUCfW9T5RgVlJW1lV0npwZAytZMd7NESUTdfAVUagUP6cIsuw6OQSpv4F2ongO5i1Q&__tn__=H-R&c[0]=AT0-zeE629v1lSS0VVVZu49nx99XVjGa2oYmuZUHAXMqcANof1HfYTp95BG6NUBgnqrfKoxJ-aHfaaGmdmM50Xw4MqLtUinX2ERMClVRAC8kNw9K2m49J3EFi6wQt7d3cyQmO7GiJ1cxjD7ZFXbxXHX9UWTZQj-eVAOIyVQ3JV4TPSXVI4E5W39V9h6OxMAV3BfrxnORGiHvcdLr_HwVMn2yvIMu5VrHqQw) [dan.co.me Sud odbio jemstvo državljaninu Turske osumnjičenom za pranje novca: Vjerenica nudila 700.000 eura za slobodu Viši sud u Podgorici odbio je predlog odbrane turskog državljanina Erkana Ozmena, osumnjičenog za produženo krivično djelo pranje novca, da bude pušten iz pritvora uz jemstvo od 700.000 eura.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dan.co.me%2Fvijesti%2Fhronika%2Fsud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003&h=AT19CBvbMHry-Fvb1pXW_HnUEYIgeRIUltOMD9fZ2YsP2l0Gf9D8nx74ZBS1YKt6qdjTEKIvW35nFsbOrLu68Y6vYUCfW9T5RgVlJW1lV0npwZAytZMd7NESUTdfAVUagUP6cIsuw6OQSpv4F2ongO5i1Q&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0-zeE629v1lSS0VVVZu49nx99XVjGa2oYmuZUHAXMqcANof1HfYTp95BG6NUBgnqrfKoxJ-aHfaaGmdmM50Xw4MqLtUinX2ERMClVRAC8kNw9K2m49J3EFi6wQt7d3cyQmO7GiJ1cxjD7ZFXbxXHX9UWTZQj-eVAOIyVQ3JV4TPSXVI4E5W39V9h6OxMAV3BfrxnORGiHvcdLr_HwVMn2yvIMu5VrHqQw) ![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/85d8b181a20aeb64a3afc2f1c39d2480) All reactions: 4 Like Comment Share See more on Facebook See more on Facebook Email or phone number Password Log In [Forgot password?](https://www.facebook.com/recover/initiate?ars=royal_blue_bar) or Create new account', summary='Date: 2024-10-30 | Source: dan.co.me | Legal Status: Ongoing | Turkish citizen Erkan Ozmen is under criminal investigation and detention in Montenegro for prolonged money laundering offenses from 2023 to early 2025.

Police found large amounts of cash, luxury watches, jewelry, laptops, and transaction documents during searches. Forensic analysis detected cocaine traces on some banknotes. Ozmen denies illicit origins, claiming income from YouTube videos and loans from friends, but customs and police reports show no legal import records for large sums. He faces related criminal proceedings in Turkey for illegal gambling and money laundering.

на 1,7 млрд долларов.** Согласно [информации](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/seven-members-moscow-based-criminal-organization-plead-guilty-over-17-billion) Офиса прокурора США в Восточном округе Нью-Йорка, семь членов организованной преступной группировки, находящейся в Москве, признаны виновными в схеме по организации масштабной международной схемы мошенничества в сфере медицины и отмывании денег: они выставили поддельные счета более 50 аптекам на сумму свыше 1,7 миллиардов долларов. Сообщники действовали по всей стране, включая Нью-Йорк, Бруклин, Лонг-Айленд, Статен-Айленд, Нью-Джерси, Техас и др. Лидер группы, гражданин США Брайн Саттон, 31 год, находящийся в Москве, управлял преступной деятельностью из российской столицы, он остается на свободе. Среди обвиняемых значатся: Хафизула Эбади, Джошуа Мануэль Алегрия, Дэвид Гэри Бишофф, Брайсен Кей Миллетт, Дела Сайдазим, Энтони Сантамария и Хершель Цикман, они признали себя виновными. Ответчики участвовали в международной схеме по приобретению аптек по всей территории Соединенных Штатов, имея ранее существовавшие отношения с частными компаниями медицинского страхования. Эти аптеки вместе с колл-центрами использовались, чтобы побудить людей принимать ненужные лекарства, для чего выписывались мошеннические рецепты в аптеках схемы — на этом сеть нанятых врачей и обвиняемые заработали более 1,7 миллиарда долларов. Обвинения против Саттона и других были объявлены 7 ноября 2023 года. Следствие выяснило, что преступная группа выставила мошеннические счета в период с 2017 по 2022 год. Сообщники Саттона обеспечивали поиск аптек, врачей и открытие колл-центров, первые из которых открылись в штате Юта, а вскоре сеть расширилась в другие страны, включая Россию. Сотрудники колл-центров звонили клиентам с предложением купить лекарства по низкой цене без предварительного медобследования. Практикующие медсестры и помощники врачей выписывали рецепты после телемедицинских консультаций, зачастую обманывая врачей о проведении этих визитов, которые фактически не осуществлялись. Рецепты оформлялись на имена врачей и номера их идентификаторов, в результате чего многие бенефициары так и не получили обещанные медикаменты. Для отмывания денег мошенники использовали подставные компании, а также вымышленные персональные данные и средства связи. В преступной группе работали IT-специалисты, которые настраивали программное обеспечение для управления аптечной сетью. Они подготавливали и подавали заявки на возмещение «расходов» в частные страховые компании. В итоге преступникам удалось получить от страховых компаний свыше $500 миллионов. Сроки тюремного заключения, которые грозят членам преступной группы, варьируются от 10 до 30 лет, в то время как некоторым простоит конфискация имущества и штрафы в размере от 1,8 до 520 миллионов долларов. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/10/29/members-of-moscow-criminal-organization-guilty/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Legal Status: No financial crime or compliance information found | Article and website content reviewed contain no information related to money laundering allegations, AML deficiencies, sanctions violations, fraud, corruption, or compliance actions involving Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.4),\n",

Об этом [сообщается на сайте](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0225) американского Минфина. Ведомство называет Grinex наследницей закрывшейся российской криптобиржи Garantex, которая, по его данным, «напрямую содействовала» киберпреступникам и обработала с 2019 года трансакции, связанные с незаконной деятельностью, на более чем $100 миллионов. Минфин США внес Garantex в санкционный список в апреле 2022 года. Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex, как утверждает ведомство, для уклонения от ограничительных мер. Garantex, основанная в 2019 году в Эстонии и ведущая деятельность в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, по данным Минфина США, обслуживала даркнет-рынки и группы операторов программ-вымогателей, включая Conti, LockBit и Ryuk. В феврале 2022 года компания Garantex лишилась эстонской лицензии на предоставление услуг в сфере цифровых активов после того, как подразделение финансовой разведки Эстонии выявило критические нарушения в системе противодействия отмыванию денег и финансированию терроризма (AML/CFT) и обнаружило связи между Garantex и кошельками, используемыми для преступной деятельности. В марте 2025 года американские и европейские правоохранители заблокировали домен Garantex и заморозили $26 миллионов, после чего клиенты и активы были переведены на новую площадку — Grinex. В пресс-релизе Минфина США подчеркивается, что Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex специально «для обхода санкций». Кроме того, под санкции Минфина США попали трое руководителей Garantex — ее сооснователь Сергей Менделеев, коммерческий директор Александр Мира Серда и региональный директор Павел Каравацкий — и шесть компаний из России и Кыргызстана, которые, как заявило ведомство, «поддерживали участие биржи во вредоносной кибердеятельности». Это кыргызстанская Old Vector, а также российские A7, A71 и A7 Agent, участвовавшие в выпуске рублевого стейблкоина A7A5. Его, по версии Управления по контролю за иностранными активами Министерства финансов США, Garantex использовала для перевода средств клиентам и обхода ограничений. Кроме того, под американские санкции попали проекты InDeFi Bank и Exved.

Garantex lost its Estonian license in February 2022 due to critical AML violations. In March 2025, U.S. and European authorities blocked Garantex’s domain and froze $26 million in assets, after which customers and assets were moved to Grinex, allegedly created by former Garantex employees to evade sanctions. The Treasury also sanctioned three Garantex executives and six companies supporting illicit activities. The sanctions include accusations of using a ruble stablecoin (A7A5) to circumvent restrictions. The article mentions U.S. sanctions against Lukoil but provides no details on financial crimes, AML violations, or compliance issues related to Lukoil itself.\\n\\nDate: 2023-10-10 | Source: 24.kg (implied from related links) | Legal Status: Alleged | U.S. sanctions announced against Lukoil (alongside Rosneft) for unspecified reasons related to sanctions enforcement.

Согласно [обвинительному заключению,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25029923-cryptonator-complaint) Пикулев и его соучастники управляли Cryptonator с 2014 года до марта 2023 года. Платформа осуществляла международную схему отмывания денег, предоставляя услуги преимущественно преступникам. Cryptonator принимала средства, полученные в результате многочисленных компьютерных взломов, атак с использованием программ-вымогателей, мошенничества и кражи личных данных, пишет [Securitylab](https://www.securitylab.ru/news/550792.php). Cryptonator никогда не регистрировалась в американской Сети по борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями (FinCEN), что является федеральным преступлением. В Министерстве юстиции утверждают, что платформа не имела значимых процессов по противодействию отмыванию денег и эффективной программы контроля. Пикулев осознавал, что обрабатываемые им средства были получены преступным путём или предназначены для поддержки преступной деятельности. Киберпреступники использовали платформу для обмена криптовалютой и вывода средств в фиатную валюту. Пикулев внедрил в Cryptonator функции, которые анонимизировали источник средств. В официальных документах Пикулев также использовал псевдоним «BOSS». Он управлял платформой через множество IT-провайдеров из США и размещал рекламу в американских соцсетях для продвижения сервиса. Также следователи получили ордер на обыск электронного адреса, использованного Пикулевым для регистрации cryptonator.com. Всего платформа обработала более 4 миллионов транзакций на сумму $1,4 миллиарда, при этом Пикулев получал небольшой процент с каждой транзакции. По [данным](https://www.trmlabs.com/post/us-and-german-authorities-seize-crypto-wallet-cryptonator-and-charge-administrator) TRM Labs, информация показывает многочисленные транзакции и связи Cryptonator с другими преступными рынками – Blender, Hydra Market, Bitzlato, Garantex и т.д. Биткойн-адреса, контролируемые Cryptonator, напрямую и косвенно отправили или получили: * более $25 млн. с даркнет-маркетов или мошеннических магазинов; * более $34,5 млн. с адресов мошенников; * более $80 млн. с высокорисковых бирж; * более $8 млн. с адресов, связанных с группами вымогателей; * более $54 млн. с адресов, связанных с кражей криптовалют в результате взломов; * более $34 млн. с криптомиксеров; * более $71 млн. с адресов, находящимися под санкциями. Пикулев использовал удостоверения личности и документы разных стран для регистрации сайтов и электронных адресов. Министерство юстиции не ответило на запросы о местонахождении Пикулева и о том, был ли он задержан.

The platform never registered with FinCEN, violating U.S. AML regulations, and lacked effective AML controls and suspicious transaction monitoring. Pikulev reportedly implemented features to anonymize the source of funds and used multiple identities and IT providers to operate the service.

Об этом [пишет](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chen-zhi-scam-singapore-police-b2859031.html) Independent. В середине октября 2025 года прокуратура США предъявила предпринимателю обвинения в сговоре с целью мошенничества с использованием электронных средств связи и в сговоре с целью отмывания денег. Как следует из обвинительного заключения, жертвами злоумышленников под эгидой Prince Holding Group стали 250 человек на территории США. В рамках расследования американские власти изъяли биткоинов более чем на $14 млрд. Одновременно власти Великобритании объявили об аресте в Северном Лондоне особняка стоимостью $15,6 млн и офисного здания за $130 млн. Правительства США и Великобритании также ввели совместные санкции против Чжи и его компании. [Российского криптомошенника Пичугина депортируют из Камбоджи](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/68a599ce9a79470187bbf88f) [Общество](https://www.rbc.ru/society/) Затем к расследованию присоединился Сингапур. Местные силовики арестовали финансовые активы Чэня на $114 млн, а также несколько яхт с коллекцией дорогостоящего алкоголя. Четвертого ноября тайваньская прокуратура задержала по делу Чэня 25 подозреваемых и конфисковала у камбоджийского бизнесмена активы на сумму $150 млн. В тот же день полиция Гонконга объявила об изъятии активов Чэня Чжи в виде наличных и акций еще на $353 млн. Prince Holding Group — камбоджийский конгломерат со штаб-квартирой в Пномпене и с дочерними компаниями в десятках стран. У холдинга интересы в разных сферах — недвижимость, финансы, авиация, туризм, логистика, высокие технологии и пищевая промышленность. [На сайте компании](https://www.princeholdinggroup.com/) указано, что она является одним из крупнейших конгломератов Камбоджи. 38-летний Чэнь Чжи, помимо камбоджийского паспорта, имеет гражданство Китая, где он родился. Как выяснило [Associated Press](http://www.ap.org/), Чэнь все еще [остается на свободе](https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-us-uk-online-scam-prince-chen-zhi-bbc3fae393003a16cda22efd5a2ada22). В случае признания его виновным в США ему грозит до 40 лет тюрьмы. Prince Holding Group ранее опровергала свою причастность к мошенническим операциям и публично не отреагировала на последние обвинения. В МВД Камбоджи заявили, что готовы сотрудничать со следователями других государств при наличии официального запроса, подтвержденного доказательствами. **Читайте РБК в [Telegram](https://t.me/+o--H2lU_IO83NmUy).** Поделиться Поделиться Вконтакте Одноклассники Telegram [РБК в MAX](https://max.ru/rbc) [На связи с проверенными новостями](https://max.ru/rbc) [Читайте РБК в MAX!

Свои предложения он опубликовал в [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid023LmPDPQUpAEQJtKNy6Ex6Lr6sPS3CorrgwMhZgBcurhmDddjmftJvpJ76urEi7obl&id=100075452118676&locale=ru_RU), сообщает [Orda.kz](orda.kz).** Марат Башимов рассказал, что направил письмо с предложениями генпрокурору Берику Асылову. Депутат хочет не просто вернуть государству выведенные за рубеж деньги, но и провести «расширенную конфискацию». По словам депутата, во многих странах учли рекомендации ФАТФ и внесли соответствующие изменения в законодательство. Раньше принять такие законы было невозможно из-за активного противостояния лоббистов, но сейчас это сделать необходимо, считает Башимов. Казахстан не полностью ратифицировал конвенцию ООН по борьбе с коррупцией, но всё равно является её участником — а это значит, что страна должна бороться с незаконным обогащением не только чиновников, но и членов их семей. > «Сейчас из-за того, что этой нормы нет, и активы переписаны на третьих лиц, многие уходят от ответственности, их имущество не конфискуется в полном объёме, а осуждённый «сидит» спокойно, зная, что у него не забрали то, что переписано на третьих лиц, родственников, любовниц и так далее. И этими активами и деньгами он завтра будет наслаждаться».Марат Башимов Мажилисмен указывает: в законодательстве есть понятие «имущество, приобретённое преступным путем». И оно относится в том числе к имуществу, которым владеют третьи лица. Например, члены семьи, сообщники по уголовным делам, аффилированные юрлица. Сюда же попадают активы, подаренные или за бесценок проданные «на сторону». > «При расширенной конфискации нет необходимости в отдельном судебном разбирательстве и вынесении обвинительного приговора в отношении предшествующей преступной деятельности, в результате которой предположительно были получены активы. Поскольку предполагаемая предшествующая преступная деятельность не нуждается в уточнении. Расширенную конфискацию можно применять лишь в отношении имущества, законность приобретения которого лицо объяснить не может. Механизм предлагается следующий: лицу, в отношении которого начато досудебное производство, предлагается доказать законность приобретения остального имущества. Если он не сможет доказать, то оно подлежит конфискации», — развивает свою мысль депутат. Марат Башимов уточнил, что расширенную конфискацию нужно применять не ко всем подряд — но в первую очередь под неё должны попадать отдельные категории госслужащих и политиков, а также те, кто работает на руководящих постах в госструктурах. Тем временем другие депутаты мажилиса, напротив, предложили [провести амнистию капиталов](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) — и простить казахстанским олигархам вывод денег из страны в обмен на их возвращение в родную экономику. **Читайте также:** * [Возврат активов: почему нельзя просто забрать элитную недвижимость казахстанцев в ОАЭ](https://orda.kz/vozvrat-aktivov-pochemu-nelzja-prosto-zabrat-jelitnuju-nedvizhimost-kazahstancev-v-oaje-399460/) * [Олигархи инвестируют 10,5 млрд долларов в экономику Казахстана](https://orda.kz/oligarhi-investirujut-105-mlrd-dollarov-v-jekonomiku-kazahstana-400481/) * [Понять и простить: казахстанским олигархам разрешат законно вернуть деньги в страну](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) [возврат активов](/tag/vozvrat-aktivov/) [казахстан](/tag/kazahstan/) [мажилис](/tag/mazhilis/) [марат башимов](/tag/marat-bashimov/) ## Лента новостей * [Токаев встретился с Госсекретарем США Марком Рубио и представителями администрации Дональда Трампа](/tokaev-vstretilsja-s-gossekretarem-ssha-markom-rubio-i-predstaviteljami-administracii-donalda-trampa-408811/) * [Что позволено женщине, то не позволено мужчине?

Его заподозрили в коррупции и отмывании денег, сообщает The Guardian, ссылаясь на документы федерального уголовного суда Швейцарии. Следствие, согласно документам, пытается установить происхождение состояния Абрамовича, которое он приобрел в России в 1990-х и 2000-х годах. Среди прочего власти острова в рамках расследования запросили данные о счетах в швейцарских банках, которые связывают с бизнесменом. Суд в Швейцарии, несмотря на попытки адвокатов Абрамовича заблокировать обмен документами, постановил, что эту информацию можно передать властям Джерси. Один запрос касается подозрений в отмывании денег, полученных Абрамовичем при продаже компании «Сибнефть» за 13 миллиардов долларов в 2005 году.

Это произошло вскоре после того, как власти Евросоюза и Великобритании ввели санкции против бизнесмена из-за полномасштабного вторжения войск России в Украину.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison». Dans le «lobby», beaucoup de gens parlent russe. «C’est un peu la nouvelle rue du Rhône en beaucoup plus moderne», estime un acteur du secteur qui, lui, est toujours\", summary='Date: 2023-11-21 | Source: Public Eye | Legal Status: No direct allegations or findings | Article reports that since Western sanctions and embargoes on Russian oil (effective December 2022 for crude and February 2023 for refined products), Dubai’s DMCC free zone has become a preferred hub for trading Russian oil, attracting many companies formerly operating from Switzerland.

C’est ce qu’a annoncé, par communiqué, la filiale de Sonatrach, sur sa page Facebook, jeudi dernier. Comparativement aux autres bien saisis, ces stations constituent un « menu fretin » de l’ensemble des biens publics détournés par les responsables communément désignés la « issa-ba ». Les plus importantes récupérations sont les « 30 milliards de dollars entre biens immobiliers, unités industrielles et sommes d'argent » annoncés par le président Abdelmadjid Tebboune lors de son dis-cours à la nation du 25 décembre 1923. Ce sont 350 entreprises, 15 000 ha de terrains, 12 000 logements, etc. C’est également l’usine de production d’acier de M’sila, récupérée et reversée à l’entreprise publique « Fondal » lors de la visite du Premier ministre, Sifi Ghrieb, au début de ce mois. C’est le complexe de production de matériaux de construction d’El Meniaâ. Une liste trop longue à énumérer dans cet espace. Ceci pour dire que la lutte contre la corruption se poursuit avec la même détermination depuis 2019. Dans une première phase, l’État s’était attelé à préparer les outils spécifiques nécessaires à la lutte. Il y a eu le cadre juridique avec la loi 22-08. Il y a eu la création de la Haute Autorité de transparence, de prévention et de lutte contre la corruption (HATPLC). Sans oublier les partenariats et conventions signés par l’Algérie avec les États et organismes étrangers. Bref, pendant ce temps, la justice suivait son cours, lent mais inexorable. Tout le monde a pu suivre les « ballets » incessants des convois entre les différentes prisons et les tribunaux devant lesquels ont été traduits les membres de la « Issaba ». Après les juge-ments définitifs des biens saisis, c’est le temps de la réintégra-tion comme nous l’avons vu plus haut. Si les avoirs bancaires récupérés sont reversés au Trésor public, les biens physiques comme les industries sont réintégrés dans le circuit écono-mique du pays. En les versant dans le patrimoine des entre-prises publiques. Ce qui sauve les emplois et participe à la création de richesses dans le pays. En marge de sa visite à M’sila, Sifi Ghrieb, a déclaré que « le Gouvernement est déter-miné à poursuivre la relance des projets confisqués dans le cadre de la lutte contre la corruption, car il s'agit de l'argent du peuple et les citoyens doivent pouvoir en profiter ». À Chlef, le 16 octobre dernier, il a inspecté le complexe spécia-lisé dans la fabrication des conserves de produits de la pêche saisi par la justice et intégré au groupe « AGRODIV ». Il a demandé aux responsables du groupe « d'accélérer le proces-sus de relance de cette unité industrielle…en vue de contri-buer à la création d'emplois dans la wilaya ». Le temps des « moissons » se poursuit. La lutte contre la corruption aussi. Avec la même détermination. On ne le dit pas assez !

LE MINISTRE FRANÇAIS DE L’INTÉRIEUR ESPÈRE RELANCER LE DIALOGUE AVEC L’ALGÉRIE P 2 LIRE EN PAGE 24 P 24 ACTUALITÉ 2 Lundi 20 octobre 2025 PÉKIN ACCUEILLE LA CONFÉRENCE DES FEMMES PARLEMENTAIRES AFRICAINES L’APN pour un partenariat au service de l’égalité et du développement inclusif L es travaux de la Conférence des femmes parlementaires africaines ont débuté hier à Pékin, réunissant des repré-sentantes de plusieurs pays du continent, dont une délégation algérienne. Cette rencontre, axée sur la coopération parle-mentaire et la promotion des droits des femmes, se poursuivra jusqu’au 28 octobre. Sous le thème ambitieux « Le renforcement de la coopération et de l’échange entre les institutions législa-tives, au service de la promotion des questions de la femme dans le monde », la Conférence des femmes parlemen-taires africaines s’est ouverte, dimanche, dans la capitale chinoise Pékin. L’événe-ment, qui s’inscrit dans la continuité du dialogue afro-asiatique sur le rôle des femmes dans la gouvernance et le déve-loppement durable, réunit des parlemen-taires venues du Ghana, du Mozambique, de la Zambie, du Sénégal, du Burundi, ainsi que d’Algérie, représentée par une délégation des deux chambres du Parle-ment. Selon un communiqué de l’Assem-blée populaire nationale, la participation algérienne illustre « la volonté constante de l’Algérie de promouvoir la place des femmes dans la vie politique et de renfor-cer la coopération Sud-Sud dans le domaine législatif ». La séance d’ouvertu-re a, d’ailleurs, été marquée par l’inter-vention de la représentante du Parlement algérien, qui a mis en avant les avancées réalisées en matière d’égalité des genres et de participation féminine à la vie publique, tout en appelant à intensifier les échanges d’expériences entre institu-tions africaines. Au programme de cette première journée figurent plusieurs conférences spécialisées suivies de débats interactifs autour de trois axes principaux : la protection des droits et la garantie de l’égalité entre les sexes, l’au-tonomisation des femmes pour un déve-loppement inclusif, et le partage d’un destin commun et la construction d’une société avec un avenir commun pour l’humanité. Ces thématiques traduisent la volonté de renforcer le rôle des femmes parlementaires dans la formula-tion de politiques publiques capables de répondre aux défis économiques, sociaux et environnementaux du continent afri-cain. La Conférence constitue également une plateforme d’échanges sur les straté-gies législatives visant à réduire les inéga-lités, promouvoir l’éducation des filles, améliorer la représentativité féminine dans les institutions politiques et encou-rager la coopération interparlementaire en matière de droits humains. En marge des travaux, plusieurs rencontres bilaté-rales sont prévues entre les délégations participantes, notamment pour examiner les possibilités de partenariats législatifs et de projets communs dans le domaine de la gouvernance inclusive. La participa-tion de l’Algérie, souvent citée comme modèle dans la région pour son engage-ment en faveur de la représentation fémi-nine au sein des instances élues, s’inscrit dans la continuité des réformes entre-prises ces dernières années pour renfor-cer la présence des femmes dans la sphè-re publique. Les travaux de la Conféren-ce se poursuivront jusqu’au 28 octobre et devraient aboutir à une déclaration com-mune visant à consolider la coopération africaine et à promouvoir une vision par-tagée du rôle des femmes parlementaires dans la construction d’un avenir plus équitable et solidaire. M. Seghilani LE MINISTRE FRANÇAIS DE L’INTÉRIEUR ESPÈRE RELANCER LE DIALOGUE AVEC L’ALGÉRIE Signe de bonne volonté ou simple ruse politique ? Laurent Nunez estime qu'il devait y avoir un « bougé » dans les relations avec l'Algérie, affirmant qu’une remise en cause de l'accord de 1968 n'était pas « à l'ordre du jour ». L es relations franco-algé-riennes vont-elles connaitre un réchauffe-ment ? C’est la question que se posent de nombreux observateurs politiques qui estiment que le départ de l’ancien pensionnaire de l’hô-tel Beauvau, siège du minis-tère de l’Intérieur, Bruno Retailleau, va créer une situa-tion de désescalade qui va permettre de renouer le dia-logue et tourner la page des tensions vécues cet été entre Alger et Paris. Le nouveau ministre de l’Intérieur, Lau-rent Nunez, est un fils d’émi-grés espagnols qui ont vécu à Oran après leur fuite d’Es-pagne durant la guerre civile qui avait permis à ex-roi Fran-co de prendre le pouvoir. Et même s’il est un militant du parti Renaissance, il semble ne pas cultiver de haine à l’égard des français d’ori-gines étrangères. La gauche lui reproche toutefois son rôle dans la répression du mouvement des Gilets jaunes quand il était préfet de police. Invité de France Inter/France Info/Le Monde, hier dimanche, il a estimé qu'il devait y avoir un « bougé » dans les relations avec l'Algérie, et affirmé qu'une remise en cause de l'accord franco-algérien de 1968 n'était pas « à l'ordre du jour », indique une dépêche de l'AFP. Cela pourrait tra-duire la volonté du gouver-nement Lecornu de tourner la page de Bruno Retailleau qui avait alimenté les ten-sions avec l’Algérie pour gagner des soutiens dans les cercles proches de l’extrême droite dans la perspective des présidentielles de 2027. Paris semble vouloir changer son fusil d’épaule puisque les urgences aujourd’hui ne sont plus les futures présiden-tielles mais la gestion d’une économie en berne qui ne pourrait pas survivre sans la relance des échanges avec les pays du sud de la méditer-ranée notamment l’Algérie et les pays du Sahel. « Je comprends que la tension qu'il y a actuellement avec l'Algérie fait qu'on n'a plus de relation sécuritaire avec eux, d'échanges sécuri-taires. Pour un ministre de l'Intérieur, c'est un problème, c'est un gros problème», a déclaré Laurent Nunez. Ce qui laisse supposer que la France va s’atteler dans les prochains jours à tenter de désamorcer les bombes ins-tallées par Bruno Retailleau pour torpiller ses relations avec l’Algérie. Et comme signe d’une volonté de dégel initié par la France, la présen-ce d’officiels français, sur autorisation de l’Elysée, aux festivités marquant la jour-née du 17 octobre 1961. Ce discours du nouveau ministre de l’Intérieur, et les signaux timides émis par la France sont-ils un gage de bonne volonté adressés en direction de l’Algérie ? C’est encore tôt pour l’affirmer et il faudra attendre d’autres signes plus significatifs et des déclarations de bonne volon-té pour y croire. Mais pour nombre d’observateurs, le départ de Bruno Retailleau signifie que le gouvernement Lecornu est décidé à tourner la page Sansal, celle des OQTF ou encore celle de l’abrogation de l’accord de 1968 conclu entre l’Algérie et la France. Slimane B. FACE À L’ESSOR DE L’INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE L’UGTA met en garde contre la disparition des emplois L e secrétaire général de l’Union générale des travailleurs algériens (UGTA), Amar Takdjout, a averti que la transformation numérique et l’expansion de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en Algérie entraîneront la dispari-tion de nombreux emplois. Dans une déclaration à la presse, en marge de la conférence internationale sur le thème « Autonomisation des syndicats arabes face à l’impact de l’intelligence artificiel-le sur le marché du travail », organisée par la Confédération arabe des syndi-cats (ATUC) et l’UGTA, Takdjout a indi-qué que la centrale syndicale s’emploie-ra à identifier ces postes afin de préser-ver les acquis des travailleurs et d’éviter une hausse du chômage liée à ces muta-tions technologiques. Il a souligné la nécessité d’adopter une approche proactive pour faire face aux change-ments rapides du marché du travail induits par l’IA. Selon lui, la transforma-tion numérique est devenue une réalité incontournable, et les syndicats doivent évoluer d’un rôle purement défensif vers un rôle de partenaire du dévelop-pement. Le responsable syndical a pré-cisé que les nouvelles technologies modifieront profondément la nature de nombreux métiers. Il a ainsi plaidé pour l’intégration du volet social dans la stra-tégie nationale de transformation numérique, notamment à travers la mise en place de mécanismes de recon-version et de requalification pour les tra-vailleurs dont les emplois pourraient être affectés par l’automatisation. «La technologie doit être un levier de créa-tion d’emplois, et non un facteur de chômage », a-t-il insisté, ajoutant que les syndicats eux-mêmes doivent se numériser dans leur gestion et leur organisation interne pour accompagner équitablement les mutations du monde du travail.

Hommage à la beauté féminine, le ZAOULI s’inspire de deux masques : le Blou et le Djela. Son autre nom, « Djela lou Zaouli », signifie « Zaouli, la fille de Djela ». Le Zaouli associe, dans un même spectacle, la sculpture (le masque), le tissage (le costume), la musique (l’orchestre, la chanson) et la danse. Le masque Zaouli se décline en sept masques faciaux traduisant chacun une légende spécifique. Les détenteurs et les praticiens sont les sculpteurs, les artisans, les instrumentistes, les chanteurs, les danseurs et les notables (garants des coutumes et des traditions de la communauté). Dès lors, le ZAOULI possède une fonction éducative, ludique et esthétique. Porteur de l’identité culturelle de ses détenteurs, il contribue également à la préservation de l’environnement, et favorise l’intégration et la cohésion sociale. La transmission de l’élément s’opère à l’occasion des représentations musicales et des séances d’apprentissage. Les amateurs en apprennent la pratique sous la supervision de praticiens expérimentés. La viabilité du ZAOULI est assurée grâce aux représentations populaires, organisées deux à trois fois par semaine par les communautés. La chefferie traditionnelle, garante des traditions, joue également un rôle clé dans le processus de transmission. Les festivals et les concours de danse inter-villages constituent également d’autres opportunités de revitalisation. En définitive, le ZAOULI est réputé détenir des pouvoirs permettant l’accroissement de la productivité du milieu dans lequel il est pratiqué. Inscrit sur la liste prestigieuse du Patrimoine Mondial de l’UNESCO, le ZAOULI est une synthèse de la sculpture, la musique et le tissage. Elle a donc pour but de mettre un point d’honneur sur la beauté féminine. C’est pourquoi, il se L ___________________________________________________________________ N.B. : Droits de reproduction et d’adaptation réservés pour tous pays Abidjan, Numéro spécial, Décembre 2024 ISSN-L : 2788-9343 / E-ISSN : 2959-7870 distingue par la finesse des traits du masque, la beauté de la danse et la grâce qui en font un spectacle fort apprécié dans les manifestations publiques.

Après une hausse de près de 2,9 millions de barils par jour depuis avril, **l’organisation prévoit une légère augmentation pour décembre 2025** avant une suspension durant le premier trimestre 2026. **Cette stratégie intervient dans un contexte de sanctions occidentales contre la Russie,** membre influent de l’Opep+. ## L’Opep+ modère sa production : une stratégie prudente face à un marché incertain Face à un marché pétrolier mondial incertain, **l’Opep+ a opté pour une approche prudente en ajustant légèrement à la hausse sa production** de pétrole en décembre 2025. 😱¡Aumenta el precio del barril de [#petróleo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/petr%C3%B3leo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!📈 tras el anuncio de que la [#OPEP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) pausará las subidas de producción a partir del primer trimestre de 2026 [pic.twitter.com/eqbBHVvZLF](https://t.co/eqbBHVvZLF) — XTB Latinoamérica (@XTBLatam) [November 3, 2025](https://twitter.com/XTBLatam/status/1985319647860662638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Cette décision intervient dans un contexte où le groupe craint un excédent d’offre sur le marché. **Depuis avril dernier, l’Opep+, qui regroupe les pays de l’Opep, la Russie et plusieurs autres producteurs,** avait augmenté ses objectifs de production de près de 2,9 millions de barils par jour. Cela représente environ 2,7% de la demande mondiale. Cependant, devant les signes d’une possible surabondance, **l’Opep+ a décidé de suspendre toute augmentation de production au premier trimestre 2026,** ralentissant ainsi le rythme des hausses initiées depuis octobre. OPEP+ suspend l’augmentation de la production de pétrole après décembre — CGTN Français (@CGTNFrancais) [November 2, 2025](https://twitter.com/CGTNFrancais/status/1985119500203655224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ## Sanctions occidentales contre la Russie : quel impact sur la stratégie de l’Opep+ ? **La stratégie de l’Opep+ est mise à l’épreuve par les sanctions occidentales imposées à la Russie** suite à l’invasion de l’Ukraine. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%20132%2079\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flag_of_OPEC.svg_-300x180.png) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%20132%2079\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flag_of_OPEC.svg_-300x180.png) Ces mesures, ciblant notamment Rosneft et Lukoil, **deux géants pétroliers russes, pourraient entraver la capacité de la Russie** à augmenter sa production. **L’Opep+ cherche à consolider sa position face à ses concurrents,** en particulier les producteurs américains. Cependant, **ces sanctions ajoutent une couche d’incertitude à un marché déjà instable,** obligeant le groupe à naviguer avec prudence dans ce contexte complexe. ## Pause hivernale dans la production de pétrole : une tradition respectée par l’Opep+ En décembre, huit pays membres de l’Opep+ (Arabie saoudite, Russie, Émirats arabes unis, Irak, Koweït, Oman, Kazakhstan et Algérie) ont décidé d’augmenter leurs objectifs de production de 137 000 barils par jour, comme ils l’avaient fait en octobre et novembre. 🛢️ L’OPEP+ relance la production ! ➡️ +137 000 barils/jour dès décembre 2025 🇩🇿 L’Algérie : +4000 barils/jour Objectif : soutenir un marché pétrolier stable 🌍[#OPEP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Algérie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Alg%C3%A9rie?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Énergie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%C3%89nergie?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#MarchéPétrolier](https://twitter.com/hashtag/March%C3%A9P%C3%A9trolier?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/POPi6LKwbw](https://t.co/POPi6LKwbw) — elwatan-dz.com (@elwatandzcom) [November 3, 2025](https://twitter.com/elwatandzcom/status/1985305071022747768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) **Cette augmentation s’inscrit dans une stratégie de réponse à la demande mondiale.** Cependant, ces pays ont choisi de suspendre les augmentations de production pour janvier, février et mars 2026. Cette pause hivernale est une tradition, car cette période correspond généralement à un ralentissement de la demande de pétrole. **L’Opep+ avait déjà adopté des décisions similaires lors des années précédentes.** ##### Partager cet article sur ![Mehdi Moussaïd](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%2080%2080\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![Mehdi Moussaïd](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mehdi-Moussaid-scaled-80x80.jpg) ## Écrit par [Mehdi Moussaïd](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/auteur/mehdi/) Journaliste indépendant spécialisé dans l’économie, l’énergie et le développement industriel en Algérie.

Zigaretten auf dem Schwarzmarkt. Illegale Zigaretten kosteten den Staat im letzten Jahr allein 401 Millionen Euro. Ab 1. September starten der BDZ und Philip Morris Deutschland deshalb eine gemeinsame Aufklärungskampagne. von Sprit+ --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [Folgen auf:](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJqxqAwwgI_tAg?hl=de&gl=DE&ceid=DE:de) --- * [#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\") * [#Tabakkonsum](/tag/tabakkonsum-3368052 \"Tabakkonsum\") * [#Tabaksteuer](/tag/tabaksteuer-3692852 \"Tabaksteuer\") Nur 38 Prozent der Befragten lehnen den Kauf illegaler Waren – etwa geschmuggelter Zigaretten – konsequent ab. Gleichzeitig zeigt fast die Hälfte (48 Prozent) zumindest Verständnis für solche Käufe. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer repräsentativen Online-[Umfrage](/tag/umfrage-1712250 \"Mehr zum Thema Umfrage\") des Meinungsforschungsinstituts Bonsai Public im Auftrag von [Philip Morris](/tag/philip-morris-2020390 \"Mehr zum Thema Philip Morris\") Deutschland*1*. Kriminelle Strukturen scheinen bereits tief in der Gesellschaft verankert zu sein und zunehmend akzeptiert oder in Kauf genommen zu werden. Angesichts wachsender Steuerverluste, eines florierenden Schwarzmarkts und der Stärkung krimineller Netzwerke, die mit Menschenhandel, Drogen- und Waffenkriminalität verbunden sind, hält Philip Morris dies für ein besorgniserregendes Signal. Die Bedrohung durch die Organisierte Kriminalität wird von acht von zehn Befragten als hoch oder sehr hoch eingeschätzt – und das nicht ohne Grund: 59 Prozent erleben sie bereits als Teil ihres Alltags und ist davon überzeugt, dass sie auch in der eigenen Region stattfindet. Deutschland als Produktionsort für illegale Zigaretten – dem Haupttreiber und eine zentrale Finanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität – können sich immerhin über 40 Prozent vorstellen. Damit ist das Thema für viele keine abstrakte Bedrohung in fernen Ländern mehr. Fast die Hälfte der Befragten fordert daher, dass die Politik dem Kampf gegen Organisierte Kriminalität deutlich mehr Priorität einräumen muss. Gleichzeitig zeigt die Umfrage erhebliche Wissenslücken: Die Rolle illegaler Zigaretten als eine Hauptfinanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität wird stark unterschätzt. ## Die Kampagne Genau hier will die neue bundesweite Aufklärungskampagne von Philip Morris Deutschland und der BDZ Deutsche Zoll- und Finanzgewerkschaft ansetzen. Ziel ist es, auf den illegalen Handel und dessen Verbindungen zur Organisierten Kriminalität aufmerksam zu machen. Die Kernbotschaft lautet: \"Der Handel mit illegalen Tabakwaren ist kein Kavaliersdelikt – er gefährdet die öffentliche [Sicherheit](/tag/sicherheit-1366953 \"Mehr zum Thema Sicherheit\"), verursacht erhebliche wirtschaftliche Schäden und stärkt kriminelle Netzwerke.\" Geplant sind Informationsmaßnahmen im öffentlichen Raum. Auch das Bild eines stetigen Stroms illegaler [Produkte](/tag/produkte-1654301 \"Mehr zum Thema Produkte\") wird aufgegriffen: Insgesamt werden 17 [Lkw](/tag/lkw-1359261 \"Mehr zum Thema Lkw\") mit bedruckten Heckflächen unterwegs sein, um Aufmerksamkeit auf das Thema zu lenken. Im Jahr 2024 wurden hierzulande schätzungsweise 1,7 Milliarden illegale Zigaretten konsumiert – ein Lkw steht damit symbolisch für 100 Millionen illegal konsumierte Zigaretten. ## Wirtschaft und Sicherheit werden untergraben Allein in Deutschland entgingen dem Staat im vergangenen Jahr rund 401 Millionen Euro an Steuereinnahmen allein durch den Konsum illegal hergestellter Zigaretten (Quelle: KPMG Report 2024). Gewinne aus dem illegalen Handel fließen häufig in andere kriminelle Aktivitäten. Damit untergräbt der illegale Zigarettenmarkt nicht nur wirtschaftliche Strukturen, sondern auch die öffentliche Sicherheit. \"Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage sprechen eine deutliche Sprache: Eine alarmierende Akzeptanz illegaler Produkte untergräbt unsere Gesellschaft und stärkt die Organisierte Kriminalität. Besonders der Handel mit illegalen Zigaretten spielt dabei eine große Rolle – er finanziert kriminelle Strukturen. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Organisierte Kriminalität keine Randerscheinung ist, sondern eine präsente Bedrohung für die öffentliche Sicherheit“, so Tammo Körner, Senior Manager Fiscal Affairs & ITP bei Philip Morris Deutschland. Nach Ansicht von Phlip Morris ist ein entschlossenes Vorgehen auf mehreren Ebenen notwendig: * Die Kriminalitätsbekämpfung muss gestärkt werden. * Eine verbesserte internationale Zusammenarbeit gegen die meist grenzüberschreitend operierenden Netzwerke. * Eine umfassenden Aufklärungsarbeit, um Bürgern für die Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Kauf illegaler Zigaretten und der Finanzierung krimineller Aktivitäten zu sensibilisieren. Thomas Liebel, Bundesvorsitzender der BDZ, ergänzt: \"Der Zoll ist der Schutzwall, der Staatseinnahmen sichert, die Wirtschaft vor kriminellen Einflüssen bewahrt und die Sicherheit der Bevölkerung gewährleistet. Doch trotz wachsender Aufgaben, etwa angesichts der Zunahme illegaler Produktionsstätten für Zigaretten und immer professioneller organisierter Geldwäsche, wird die Modernisierung des Zolls durch anhaltende Sparmaßnahmen gebremst – und das kommt die Allgemeinheit teuer zu stehen.\" *1Online-Umfrage im August 2025 unter 1.000 Personen in Deutschland im Alter von 18 bis 69 Jahren.* --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [ZUR STARTSEITE](/ \"Zur Startseite\") --- ### HASHTAG --- ## *[#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\")* 22.08.2025 [#Intertabac](/tag/intertabac-1986923 \"Intertabac\") ## [Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025](/nachrichten/tabak-und-tabakersatz/nicht-verpassen-landewyck-auf-der-intertabac-2025-3701358 \"Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025\") [Bei Landewyck bildet wie schon im Vorjahr die Mademoiselle den Hauptblickfang des Messestands auf der Intertabac.

Dahinter verbarg sich einer der meistgesuchten Drogenbosse Europas. Nun stand eine der Frauen in Zürich vor Gericht. ![René Laglstorfer](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/3tw5IWneaKo8BIJbXh_YFL.jpg) ![Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/BLeGt9CK4FP9PcnTeZSeEt.jpg \"Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht\") Der Albtraum begann in den Ferien mit einem Anruf ihrer Enkelin im Juli 2022. «Fedpol und Kantonspolizei durchsuchen gerade dein Haus», sagte die junge Frau zu ihrer Grossmutter. «Ich bin komplett durch den Wind gewesen und habe gedacht: Spinnen die?», schildert die 63-Jährige. Die Frau ist langjährige Beizerin am Bodensee. 2013 hatte sie eine Firma gegründet, um in einer thurgauischen Seegemeinde ein Hotel zu bauen. Doch Investoren blieben aus, im November 2020 wollte die Beizerin die Firma wieder loswerden. «Ich habe meiner Treuhänderin Aida P. (Name geändert) eine Vollmacht gegeben, die Firma zu verkaufen, aber ich wusste nicht, an wen», sagt die Wirtin dieser Redaktion. Zurück aus den Ferien wurde die Frau zwei Stunden lang einvernommen. Polizisten hätten viele Fragen gestellt und ihr zig Blätter mit Namen darauf gezeigt, von denen sie niemanden gekannt habe. «Ich finde es verrückt, wie leicht man in so was hineingeraten kann», sagt die Beizerin. ## Dolder, Baur au Lac und Rüschlikon Rund fünf Monate vor dem scheinbar unbedeutenden Firmenverkauf waren der damals 33-jährige «Artur Gitta» und die 26-jährige «Simone Jung» als Touristen in die Schweiz eingereist. Für mehr als 75’000 Franken und mit gefälschten Reisepässen checkte das deutsche Paar im Juni 2020 für einen Monat im Zürcher Luxushotel Dolder ein. Es folgten zwei Wochen im Baur au Lac für rund 22’000 Franken, bis das offenbar wohlhabende Paar in einer Villa am See in Rüschlikon für monatlich 18’000 Franken eine feste Bleibe fand. ![Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/7U7oS4JR4Dc9sHOL49V5wV.jpg \"Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23\") Damit endete die jahrelange Flucht rund um den Globus von einem der meistgesuchten Kriminellen Europas: Denn hinter dem Namen «Artur Gitta» verbirgt sich der belgische Kokainkönig Flor Bressers, dessen Drogenkartell tonnenweise Rauschgift nach Europa geschmuggelt haben soll. «Simone Jung» wiederum ist die gefälschte Identität seiner holländischen Lebensgefährtin [Philomina Veenstra](/freundin-von-kokainkoenig-sass-monatelang-mit-baby-in-zuercher-gefaengnis-134865075326) (Name geändert). ## Familiengründung in der Schweiz 20 Monate lang, bis zu seiner [spektakulären Verhaftung](/belgischer-topverbrecher-von-zuercher-spezialeinheit-verhaftet-276783770429) im Februar 2022 in einer Luxuswohnung im Zürcher Renaissance-Tower, sollte Flor Bressers einen sicheren Hafen in der Schweiz haben. Von hier aus konnte der Kokainkönig unbehelligt sein internationales Drogenkartell lenken. So sicher muss er sich gefühlt haben, dass er in dieser Zeit mit seiner Freundin eine Familie gründete – ein Sohn kam in der Schweiz zur Welt. Das Paar führte ein Leben in Saus und Braus mit [Ausgaben in Millionenhöhe,](/das-unglaubliche-luxusleben-des-belgischen-kokainkoenigs-am-zuerichsee-184889075678) wie diese Redaktion zuerst berichtete. ## Flor Bressers findet einen Job Möglich gemacht haben das Luxusleben, finanziert aus dem internationalen Drogenhandel, am Zürichsee zahlreiche Helfer. Doch nicht alle dürften gewusst haben, wer sich hinter «Gitta» wirklich verbarg, wie Recherchen zeigen. ![Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/2gwpU9f1qKaA7utZtF82KO.jpg \"Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.\") Eine dieser Helferinnen ist die eingangs erwähnte Treuhänderin Aida P., die sich am Donnerstag wegen schwerer Geldwäscherei, Begünstigung und Täuschung der Behörden vor dem Bezirksgericht Zürich verantworten muss. Die Thurgauerin konnte den sichtlich wohlhabenden «Artur Gitta» spätestens Ende August 2020 – wenige Monate nach dessen Ankunft in der Schweiz – zu ihrem Kundenkreis zählen. ## «Anschein eines rechtschaffenen Bürgers» Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Aida P. vor, nicht nur einen Wohnsitz für «Gitta» und dessen Familie an der Zürcher Goldküste für einen maximalen Mietbetrag von monatlich 25’000 Franken gesucht zu haben. Die 36-Jährige soll ihm bereits Ende August zum Schein einen Arbeitsvertrag als Mitarbeiter in ihrem Treuhandbüro ausgestellt haben. «Die Idee war, unseren Kundenstamm über sein Netzwerk zu erweitern. Er wollte Neukunden bringen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. Als Wohnort gab sie dessen Adresse in einem Wohnblock im thurgauischen Amriswil an, wo er jedoch laut den Ermittlern nie gewohnt hat. ![Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/EdaEx7mbKe29b_TumnzYuR.jpg \"Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.\") Gestützt auf diese Angaben, stellte das Migrationsamt Thurgau dem angeblichen Artur Gitta eine B-Aufenthaltsbewilligung aus. «Mit ihrem Verhalten und ihren Tätigkeiten erweckte die Beschuldigte den Anschein, dass es sich bei Artur Gitta (Flor Bressers) um einen rechtschaffenen Bürger handelte», heisst es in der Anklageschrift. Auch soll Aida P. «Gitta» dabei unterstützt haben, dass er bei Behörden nie selber oder mit seinen echten Personalien auftreten musste. Damit habe sie ihm «wissentlich oder willentlich geholfen», seine wahre Identität zu verschleiern und ihn dem Zugriff der Strafverfolgungsbehörden zu entziehen. ## Der Finanzchef und der Concierge Als schwerster Vorwurf wiegt jedoch, dass die 36-jährige Treuhänderin Gelder aus dem Kokainhandel gewaschen haben soll, indem sie diese entgegennahm und in der Schweiz investierte. Der direkte Gewinn für die Treuhänderin betrug dabei laut Anklageschrift 51’000 Franken, wobei aus einem Bauprojekt am Bodensee weitere 100’000 Franken erwartet wurden. Ab September 2020 erhielten Aida P. und ihre 34-jährige Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. (Name geändert) über Geldkuriere nachweislich insgesamt 320’000 Franken Bargeld von drei Männern: «Gitta», dessen damals ebenso im Kanton Zürich lebenden Finanzchef Bastiaan K. und einem ergebenen [privaten Concierge](/concierge-ermoeglichte-luxusleben-wie-sich-der-kokainkoenig-in-zuerich-versteckte-847540903985). ## Wusste die Treuhänderin, wer Artur Gitta wirklich ist? 190’000 Franken davon seien in zwei Tranchen jeweils in einer Schuhschachtel in Aida P.s Treuhandbüro am Bodensee übergeben worden. Das Geld war vorgesehen, um die unverdächtige Firma der eingangs erwähnten Beizerin zu kaufen. Die Kauf- und Vertragsverhandlungen dafür führte Aida P. laut Staatsanwaltschaft im Namen von «Gitta». 190’000 Franken Bargeld gingen an die Beizerin. Vor Gericht sagt die Treuhänderin: «Wir haben seinen Ausweis überprüft, aber nicht sein Geld.» Auch für zwei Banken sei Artur Gitta «sauber» gewesen. Nach der Übernahme wurde die Firma in «Gitta Suisse AG» umbenannt und residierte an der derselben Adresse am Bodensee wie das Treuhandbüro. Dies sollte Flor Bressers den Anschein eines gewöhnlichen Unternehmers verleihen mit offiziellem Wohn- und Arbeitsort im ländlichen Thurgau. ![Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. ](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/9qlyQJe14XOAq3ua2_2vsd.jpg \"Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. \") Mit Geld vom Konto seiner unscheinbaren Firma kaufte die Treuhänderin im Februar 2021 zehn Kilo Silberbarren im Schätzwert von 6800 Franken und verwahrte sie im Bankschliessfach ihres Büros. ## Die verzweigten Geldflüsse der Treuhänderinnen Die verbleibenden etwa 130’000 Franken Bargeld zahlten Aida P. und ihre Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. in vier- bis fünfstelligen Beträgen zunächst auf ihre Privatkonten ein. Von dort überwiesen die beiden Frauen das Geld laut Anklageschrift unter Angabe falscher Gründe, etwa «Rückzahlung Kleinkredit», auf das Firmenkonto ihres Treuhandbüros. Von diesem und einem weiteren Firmenkonto der Gitta Suisse AG überwies Aida P. zwischen September 2020 und November 2021 elf «fingierte Gehaltszahlungen» an Artur Gitta über jeweils 4500 Franken – insgesamt rund 50’000 Franken. Doch laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat «Gitta» nie für das Treuhandbüro am Bodensee gearbeitet. «Man hätte es vermuten können, wer er in Wahrheit ist, aber ich habe es nicht vermutet. Ich bin zu wenig vorsichtig gewesen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. ## Falsche Angaben bei Behörden Im Juni und Juli 2021 soll die beschuldigte Treuhänderin bei den Steuer- und Einwohnerbehörden der Stadt Amriswil unwahre Angaben über den tatsächlichen Wohnort des Kokainkönigs gemacht haben. Zur selben Zeit überwies Aida P. 70’000 Franken auf ihr Privatkonto, um damit bei einem Luxusgeschäft im Zürcher Kreis 4 eine exklusive Stereoanlage für «Gitta» zu kaufen. Dieser gab mit seiner Lebensgefährtin im selben Laden weitere 64’000 Franken aus. Für Schmuck waren es 667’000 Franken und für Wein 400’000 Franken – über 2,5 Millionen Franken in etwa 20 Monaten. ## Finanzchef wird am Basler Flughafen verhaftet Im Oktober 2021 musste «Gitta» einen schweren Rückschlag verdauen: Sein engster Vertrauter, der erwähnte Finanzchef Bastiaan K., wurde am Flughafen Basel-Mulhouse verhaftet und später nach Belgien ausgeliefert. Dasselbe Schicksal ereilte den als Flor Bressers enttarnten «Gitta» vier Monate später. Beide mutmasslichen Schwerkriminellen warten seither mit 33 weiteren Beschuldigten auf ihren Prozess in Belgien, wie diese Redaktion aus Justizkreisen erfahren hat. Bei einer Verurteilung drohen beiden lange Gefängnisstrafen. ## «Die Alarmglocken müssen schrillen» Weit glimpflicher kommen die beiden Treuhänderinnen dank Geständnissen und eines Deals mit der Staatsanwaltschaft davon. Giulia S. erhielt einen rechtskräftigen Strafbefehl mit einer bedingten Geldstrafe von 180 Tagessätzen à 90 Franken und einer Geldbusse von 3900 Franken. Zudem muss sie 80’000 Franken als Ersatzforderung an den Staat zahlen. ![Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/6dudW4BXquo9FvO50rGpti.jpg \"Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)\") Am Ende erkennt Aida P. sämtliche Vorwürfe an. Die Richter verurteilten sie zu einer bedingten Freiheitsstrafe von zwölf Monaten sowie zu eine bedingten Geldstrafe von 90 Tagessätzen à 110 Franken – insgesamt 9900 Franken. Ausserdem muss sie 120’000 Franken mutmassliche Drogengelder an den Staat zahlen. «Wenn man soviel Bargeld erhält, müssen im Kopf die Alarmglocken schrillen. Das war bei Ihnen nicht der Fall», sagte der Richter zum Schluss. Das Urteil ist nicht rechtskräftig.

Aida P. allegedly helped Bressers conceal his true identity by providing a false identity (\"Artur Gitta\"), securing a Swiss residence permit under false pretenses, and issuing a sham employment contract to create the appearance of a legitimate citizen. She is accused of knowingly facilitating money laundering by receiving and investing drug proceeds in Switzerland, including handling at least CHF 320,000 in cash delivered by money couriers connected to Bressers and his associates. Part of these funds (CHF 190,000) were used to purchase a local company under Bressers’ control, with Aida P. conducting negotiations on his behalf. The treuhänderin reportedly profited directly by CHF 51,000, with further gains expected. The case highlights failures in KYC and suspicious transaction monitoring, as banks reportedly considered \"Artur Gitta\" a clean client despite the underlying criminal activity.

Das erklärte Kostjantyn Milewski, Leiter der Koordinierung des Militärdiensts von Ausländern in den Streitkräften der Ukraine, in einem Interview. Über alle Teilstreitkräfte hinweg könnten es sogar mehr als doppelt so viele sein. Darunter seien auch rund 500 Deutsche. Die mit Abstand größte Gruppe der Ausländer komme jedoch aus Kolumbien. Nach ukrainischen Angaben wächst das russische Truppenkontingent trotz massiver Verluste weiter an. Für die Ukraine wird es zunehmend schwierig, die eigenen Truppen zu verstärken (T-Online). **7.

Der Kreml bestätigte, ein Treffen der Staatschefs werde vorbereitet. Beide Seiten haben sich offenbar auf den Ort des Treffens geeinigt, diesen allerdings nicht bekannt gegeben. Von einem Treffen mit dem ukrainischen Präsidenten Wolodymyr Selenskyj war auf russischer Seite allerdings keine Rede (Zeit).

Keiner der Parteien gelinge es, entscheidende Geländegewinne zu erzielen. Der Krieg habe sich in eine zermürbende Abnutzungsschlacht verwandelt, mit allen Risiken für militärische Stabilität, wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit und politische Resilienz auf beiden Seiten (Berliner Zeitung).

Dies geschehe um sich für den Fall zu wappnen, dass die „törichten und aufrührerischen Äußerungen” des russischen Ex-Präsidenten Dmitri Medwedew mehr als nur dies seien. Nachdem Trump vergangene Woche das Ultimatum an Putin auf zehn Tage verkürzt und heftige Sanktionen in den Raum gestellt hatte, drohte Medwedew mit einer nuklearen Auseinandersetzung zwischen Russland und den USA. Wenn Medwedew über Atomwaffen rede, müsse Amerika vorbereitet sein, so nun Trumps Reaktion, die in den USA auf ein geteiltes Echo stieß (Tagesschau). **1.

Gleitbomben dieser Art werden von russischen Kampfjets über russisch kontrolliertem Gebiet nahe der Front abgeworfen und schlagen dann auf ukrainischer Seite ein. Für die ukrainische Flugabwehr sind die Jets außer Reichweite, und aufgrund der kurzen Flugzeit der Bomben gibt es so gut wie keine Vorwarnzeit für die Bevölkerung (Tagesschau). [**Ostukraine - Steht Pokrowsk vor russischer Besatzung?**](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/pokrowsk-ukraine-russland-100.html \"Tagesschau [Link öffnet sich in neuem Tab]\") Russland ist es in den vergangenen Monaten gelungen, in der ostukrainischen Region Donbass Dorf um Dorf immer weiter vorzurücken. Auch die Stadt und die Region Pokrowsk im Gebiet Donezk stehen seit Anfang des Jahres unter Dauerbeschuss. Die Behörden rufen eindringlich zur Evakuierung auf, es könnte nur noch knapp zwei Wochen dauern, bis die russische Armee auch bis hierher vorgerückt ist, so die Warnung. Es wäre harter Schlag für die Ukraine, sollte Pokrowsk unter russische Besatzung geraten, der Ort gilt als wichtiger logistischer Knotenpunkt in der Region Donezk (Tagesschau). ### Weitere Beiträge [**Trump droht Russland mit weiteren Sanktionen**](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/krieg-in-der-ukraine-donald-trump-droht-russland-mit-weiteren-sanktionen-a-be9727c9-24ed-4886-8603-284fa18632ed \"Spiegel [Link öffnet sich in neuem Tab]\") Russlands Vorgehen in der Ukraine sei »widerwärtig«: Donald Trump hat seine Sanktionsdrohungen gegen den Kreml abermals verschärft.

Die Zehn-Tage-Frist beginne “ab heute”, so Trump. Sollte es keine Einigung auf eine Waffenruhe oder eine Friedensvereinbarung innerhalb der Frist gebe, droht Trump mit deutlich höheren Zöllen für Russlands Handelspartner. Damit soll die wirtschaftliche Basis des Kremls weiter geschwächt werden, indem vor allem große Abnehmer wie China und Indien stärker unter Druck gesetzt werden. Welche Länder es konkret treffen könnte, hat Trump bislang nicht ausgeführt (Welt).

Die Szene jubelt – doch Experten sehen auch Risiken. 09.03.2025 - 11:25 Uhr US-Präsident Trump. Foto: Alex Brandon/AP/dpa Krypto-ABC: Die wichtigsten Begriffe verständlich erklärt ### Problematischer Schulterschluss? Der Scherz verdeutlicht, wie stark sich das politische Klima für die Branche unter Trump gewandelt hat. Sein demokratischer Amtsvorgänger Joe Biden setzte auf eine restriktive Regulierung von Digitalwährungen und warnte vor Geldwäsche sowie potenziellen Risiken für die Finanzmärkte. Trump hingegen zeigte sich bereits im Wahlkampf aufgeschlossen gegenüber Digitalwährungen – und erhielt beträchtliche Unterstützung aus der Branche. Nach seinem Wahlsieg war unter anderem der [Bitcoin-Kurs](/boerse/isin/G1007) stark gestiegen. Kritiker sehen allerdings einen potenziell problematischen Schulterschluss zwischen dem Präsidentenamt und den wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Trump-Familie. So ließ der Republikaner kurz vor seinem Amtsantritt einen sogenannten „Meme Coin“ mit seinem Konterfei namens „$TRUMP“ auflegen – eine digitale Gedenkmünze, die gehandelt werden kann. Im Zusammenhang damit sorgen die Branchen-Verbindungen der Trump Organization, die von den Söhnen des Präsidenten geführt wird, für Diskussionen. [### Soll die EZB jetzt Bitcoin kaufen?

In dieser strategischen Reserve sollen Einheiten der bekanntesten [Kryptowährung](/themen/kryptowaehrung) [Bitcoin](/themen/bitcoin) gelagert werden, die sich bereits im Besitz der US-Regierung befinden – etwa durch Beschlagnahmungen im Rahmen von Strafverfolgungen.

Weiterhin sollen auch andere Währungen wie [Ethereum](/boerse/isin/G1008) und Solana in einem separaten Bestand verwahrt werden. Die Regierung werde jedoch keine aktiven Maßnahmen ergreifen, um diese Bestände systematisch auszubauen. Durch staatliche Maßnahmen gegen kriminelle Netzwerke verfügt die US-Regierung bereits über Zehntausende Bitcoin. Sacks bezifferte den aktuellen Bestand auf rund 200.000 Einheiten.

Der Grund: Dessen Pistolen könnten von Kriminellen leicht zu vollautomatischen Waffen umgebaut werden – mit verheerenden Folgen. Von [Stefan Melichar](https://www.profil.at/author/stefan.melichar) 02.03.25 Drucken Schriftgröße „Sie sollten jetzt sofort damit aufhören!“ Das ist es, was Brandon Scott, Bürgermeister der US-Metropole Baltimore, der Führungsriege des österreichischen Waffenproduzenten Glock ausrichtet. profil hat diese Woche mit dem Stadt-Chef gesprochen. Womit das Unternehmen aus Sicht von Scott aufhören soll, ist schnell erklärt: mit dem Verkauf von Pistolenmodellen, die – so der Vorwurf – von Kriminellen besonders leicht zu verbotenen vollautomatischen Waffen umgebaut werden können. Der Bürgermeister und der Stadtrat von Baltimore haben deshalb Mitte Februar eine Klage gegen Glock eingebracht – und zwar gemeinsam mit dem Bundesstaat Maryland, in dem die 550.000-Einwohner-Stadt liegt. Es ist nicht die erste Klage dieser Art in den Vereinigten Staaten: Den Anfang machte vor knapp einem Jahr Chicago, [profil berichtete ausführlich](https://www.profil.at/wirtschaft/glock-muss-aufhoeren-profit-ueber-oeffentliche-sicherheit-zu-stellen/402844672). Ende 2024 setzten dann auch der Bundesstaat Minnesota und der Generalstaatsanwalt von New Jersey rechtliche Schritte. Chicago hatte ursprünglich nur die Firma Glock, Inc. in den USA geklagt. Eine später neu eingebrachte Version der Klage richtet sich – wie alle anderen mittlerweile vorliegenden Klagen – nun jedoch auch gegen die Glock Ges.m.b.H. mit Sitz in Deutsch-Wagram in Niederösterreich. „Es ist sehr klar, dass Glock wissentlich Feuerwaffen hergestellt und verkauft hat, die auf einzigartige Weise leicht umzubauen sind“, sagt Baltimores Bürgermeister Scott zu profil. Das heize die Waffengewalt in der Stadt an. 2023 seien in Baltimore rund 35 modifizierte Glock-Pistolen sichergestellt worden, heißt es in der Klage. 2024 seien es schon zumindest 65 gewesen – also fast doppelt so viele. Waffengewalt sei „eine Krankheit“, meint Scott. Die stark von Kriminalität geprägte 2,7-Millionen-Einwohner-Metropole Chicago verweist in ihrer Klagsschrift sogar auf 1300 modifizierte Glocks, die dort von 2021 bis Mai 2024 durch die Polizei aufgefunden worden seien. ## Umschalten und abdrücken Stein des Anstoßes ist ein kleiner Bauteil – eine Art Schalter (auf Englisch: „switch“) –, der hinten an der Pistole angesetzt werden kann und den Auslösemechanismus beeinflusst. Die Waffe feuert dann, solange der Abzug gedrückt bleibt und Patronen im Magazin sind. Eine legale halbautomatische Faustfeuerwaffe wird dadurch zur Maschinenpistole. Und vollautomatische Waffen sind sogar im Schießpulver-Paradies USA für Zivilisten verboten – wegen ihrer verheerenden Wirkung. 8. April 2023: In einer öffentlichen Wohnanlage in Newark im Bundesstaat New Jersey feuert ein Schütze 28 Mal mit einer Neun-Millimeter-Glock-Pistole. Dafür braucht er nur etwas mehr als eine Sekunde, drei Menschen werden schwer verletzt, wie es in der Klage von Generalstaatsanwalt Matthew Platkin heißt. Dies sei möglich gewesen, weil die Waffe mit einem „Switch“ zu einer Maschinenpistole gemacht worden sei, hält Platkin fest. Derartige „Switches“ könnten für weniger als 20 US-Dollar gekauft und in nicht einmal fünf Minuten installiert werden. Glock-Pistolen, die auf diese Weise modifiziert sind, könnten eine Feuergeschwindigkeit von 1200 Schuss pro Minute erreichen. Der Rückstoß sei so schwer zu kontrollieren, dass sich die Kugeln üblicherweise unkontrolliert über ein größeres Gebiet verteilen. ## „Glock hat die Angelegenheit einfach ignoriert“ Glock stellt die „Switches“ nicht selbst her. Viele davon kommen laut Klage aus China oder aus dem 3D-Drucker. Auch sind Glock-Pistolen nicht die einzigen Faustfeuerwaffen, die modifiziert werden können. Der Vorwurf, der in den USA nun laut wird, ist jedoch, dass dies bei gängigen Glock-Modellen besonders einfach möglich wäre. Dieser Umstand sei Glock auch bewusst. Dennoch weigere sich das Unternehmen, das Design der Waffen so anzupassen, dass die Modifikation entscheidend erschwert wird – obwohl dies zumutbar wäre. „Glock hat die Angelegenheit einfach ignoriert und zugelassen, dass das so weitergeht“, meint Baltimores Bürgermeister Scott im profil-Gespräch. New Jerseys Generalstaatsanwalt Platkin wiederum warf den österreichischen Glock-Eigentümern in einer Aussendung im Dezember vor, ihre Taschen mit Gewinnen zu füllen, welche durch Blutvergießen in Amerika bezahlt würden. Ein Blutvergießen, das durch Glock-Produkte genährt werde. Platkin wirft dem Unternehmen vor, Gier vor die Sicherheit von Einwohnern und Polizisten zu stellen. Diese Zeiten seien jedoch vorüber. ## Glock beantragte Abweisung Was sagt Glock dazu? Auf profil-Anfrage gar nichts: Glock kommentiere laufende Gerichtsverfahren nicht, heißt es von der Pressestelle des Unternehmens. Doch das bereits am längsten laufende US-Verfahren – jenes, das von der Stadt Chicago angestoßen wurde – lässt auf Basis dort eingebrachter Schriftsätze zumindest eine erste Einschätzung zu, was die Argumentationslinie des Waffenherstellers betrifft. Die österreichische Glock Ges. m.b.H. beantragte demnach im Oktober 2024 die Abweisung der Klage mit der Behauptung, diese sei nicht korrekt zugestellt worden – und außerdem falle die österreichische Firma nicht unter die Gerichtsbarkeit des US-Bundesstaats Illinois, in dem Chicago liegt. Auch der US-Ableger von Glock, die Glock Inc. in Georgia, stellte den Antrag, die Klage abzuweisen. Vereinfacht zusammengefasst argumentiert das Unternehmen: Wenn kriminelle Dritte legale Produkte missbrauchen würden, könne Glock nicht dafür zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. Die gesetzliche Grundlage, auf die sich Chicago beziehe, sei verfassungswidrig – unter anderem sei sie zu vage. ## Weitere Klagen möglich Eric Tirschwell ist Executive Director von „Everytown Law“, einer Organisation, die sich gegen Schusswaffengewalt einsetzt. Der Rechtsexperte hat sowohl an der Klage der Stadt Chicago als auch an jener von Baltimore und Maryland mitgearbeitet. Im profil-Interview will Tirschwell die Argumente von Glock nicht gelten lassen: Der Bundesstaat Illinois habe kürzlich ein Gesetz verabschiedet, das Waffenhersteller verpflichte, nicht durch unangemessenes Verhalten („unreasonable conduct“) zu einer Schädigung der Öffentlichkeit beizutragen. „Wir erheben den Vorwurf, dass der Verkauf von Waffen, welche derart leicht modifiziert werden können, unangemessenes Verhalten ist“, hält Tirschwell fest. Entscheidungen zu Design, Marketing und Verkauf in den USA würden zumindest teilweise in Österreich gefällt. Außerdem würden Pistolenteile und auch ganze Pistolen aus Österreich in die USA kommen. Das sei ausreichend für eine Gerichtszuständigkeit in den Vereinigten Staaten, meint Tirschwell. Für März ist eine mündliche Verhandlung im Chicago-Verfahren anberaumt. Dann werde das Gericht entscheiden, ob der Fall fortgesetzt werden kann, erklärt Tirschwell. Wenn ja, müsse Glock relevante Dokumente herausgeben, und Mitarbeiter sowie Manager des Unternehmens könnten unter Eid befragt werden. Sollte das Gericht die Klage abweisen, werde es wahrscheinlich ein Rechtsmittel dagegen geben. „Sofern Glock den Verkauf leicht modifizierbarer Waffen nicht stoppt, denke ich nicht, dass die jüngste Klage (Anm.: jene von Baltimore und Maryland) die letzte sein wird“, sagt Tirschwell. Glock dürfte also noch länger nicht aus der Schusslinie sein. Newsletter Drucken (profil.at) | Stand: ### Stefan Melichar [StefanMelichar](https://x.com/StefanMelichar) ist Chefreporter bei profil.

These modifications have been linked to increased gun violence, with authorities citing hundreds of such modified Glock pistols recovered between 2021 and 2024. The lawsuits accuse Glock of ignoring the issue and prioritizing profits over public safety. Glock has responded by seeking dismissal of the Chicago lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds and arguing that misuse by third parties should not hold the company liable. A court hearing is scheduled for March 2025 to decide whether the case proceeds, with potential discovery and depositions if allowed.

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: 2023-03-08 | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290) | Legal Status: Ongoing sanctions enforcement | Lukoil is listed among major Russian oil companies sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under OFAC authorities as part of measures related to the conflict in Ukraine.

With an eye on future trends, this week we lead by exploring Web3, the catch-all term for the vision of a new internet which at its core uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. For some it represents a transition from big corporations controlling and monetising content on the internet to individuals sharing content and interacting through decentralised networks. But for others, the notion of a decentralised internet presents many challenges, especially how to identify, prosecute, and prevent financial crime on the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets are inextricably linked to the concept of Web3, so we also deliver the latest news surrounding the world of virtual currencies and renewed efforts by authorities to detect and prevent crime in the sector. In addition, we feature updates on global sanctions, cover the growing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, present you with the most recent reports, legislation & guides, and finally wrap up this week’s Roundup by reviewing the latest news from the world of money laundering. ### **What exactly is Web3?** Web3 isn’t yet fully in existence, so nobody knows exactly how it will work. But most concepts involve the blockchain, an unchangeable ledger system used by cryptocurrencies to keep track of transactions. Some believe that [Web3](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/web3-definition-internet.html) is little more than a rebranding exercise for crypto, others believe it’s a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet, in which every activity and social interaction can be bought and sold. ### **Can a blockchain-based decentralised internet change the world?** The appeal of the blockchain for Web3 supporters is that it logs everything in a way that is transparent and impossible to edit or falsify; each new transaction creates a “block” in the ledger anyone can see. The main issue of the blockchain is the same as its supposed benefit, as nobody can edit the ledger, and anyone can create as many crypto accounts as they want, it’s hard to [address and protect against fraud](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-web3-5271876). ### **Webinar: Experts Take on FinCrime: Web3 and Digital Assets** While Web3 and digital assets have the potential to benefit society, cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols are a central tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. At this upcoming [webinar](https://www.napier.ai/post/web3-financial-risk-compliance) (Wednesday, September 21st, 2022 @ 9:30 am BST) experts from law enforcement and technology vendors will discuss the digital asset ecosystem as it relates to financial crime. ### **Helium: an example of Web3 in action today** [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is a crowdsourced wireless network that rewards users with cryptocurrency for sharing their home network connections. This effectively creates a large network of hotspots that users can access, while the owners of those hotspots can receive compensation in the form of crypto tokens. ### **Crawley Town Football club: The “transformative sports success story of Web 3.0”** While traditional finance was used in the initial purchase of Crawley Town football club, its owners are now harnessing [digital currencies to build a remote community of fans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62136553). In July, Crawley launched their own NFT and for the price of 0.35 Ether (worth £353 at the time of publication) buyers received ‘a virtual season ticket’. ## Money Laundering, Fraud & Corruption ### **Malta-based bank fined for anti-money laundering breaches** A Malta-based bank owned by a Dutch billionaire has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for some [major shortcomings in its anti-money laundering processes](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/bank-owned-dutch-billionaire-fined-antimoney-laundering-breaches.978758). Novum Bank, owned by Dutch entrepreneur Marcel Boekhoorn, was hit with an €89,000 fine and ordered to tighten up its checks on clients. ### **Opinion: call for a European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime** The increasing complexity of EU financial and anti-financial crime regulation has made it increasingly difficult for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) to keep up with regulatory developments. This has led to growing calls for the establishment of a [European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/need-european-centre-excellence-antimoney-laundering-compliance.979691) to provide training and guidance, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. ### **Report: The biggest money laundering risks must be given top priority** De Nederlandsche Bank has published a [report on preventing and combating financial crime](https://www.dnb.nl/en/general-news/2022/biggest-money-laundering-risks-must-be-given-top-priority/). Entitled ‘From recovery to balance’, it argues for more risk-based customer due diligence and recommends focussing on the high-risk customer categories. ### **Money laundering through Payment Gateways and Buy Now Pay Later schemes** The Covid-19 pandemic threw India’s economy into chaos and Chinese scammers took advantage by flooding the market with legitimate-looking micro-loan and betting apps, which they turned out to be scandalous and robbed thousands of users of their money. Many companies are now facing scrutiny as their [due-diligence methods failed](https://regtechtimes.com/money-laundering-through-payment-gateway/) to prevent transactions with fraudulent merchants. ### **Regulator details “Frankly shocking” AML breaches at Sydney casino** Star Entertainment Group, Australia’s second biggest operator, has been found unfit to hold a casino licence in Sydney. An inquiry by Australia’s New South Wales state gambling regulator into alleged [breaches of anti-money laundering laws and criminal infiltration](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-state-regulator-says-star-unfit-hold-casino-licence-2022-09-13/), identified “systemic governance, risk and cultural failures”. ### **Webinar: Money laundering through the property sector: Headline cases in review** While the property sector has faced increasingly stringent anti-money laundering regulations across the globe, often these regulations are poorly enforced. Public records can go a long way toward flagging and investigating suspicious real estate transactions, particularly when records are centralised, networked, and searchable. Join this webinar on September 28 at 1pm ET for a discussion on money laundering in the real estate market and examples of how to trace nefarious actors’ real estate assets in Sayari Graph. ## Legislation, Regulation and Sustainability ### **Report: FATF and INTERPOL intensify global asset recovery** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and INTERPOL have launched a [joint initiative](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/methodsandtrends/documents/fatf-interpol-2022.html) to increase global efforts to recover illicit assets. While asset recovery is key to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, it is estimated that countries intercept and recover less than one per cent of global illicit financial flows. ### **FATF Report: Japan strengthens measures to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing** Since the 2021 assessment, Japan has taken several actions to strengthen its framework. As a result, the FATF has [re-rated the country](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fur-japan-2022.html) on Recommendation 2 from Partially Compliant to Largely Compliant. Japan is now compliant on 4 Recommendations, largely compliant on 25, and partially compliant on 9 Recommendations. Japan will remain in enhanced follow up and will continue to inform the FATF of its progress. ### **Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry on illicit finance – evidence deadline 27 September** The deadline for submissions of initial written evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee’s ‘[Responding to illicit and emerging finance](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6495/)’ inquiry has been extended to Tuesday 27 Sept 2022. The inquiry, announced on 1 Feb 2022, will assess the effectiveness of the UK’s response to the challenge of cross-border illicit finance and builds on the “Moscow’s Gold” report. ### **FCA calls on the financial industries to ‘embed’ the use of data and technology** An executive director of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has called on the financial industries to [‘embed’ the use of data and technology](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fighting-financial-crime-force-multiplier-effect) in order to ward off financial crime. Speaking at The Financial Crime Summit, Sarah Pritchard warned that financial crime would worsen in light of the cost-of-living crisis and advised firms to plan how they will respond to the increased risks. “My message to all firms is this: embed your financial crime checks in your systems from day one, but keep evolving as the threats evolve,” she said. “Use the power of data and tech, and stay alert for situations in which you may need to recalibrate your defences and alerts.” Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets, FCA ### **Quick Guide: Money laundering through the gambling industry** The Basel Institute on Governance has published a quick [guide](https://baselgovernance.org/publications/quick-guide-28-money-laundering-through-gambling-industry) which sets out how criminals abuse the gambling industry to launder illicit funds. It includes case studies to illustrate the different ways criminals launder money in casinos, online gambling websites, bars and clubs, as well as physical and online sports betting services. The guide also explores what gambling businesses and public authorities can do to better prevent and detect money laundering in this sector. ### **Dekleptification guide: Seizing windows of opportunity to dismantle kleptocracy** This [guide](https://civil.ge/archives/507589) was created as a resource for USAID staff working in countries mired in severe corruption, particularly those whose courageous citizens open windows of opportunity for reform. It also aims to set the agenda for the broader community of donors, implementing partners, scholars, and other experts who are focussed on countering kleptocracy and corruption. ### **OCCRP publishes a ‘Follow the Money’ handbook in Spanish** OCCRP has released “¡Sigan el dinero!” (Follow the Money). This free Spanish-language handbook is available [here](https://id.occrp.org/) and contains tools, instructions, and tips on how to find records and databases in 19 Latin American countries, as well as in the US, Belize, and the British Virgin Islands, which are prime havens for stolen money. ### **Singapore: Strengthening AML/CFT practices for external asset managers** The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has published an [information paper](https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2022/strengthening-amlcft-practices-for-external-asset-managers) which sets out supervisory expectations for effective AML/CFT frameworks and controls, together with good practices and illustrative examples observed. ### **Video: A whistleblower’s greenwashing allegations and their impact** Desiree Fixler was fired from her position as head of sustainability at German asset manager DWS. Her dismissal came after she warned the company it was [overstating its sustainable investment credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8TzL5-pSYo). While DWS has always denied Fixler’s allegations, her public statements have sparked official investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. “This whole saga culminating in this police raid, is the wake-up call for the ESG market. A sustainability officer is not a marketing officer, a sustainability officer should be considered a compliance officer.” Desiree Fixler, former DWS Sustainability Officer ### **New Royal warrants will require proof of commitment to sustainability and the environment** Cadbury and Heinz are among around 800 firms who will have to re-apply for a Royal Warrant after the prestigious label became void following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and will be required to demonstrate that they have an appropriate [environmental and sustainability policy and action plan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62891159). ### **ESG policies should take note of the consequences of illegal wildlife trade and poaching** The Illegal wildlife trade has [far-reaching consequences](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/consequences-of-illegal-wildlife-trade/) and impacts society not just through loss of biodiversity, but the emergence of new virus diseases, economic decline, and leads to violence and other criminal activities. ## Crypto & Virtual Assets **Into the Metaverse: Risks and Rewards** Financial services firms are increasingly exploring how they can use the metaverse to provide new products and services to customers. As with the adoption of any new technology, this presents a series of risks and challenges. There is also a connection between the metaverse and Web3 as various items inside the metaverse could be NFTs, such as an avatar or virtual real estate. **Why cryptocurrencies remain of interest to criminals** In recent times cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have become easier to trace, major darknet platforms have been taken down by law enforcement, and internal financial crime investigation units have upgraded their technological financial crime prevention solutions. Yet the amount that is [connected to illicit activity](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/why-cryptocurrencies-are-interesting-for-criminals/) still accounts for more than the authorities would like. **Europol sees the tools to tackle crime in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies** Europol has acknowledged that while abuse increases with use in the case of cryptocurrency, it also noted that blockchain technologies offer authorities a new opportunity to fight crime', summary='Date: 2022-09-16 | Source: KYC360 Weekly Roundup | Legal Status: N/A | Article discusses general trends and issues in AML, Web3, cryptocurrencies, and financial crime risks but contains no specific information related to Lukoil’s financial crimes, AML violations, sanctions breaches, or compliance actions.', hyde_score=0.51),\n",

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

The seizure follows an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston, FBI Houston, and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security into alleged violations of U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The aircraft reportedly flew into and out of Russia in violation of Department of Commerce export controls and license requirements restricting U.S.-manufactured aircraft transfers to Russia without authorization. The ownership of the aircraft was obscured through a series of shell companies. LUKOIL has been subject to sectoral sanctions by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) since 2014. The seizure action is coordinated by the Department of Justice’s Task Force KleptoCapture, focused on enforcing sanctions and export controls related to Russia. The investigation into additional aircraft remains ongoing. No charges or convictions have been reported at this time.', hyde_score=0.5),\n",

It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements, the enforcement of them, and circumstances where they do not apply. This guidance is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct you to further detailed guidance to read alongside it. This document is current on the date of publication. 1. Prohibitions and requirements --------------------------------- The regulations impose financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging Russia to cease actions which destabilise Ukraine, or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. The prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons include British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas. The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 10 of the regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters. It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions. If you are unclear about any aspect of the regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice. Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the regulations are set out below. 1.1 Non-government controlled territory of Ukraine --------------------------------------------------- The territorial scope of certain measures in the regulations is ‘non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’. This is defined in regulation 2 as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts’. ‘Crimea’ is further defined as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. 1.2 Designation of persons --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of the financial and/or director disqualification and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions if they are, or have been, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in [regulation 6 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6)). The regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the purposes of the financial and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) provides details of the people designated under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated. 1.3 Specification of ships --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may specify a ship for the purposes of shipping sanctions if the ship is, has been, or is likely to be, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 57F of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)). The regulations also provide that the Secretary of State must specify a ship by its International Maritime Organization number or, where it is not reasonably practicable to identify it by that number, by any other means that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list)provides details of the ships specified under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been specified. #### The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations 2024 These [regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/made) came into force on 31 July 2024. They amend regulation 57F (specification of ships) so that a ship may be specified for any activity whose object or effect is to: * destabilise Ukraine or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine, or to * obtain a benefit from or support the Government of Russia This includes, but is not limited to, carrying military or dual-use goods from a third country to Russia, as well as oil or oil products that originated in Russia. Ships specified under Regulation 57F will be subject to ‘shipping sanctions’, namely measures in regulations 57A to 57E. Where shipping sanctions apply, a specified ship: * is prohibited from entering a port in the UK * may be given a movement or a port entry direction * can be detained, and * will be refused permission to register on the UK Ship Register or have its existing registration terminated These regulations also amend regulation 6 (designation criteria) to include additional activities for which a person may designated, namely: * providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology to persons involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia (as defined in the Regulations); and * owning or controlling directly or indirectly, or working as a director, trustee, other manager or equivalent of a person, other than an individual, involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine The former expands the criteria under the Regulations to designate entities, including foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions on behalf of, or in support of, specified sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. This in line with G7 commitments to further curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system which Russia is using to facilitate its war in Ukraine. An [explanatory memorandum](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/memorandum/contents) accompanies the regulations, providing further information on their provisions. 1.4 Financial sanctions ------------------------ #### Asset freeze and making available provisions The regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly. These prohibitions also apply in relation to entities owned or controlled by a designated person. The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is the authority for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury. OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. See more information about [how OFSI implements financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-financial-sanctions-guidance). #### Other financial and investment restrictions The regulations prohibit a person from directly or', summary='Date: 2025-07-22 | Source: GOV.UK | Article discusses UK government statutory guidance on Russia sanctions, including financial sanctions enforcement, licensing, and compliance requirements.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897). [For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list). See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Specifically, Eduard Benderskiy, a former FSB officer and father-in-law of Evil Corp leader Maksim Yakubets, was sanctioned for materially assisting Evil Corp and acting on behalf of the Russian government. Benderskiy’s private security firm provided security services for Lukoil facilities in Iraq around 2017. OFAC designated Benderskiy and his companies Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to Executive Orders 14024 and 13694 for supporting Evil Corp activities. While no direct allegations or investigations of Lukoil itself for financial crimes, AML deficiencies, or sanctions violations are stated, the involvement of a security firm linked to Lukoil’s operations with a sanctioned individual raises potential reputational and compliance risks. No charges, fines, or enforcement actions against Lukoil were reported. No information on Lukoil’s AML program or compliance measures provided.

Pleads Guilty to International Bribery Scheme ================================================================================= Thursday, August 22, 2024 **For Immediate Release** Office of Public Affairs A former energy trader pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to bribe Mexican government officials to secure contracts for his then-employer, Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S.affiliate of the largest independent energy trading firm in the world. According to court documents, Javier Aguilar, 50, of Houston, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PEMEX Procurement International, Inc. (PPI), a wholly owned affiliate of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), in exchange for assistance in winning business for Vitol. “Javier Aguilar has now admitted that he bribed foreign officials to win business when he worked as an oil and gas trader at Vitol Inc., using shell companies, fake contracts, sham invoices, and alias email accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Aguilar’s guilty plea yesterday follows his conviction at trial on related charges earlier this year. His illegal conduct netted Vitol hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, and now he will pay the price.” “With yesterday\\'s guilty plea, the defendant admits his role in the widespread corruption of the international commodities market and to casting aside laws and rules that apply to all to unfairly line the pockets of the few,” said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. “The actions of the defendant and his co-conspirators, and of those who act similarly, destroy people’s faith in their governments, disadvantage those who play by the rules, undermine confidence in American businesses worldwide, and will not be tolerated by this Office or our law enforcement partners.” “The Southern District of Texas is ground zero in the fight against foreign bribery and corruption in Latin America,” said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. “My office’s prosecutors — experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — will continue to bring to justice those who damage the integrity of Texas’s vital energy sector with illegal advantages fueled by greed. This guilty plea begins the process of repairing the damage caused by Aguilar as well as putting on notice those who might seek to emulate him and his cohorts.” “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been the law of the land, and enforceable worldwide, for decades. Yet unscrupulous businessmen still try to bribe their way to profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. “My message to them is that the charges and penalties you will face are not worth the gain. I want to commend the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Office of International Affairs; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas for their diligence pursuing this case, but especially the agents and analysts who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of FCPA violators.” Between 2017 and 2020, Aguilar, who was a trader in Vitol’s Houston office, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PPI to obtain numerous contracts for Vitol to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of ethane to PEMEX. To conceal the scheme, Aguilar and his co-conspirators used a series of fake contracts, sham invoices and shell entities incorporated in Curaçao and Mexico. The defendant and his co-conspirators also used alias email accounts to communicate about the scheme and code words, including “shoes,” “medicine,” “invitations,” and “coffee,” to describe the bribes. Aguilar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to a violation of the Travel Act. The FCPA conspiracy charge, which was brought by a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas, related to conduct that was initially charged in the Eastern District of New York. As part of his guilty plea, Aguilar consented to transfer the Texas case to New York, to consolidate the cases, and to forfeit $7,129,938. The plea follows Aguilar’s related [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-oil-and-gas-trader-convicted-role-foreign-bribery-and-money-laundering-scheme) at trial in February 2024 for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, violating the FCPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with schemes to bribe Ecuadorian and Mexican officials. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment on the money laundering offense and five years’ imprisonment on each of the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. In December 2020, Vitol [admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/vitol-inc-agrees-pay-over-135-million-resolve-foreign-bribery-case) to bribing officials in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S.Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York. As a part of the resolution, Vitol agreed to pay a combined $135 million in penalties as part of a coordinated resolution with the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and authorities in Brazil. Seven of the defendant’s co-conspirators have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing. These individuals have agreed to forfeit more than $63 million in connection with this and related schemes. FBI Miami’s International Corruption Squad investigated the case. Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan P. Lax, Matthew R. Galeotti, and Nick M. Axelrod for the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sherin Daniel and Deputy Chief Suzanne Elmilady for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The MLARS Special Financial Investigations Unit and Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance. The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at[www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa). The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to [kleptocracy@usdoj.gov](mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov)or[https://tips.fbi.gov/](https://tips.fbi.gov/).

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison». Dans le «lobby», beaucoup de gens parlent russe. «C’est un peu la nouvelle rue du Rhône en beaucoup plus moderne», estime un acteur du secteur qui, lui, est toujours\", summary='Date: 2023-11-21 | Source: Public Eye | Legal Status: No direct allegations or findings | Article reports that since Western sanctions and embargoes on Russian oil (effective December 2022 for crude and February 2023 for refined products), Dubai’s DMCC free zone has become a preferred hub for trading Russian oil, attracting many companies formerly operating from Switzerland.

Hafeez](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/sahar-hafeez.html) [Samantha Franks](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/) Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-partnering-cross-agency-trade-fraud-task-force) the launch of a “cross-agency” Trade Fraud Task Force “to bring robust enforcement against importers and other parties who seek to defraud the United States.” According to DOJ, the Task Force will “augment the existing coordination mechanisms” within DOJ and leverage expertise from DOJ’s Civil and Criminal Divisions and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against any parties who seek to evade tariffs and other duties, as well as smugglers who seek to import prohibited goods into the American economy.” The Task Force announcement occurs against the backdrop of [intensified tariff activity](https://www.globaltradeandsanctionslaw.com/snapshot-of-current-tariff-actions-and-negotiations/), including reciprocal tariffs on nearly every trading partner, and [investigations on imports of critical materials](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/section-232-pharma-semiconductors-crit-minerals-trucks.html) from semiconductors to metals and minerals and pharmaceuticals under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. While statutes such as the False Claims Act (FCA) have occasionally predicated trade-related actions in the past, the Task Force represents a concerted effort by the U.S. government to bring greater resources, statutory authorities and prosecutorial power to bear on alleged customs violations. The Task Force is expected to promote coordination between DOJ and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to target evasion schemes, including false origin declarations, misclassification, fraudulent under-valuations and other alleged violations that undermine tariff policy and deprive the Government of tariff revenue. As discussed further below, this will likely include not only traditional CBP civil penalty enforcement but also civil *and* criminal actions under the FCA and statutes such as wire fraud, importing through false statements, and conspiracy. For importers, this dual pressure—policy expansion coupled with enforcement escalation—creates a complex compliance environment. While the announcement provides important information about how the Task Force will operate, importers and related businesses should stay attuned to the broader trade enforcement context and the open questions that remain in order to assess and mitigate their own risk. At the end of this piece we offer discrete recommendations, including audit and supply chain compliance that incorporates increased risk of DOJ involvement and FCA claims; internal and external reporting mechanisms for potential violations, from both companies and their competitors; and monitoring fast-moving legislative, judicial and regulatory developments that can impact import compliance. **How the Task Force Will Operate** On the personnel front, the Task Force will consist of litigators from the Criminal and Civil Divisions at DOJ. From the Criminal Division, the Task Force will include prosecutors from the Fraud Section’s newly established [Market, Government, and Consumer Fraud Unit](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/mgc-unit). Within the Civil Division, the announcement indicates the Task Force will be supported by members of the Commercial Litigation Branch’s Civil Fraud Section (which conducts False Claims Act enforcement) and National Courts Section (which has responsibility for civil customs fraud actions). According to the announcement, attorneys on the Task Force “will work closely with” investigators from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which are both part of DHS. As for strategy, DOJ’s announcement anchors the Task Force in the “America First Trade Policy” Presidential Memorandum (Jan. 20, 2025) and Executive Order 14243, “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos” (Mar. 20, 2025). According to DOJ, the Task Force will advance these policies by pursuing: (a) customs laws violations through duty and penalty collection actions under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Tariff Act”); (b) civil actions under the False Claims Act; and (c) parallel criminal prosecutions, penalties and seizures under Title 18’s trade fraud and conspiracy provisions. CBP enforces the civil penalty provisions of section 592 the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1592. Under the customs law, importers are held to a standard of reasonable care, which requires that importers exercise diligence to make accurate declarations regarding the classification, valuation, country of origin and applicable duty rates for imported merchandise. Section 1592(a) provides that “no person, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, may enter, introduce, or attempt to enter any merchandise” into U.S. commerce by means of a material misrepresentation or omission, or aid and abet such a violation. Where CBP has reasonable cause to believe an importer has violated section 1592, it may issue a written penalty notice seeking liquidated damages. Liquidated damages can range from a civil penalty of up to twice the duties owed (for negligence), to the full domestic value of the merchandise (for fraud)—though, after receiving a penalty notice, importers have the opportunity to seek mitigation of monetary penalties under the customs regulations, 19 C.F.R. Part 171. In addition to seeking civil monetary penalties under the Tariff Act, the Task Force announcement also reaffirms that DOJ will rely on other enforcement tools like the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729. The FCA has been called the government’s “[most powerful tool](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/March/159dag.htm)” for combatting fraud against the United States. Although the DOJ has not often used the FCA to bring trade fraud enforcement actions, the Ninth Circuit has [recently held](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/06/23/22-55063.pdf) that false claims can include not only fraudulent requests for payment but also evasion of obligations to pay customs duties otherwise owed to the government. And, in addition to per-violation civil penalties, the FCA authorizes courts to impose treble damages, which means that knowing violators could end up paying three times the amount of duties owed. Finally, a trade fraud investigation may implicate a number of criminal offenses in Title 18 of the United States Code, including sections 287 (criminal false claims), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 541 (false classification of goods), 542 (importing through false statements), 545 (smuggling), 1001 (false statements to government officials), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1349 (attempt and conspiracy to commit fraud), 1956 (money laundering), and 1957 (transactions in laundered funds). With the exception of sections 287 and 371, all of these offenses could give rise to criminal or civil forfeiture. That means, even absent a criminal conviction, DOJ could file a civil complaint, with a lower burden of proof, that seeks to forfeit the proceeds of trade fraud, a forfeiture money judgment in the same amount, or—in the case of money laundering—any property involved in a transaction with laundered funds. **The Broader Context** Prosecuting trade fraud is not new to DOJ. As the announcement recognizes, the Civil Division has resolved a number of trade prosecutions in 2025. Nor is the idea of a Trade Fraud Task Force new to the Department. As recently as March 2024, DOJ [praised](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ford-motor-company-agrees-pay-365m-settle-customs-civil-penalty-claims-relating) the work of a “Trade Fraud Task Force” in supporting a $365 million settlement with Ford Motor Company to resolve allegations that it violated the Tariff Act of 1930 by misclassifying and undervaluing hundreds of thousands of cargo vans imported from Turkey. Nonetheless, the 2025 version of the Task Force merits serious attention. First, DOJ has formally added the Criminal Division and HSI to the Task Force. The involvement of prosecutors and criminal investigators is likely to increase the number of trade fraud investigations, if not enforcement actions. Second, trade fraud prosecutions are being prioritized in a way they were not previously. That sends a message to agents and prosecutors that trade fraud cases are more likely to get leadership and press attention, which could incentivize working on Task Force matters instead of other investigations. Third, the Task Force announcement expressly encourages relators to alert the government to credible allegations of trade fraud by utilizing the FCA’s *qui* *tam* provisions to file sealed complaints on behalf of the United States. While *qui tam* complaints have long been an avenue for reporting fraud, the DOJ’s express receptiveness to reviewing and potentially acting on trade fraud complaints is new and likely to yield more such reports from an increasingly active relator-side bar. The addition of the Criminal Division to the Task Force is also significant. Trade penalties in the customs arena, including under the Tariff Act, have historically involved civil monetary penalties. Recent policy changes, however, increase the likelihood that trade fraud allegations and investigations develop into criminal prosecutions. In May 2025, the Division [expanded](http://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/140004) the scope of offenses that are eligible for its Corporate Whistleblower Awards Pilot Program to include corporate violations relating to trade, tariff and customs fraud. On September 16, 2025, the Criminal Division’s Acting Assistant Attorney General, Matthew R. Galeotti, [disclosed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-association) that, in the past four months, the Division received 313 whistleblower tips and that 120 of them—including tips relating to trade fraud—warranted further investigation. Also in May, the Division announced that it had [revised](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400031) its Corporate Enforcement Policy (CEP) to further encourage companies to voluntarily self-disclose misconduct—including misconduct relating to trade fraud. Under the revised CEP, absent aggravating circumstances, a company that voluntarily self-discloses, fully cooperates and remediates, and pays all forfeiture and restitution is *entitled* to a declination rather than a *presumption* of a declination. This is significant because the Tariff Act itself provides a mechanism for “prior disclosure,” which allows importers to disclose potential past violations to avoid more exacting monetary penalties. Accordingly, importers considering a prior disclosure to CBP should now also consult with counsel about making a voluntary self-disclosure under the Criminal Division’s CEP. **Unresolved Questions** Notwithstanding the information provided by DOJ about the new Task Force, a number of questions remain. The announcement did not include certain operational details, such as where within DOJ the Task Force will reside, who will lead its day-to-day work, or whether the Task Force will report on its activities beyond press releases describing individual cases. The announcement also did not indicate whether the Task Force will benefit from the allocation of any dedicated resources, whether agents or attorneys. A/AAG Galeotti did, however, recently [announce](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-global) that the Criminal Division would be “leading” DOJ’s effort to investigate and prosecute trade fraud, with a “particular focus” on cases involving (1) “long-running efforts to evade hundreds of millions in tariffs, including tariffs on Chinese products,” and (2) trade fraud schemes involving corporate executives. Some of the open questions may be answered through pending legislation. For example, legislators in the House’s Select Committee on the Chinese Community Party have reintroduced the bipartisan [Protecting American Industry and Labor from International Trade Crimes Act](https://mcusercontent.com/ffedde7e54b71a41a9505fff1/files/893afae6-3edc-b4f7-15a7-50a9afa42c35/HINSON_010_xml.pdf). Among other things, the Act would require the Criminal Division to establish a task force to prosecute trade crimes, and appropriate $20 million for the Division to hire and train prosecutors and investigators and conduct enforcement actions. Depending on the mix of attorneys, investigators and staff, this could result in the addition of as many as 50 to 60 personnel to the Task Force, and the more dedicated resources that are assigned to the Task Force, the more enforcement activity that can be expected. Congress may influence trade fraud prosecutions in other ways. For example, the Chairman of China Select Committee recently sent a [letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/) asking the agency to investigate an importer over the evasion of steep tariffs on Chinese goods—highlighting that Congress has also turned its attention to issues such as misclassification or transshipment of merchandise. Other questions may be addressed by the Supreme Court. On November 5, the Court will hear the U.S. government’s appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision in *V.O.S. Selections v. Trump*, which held that the President lacked the authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose reciprocal tariffs and the so-called “fentanyl” tariffs. Even if the Supreme Court allows the lower court ruling invalidating these tariffs to stand, many tariffs will remain in place, including tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles under Section 232, tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 imposed on China during President Trump’s first term, and antidumping and countervailing', summary='Date: 2025-06-30 (approximate, based on article context) | Source: Global Trade & Sanctions Law (Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP) | Legal Status: No specific Lukoil-related allegations or investigations reported | Article discusses the launch of the U.S. DOJ’s new cross-agency Trade Fraud Task Force aimed at combating trade-related fraud, including customs violations, tariff evasion, and false claims under statutes such as the False Claims Act and criminal provisions in Title 18.

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

на 1,7 млрд долларов.** Согласно [информации](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/seven-members-moscow-based-criminal-organization-plead-guilty-over-17-billion) Офиса прокурора США в Восточном округе Нью-Йорка, семь членов организованной преступной группировки, находящейся в Москве, признаны виновными в схеме по организации масштабной международной схемы мошенничества в сфере медицины и отмывании денег: они выставили поддельные счета более 50 аптекам на сумму свыше 1,7 миллиардов долларов. Сообщники действовали по всей стране, включая Нью-Йорк, Бруклин, Лонг-Айленд, Статен-Айленд, Нью-Джерси, Техас и др. Лидер группы, гражданин США Брайн Саттон, 31 год, находящийся в Москве, управлял преступной деятельностью из российской столицы, он остается на свободе. Среди обвиняемых значатся: Хафизула Эбади, Джошуа Мануэль Алегрия, Дэвид Гэри Бишофф, Брайсен Кей Миллетт, Дела Сайдазим, Энтони Сантамария и Хершель Цикман, они признали себя виновными. Ответчики участвовали в международной схеме по приобретению аптек по всей территории Соединенных Штатов, имея ранее существовавшие отношения с частными компаниями медицинского страхования. Эти аптеки вместе с колл-центрами использовались, чтобы побудить людей принимать ненужные лекарства, для чего выписывались мошеннические рецепты в аптеках схемы — на этом сеть нанятых врачей и обвиняемые заработали более 1,7 миллиарда долларов. Обвинения против Саттона и других были объявлены 7 ноября 2023 года. Следствие выяснило, что преступная группа выставила мошеннические счета в период с 2017 по 2022 год. Сообщники Саттона обеспечивали поиск аптек, врачей и открытие колл-центров, первые из которых открылись в штате Юта, а вскоре сеть расширилась в другие страны, включая Россию. Сотрудники колл-центров звонили клиентам с предложением купить лекарства по низкой цене без предварительного медобследования. Практикующие медсестры и помощники врачей выписывали рецепты после телемедицинских консультаций, зачастую обманывая врачей о проведении этих визитов, которые фактически не осуществлялись. Рецепты оформлялись на имена врачей и номера их идентификаторов, в результате чего многие бенефициары так и не получили обещанные медикаменты. Для отмывания денег мошенники использовали подставные компании, а также вымышленные персональные данные и средства связи. В преступной группе работали IT-специалисты, которые настраивали программное обеспечение для управления аптечной сетью. Они подготавливали и подавали заявки на возмещение «расходов» в частные страховые компании. В итоге преступникам удалось получить от страховых компаний свыше $500 миллионов. Сроки тюремного заключения, которые грозят членам преступной группы, варьируются от 10 до 30 лет, в то время как некоторым простоит конфискация имущества и штрафы в размере от 1,8 до 520 миллионов долларов. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/10/29/members-of-moscow-criminal-organization-guilty/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Legal Status: No financial crime or compliance information found | Article and website content reviewed contain no information related to money laundering allegations, AML deficiencies, sanctions violations, fraud, corruption, or compliance actions involving Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.4),\n",

Об этом [пишет](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chen-zhi-scam-singapore-police-b2859031.html) Independent. В середине октября 2025 года прокуратура США предъявила предпринимателю обвинения в сговоре с целью мошенничества с использованием электронных средств связи и в сговоре с целью отмывания денег. Как следует из обвинительного заключения, жертвами злоумышленников под эгидой Prince Holding Group стали 250 человек на территории США. В рамках расследования американские власти изъяли биткоинов более чем на $14 млрд. Одновременно власти Великобритании объявили об аресте в Северном Лондоне особняка стоимостью $15,6 млн и офисного здания за $130 млн. Правительства США и Великобритании также ввели совместные санкции против Чжи и его компании. [Российского криптомошенника Пичугина депортируют из Камбоджи](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/68a599ce9a79470187bbf88f) [Общество](https://www.rbc.ru/society/) Затем к расследованию присоединился Сингапур. Местные силовики арестовали финансовые активы Чэня на $114 млн, а также несколько яхт с коллекцией дорогостоящего алкоголя. Четвертого ноября тайваньская прокуратура задержала по делу Чэня 25 подозреваемых и конфисковала у камбоджийского бизнесмена активы на сумму $150 млн. В тот же день полиция Гонконга объявила об изъятии активов Чэня Чжи в виде наличных и акций еще на $353 млн. Prince Holding Group — камбоджийский конгломерат со штаб-квартирой в Пномпене и с дочерними компаниями в десятках стран. У холдинга интересы в разных сферах — недвижимость, финансы, авиация, туризм, логистика, высокие технологии и пищевая промышленность. [На сайте компании](https://www.princeholdinggroup.com/) указано, что она является одним из крупнейших конгломератов Камбоджи. 38-летний Чэнь Чжи, помимо камбоджийского паспорта, имеет гражданство Китая, где он родился. Как выяснило [Associated Press](http://www.ap.org/), Чэнь все еще [остается на свободе](https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-us-uk-online-scam-prince-chen-zhi-bbc3fae393003a16cda22efd5a2ada22). В случае признания его виновным в США ему грозит до 40 лет тюрьмы.

По данным ФБР, Семёнов, являясь экспертом в области блокчейн-технологий, использовал свои навыки для разработки криптовалютного миксера Tornado Cash. Сервис, изначально позиционировавшийся как инструмент для обеспечения анонимности транзакций, на практике превратился в крупный механизм по отмыванию денег. Через [Tornado Cash](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=Tornado+Cash) было отмыто более 1 миллиарда долларов преступных доходов. Как предполагает ФБР, в апреле и мае 2022 года сервис Tornado Cash предположительно использовался Lazarus Group, северокорейской организацией по киберпреступности, находящейся под санкциями, для отмывания сотен миллионов долларов доходов. Семенов и его сообщники якобы знали, что сервис Tornado Cash, которым они управляли, участвовал в этих нарушающих санкции транзакциях. Они якобы продолжали управлять сервисом и способствовать проведению сотен миллионов долларов, помогая Lazarus Group переводить преступные доходы с криптовалютного кошелька, который был обозначен Управлением по контролю за иностранными активами как заблокированное имущество. 21 августа 2023 года федеральный суд США выдал ордер на арест Семёнова. Ему предъявлены обвинения в сговоре с целью отмывания денег, ведении нелицензированного бизнеса по переводу денежных средств и нарушении Закона о международных чрезвычайных экономических полномочиях. В настоящее время местонахождение Семёнова неизвестно: он может находиться в России, Турции или Объединенных Арабских Эмиратах — в этих странах у него есть установленные связи.

Его заподозрили в коррупции и отмывании денег, сообщает The Guardian, ссылаясь на документы федерального уголовного суда Швейцарии. Следствие, согласно документам, пытается установить происхождение состояния Абрамовича, которое он приобрел в России в 1990-х и 2000-х годах. Среди прочего власти острова в рамках расследования запросили данные о счетах в швейцарских банках, которые связывают с бизнесменом. Суд в Швейцарии, несмотря на попытки адвокатов Абрамовича заблокировать обмен документами, постановил, что эту информацию можно передать властям Джерси. Один запрос касается подозрений в отмывании денег, полученных Абрамовичем при продаже компании «Сибнефть» за 13 миллиардов долларов в 2005 году. Второе дело связано с возможным нарушением санкций из-за переводов, совершенных после того, как бизнесмена включили в санкционный список острова Джерси в 2022 году. Абрамович через своих адвокатов отверг все обвинения и заявил, что любые предположения о его причастности к преступной деятельности не соответствуют действительности. Власти острова Джерси весной 2022 года [заблокировали](https://meduza.io/news/2022/04/13/sud-ostrova-dzhersi-zamorozil-aktivy-romana-abramovicha-na-7-milliardov-dollarov) активы Романа Абрамовича на семь миллиардов долларов, сообщал Bloomberg. Это произошло вскоре после того, как власти Евросоюза и Великобритании ввели санкции против бизнесмена из-за полномасштабного вторжения войск России в Украину. Журнал Forbes [оценивает](https://www.forbes.ru/profile/roman-abramovich) состояние Абрамовича в 9,2 миллиарда долларов.

Свои предложения он опубликовал в [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid023LmPDPQUpAEQJtKNy6Ex6Lr6sPS3CorrgwMhZgBcurhmDddjmftJvpJ76urEi7obl&id=100075452118676&locale=ru_RU), сообщает [Orda.kz](orda.kz).** Марат Башимов рассказал, что направил письмо с предложениями генпрокурору Берику Асылову. Депутат хочет не просто вернуть государству выведенные за рубеж деньги, но и провести «расширенную конфискацию». По словам депутата, во многих странах учли рекомендации ФАТФ и внесли соответствующие изменения в законодательство. Раньше принять такие законы было невозможно из-за активного противостояния лоббистов, но сейчас это сделать необходимо, считает Башимов. Казахстан не полностью ратифицировал конвенцию ООН по борьбе с коррупцией, но всё равно является её участником — а это значит, что страна должна бороться с незаконным обогащением не только чиновников, но и членов их семей. > «Сейчас из-за того, что этой нормы нет, и активы переписаны на третьих лиц, многие уходят от ответственности, их имущество не конфискуется в полном объёме, а осуждённый «сидит» спокойно, зная, что у него не забрали то, что переписано на третьих лиц, родственников, любовниц и так далее. И этими активами и деньгами он завтра будет наслаждаться».Марат Башимов Мажилисмен указывает: в законодательстве есть понятие «имущество, приобретённое преступным путем». И оно относится в том числе к имуществу, которым владеют третьи лица. Например, члены семьи, сообщники по уголовным делам, аффилированные юрлица. Сюда же попадают активы, подаренные или за бесценок проданные «на сторону». > «При расширенной конфискации нет необходимости в отдельном судебном разбирательстве и вынесении обвинительного приговора в отношении предшествующей преступной деятельности, в результате которой предположительно были получены активы. Поскольку предполагаемая предшествующая преступная деятельность не нуждается в уточнении. Расширенную конфискацию можно применять лишь в отношении имущества, законность приобретения которого лицо объяснить не может. Механизм предлагается следующий: лицу, в отношении которого начато досудебное производство, предлагается доказать законность приобретения остального имущества. Если он не сможет доказать, то оно подлежит конфискации», — развивает свою мысль депутат. Марат Башимов уточнил, что расширенную конфискацию нужно применять не ко всем подряд — но в первую очередь под неё должны попадать отдельные категории госслужащих и политиков, а также те, кто работает на руководящих постах в госструктурах. Тем временем другие депутаты мажилиса, напротив, предложили [провести амнистию капиталов](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) — и простить казахстанским олигархам вывод денег из страны в обмен на их возвращение в родную экономику. **Читайте также:** * [Возврат активов: почему нельзя просто забрать элитную недвижимость казахстанцев в ОАЭ](https://orda.kz/vozvrat-aktivov-pochemu-nelzja-prosto-zabrat-jelitnuju-nedvizhimost-kazahstancev-v-oaje-399460/) * [Олигархи инвестируют 10,5 млрд долларов в экономику Казахстана](https://orda.kz/oligarhi-investirujut-105-mlrd-dollarov-v-jekonomiku-kazahstana-400481/) * [Понять и простить: казахстанским олигархам разрешат законно вернуть деньги в страну](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) [возврат активов](/tag/vozvrat-aktivov/) [казахстан](/tag/kazahstan/) [мажилис](/tag/mazhilis/) [марат башимов](/tag/marat-bashimov/) ## Лента новостей * [Токаев встретился с Госсекретарем США Марком Рубио и представителями администрации Дональда Трампа](/tokaev-vstretilsja-s-gossekretarem-ssha-markom-rubio-i-predstaviteljami-administracii-donalda-trampa-408811/) * [Что позволено женщине, то не позволено мужчине?

Dahinter verbarg sich einer der meistgesuchten Drogenbosse Europas. Nun stand eine der Frauen in Zürich vor Gericht. ![René Laglstorfer](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/3tw5IWneaKo8BIJbXh_YFL.jpg) ![Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/BLeGt9CK4FP9PcnTeZSeEt.jpg \"Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht\") Der Albtraum begann in den Ferien mit einem Anruf ihrer Enkelin im Juli 2022. «Fedpol und Kantonspolizei durchsuchen gerade dein Haus», sagte die junge Frau zu ihrer Grossmutter. «Ich bin komplett durch den Wind gewesen und habe gedacht: Spinnen die?», schildert die 63-Jährige. Die Frau ist langjährige Beizerin am Bodensee. 2013 hatte sie eine Firma gegründet, um in einer thurgauischen Seegemeinde ein Hotel zu bauen. Doch Investoren blieben aus, im November 2020 wollte die Beizerin die Firma wieder loswerden. «Ich habe meiner Treuhänderin Aida P. (Name geändert) eine Vollmacht gegeben, die Firma zu verkaufen, aber ich wusste nicht, an wen», sagt die Wirtin dieser Redaktion. Zurück aus den Ferien wurde die Frau zwei Stunden lang einvernommen. Polizisten hätten viele Fragen gestellt und ihr zig Blätter mit Namen darauf gezeigt, von denen sie niemanden gekannt habe. «Ich finde es verrückt, wie leicht man in so was hineingeraten kann», sagt die Beizerin. ## Dolder, Baur au Lac und Rüschlikon Rund fünf Monate vor dem scheinbar unbedeutenden Firmenverkauf waren der damals 33-jährige «Artur Gitta» und die 26-jährige «Simone Jung» als Touristen in die Schweiz eingereist. Für mehr als 75’000 Franken und mit gefälschten Reisepässen checkte das deutsche Paar im Juni 2020 für einen Monat im Zürcher Luxushotel Dolder ein. Es folgten zwei Wochen im Baur au Lac für rund 22’000 Franken, bis das offenbar wohlhabende Paar in einer Villa am See in Rüschlikon für monatlich 18’000 Franken eine feste Bleibe fand. ![Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/7U7oS4JR4Dc9sHOL49V5wV.jpg \"Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23\") Damit endete die jahrelange Flucht rund um den Globus von einem der meistgesuchten Kriminellen Europas: Denn hinter dem Namen «Artur Gitta» verbirgt sich der belgische Kokainkönig Flor Bressers, dessen Drogenkartell tonnenweise Rauschgift nach Europa geschmuggelt haben soll. «Simone Jung» wiederum ist die gefälschte Identität seiner holländischen Lebensgefährtin [Philomina Veenstra](/freundin-von-kokainkoenig-sass-monatelang-mit-baby-in-zuercher-gefaengnis-134865075326) (Name geändert). ## Familiengründung in der Schweiz 20 Monate lang, bis zu seiner [spektakulären Verhaftung](/belgischer-topverbrecher-von-zuercher-spezialeinheit-verhaftet-276783770429) im Februar 2022 in einer Luxuswohnung im Zürcher Renaissance-Tower, sollte Flor Bressers einen sicheren Hafen in der Schweiz haben. Von hier aus konnte der Kokainkönig unbehelligt sein internationales Drogenkartell lenken. So sicher muss er sich gefühlt haben, dass er in dieser Zeit mit seiner Freundin eine Familie gründete – ein Sohn kam in der Schweiz zur Welt. Das Paar führte ein Leben in Saus und Braus mit [Ausgaben in Millionenhöhe,](/das-unglaubliche-luxusleben-des-belgischen-kokainkoenigs-am-zuerichsee-184889075678) wie diese Redaktion zuerst berichtete. ## Flor Bressers findet einen Job Möglich gemacht haben das Luxusleben, finanziert aus dem internationalen Drogenhandel, am Zürichsee zahlreiche Helfer. Doch nicht alle dürften gewusst haben, wer sich hinter «Gitta» wirklich verbarg, wie Recherchen zeigen. ![Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/2gwpU9f1qKaA7utZtF82KO.jpg \"Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.\") Eine dieser Helferinnen ist die eingangs erwähnte Treuhänderin Aida P., die sich am Donnerstag wegen schwerer Geldwäscherei, Begünstigung und Täuschung der Behörden vor dem Bezirksgericht Zürich verantworten muss. Die Thurgauerin konnte den sichtlich wohlhabenden «Artur Gitta» spätestens Ende August 2020 – wenige Monate nach dessen Ankunft in der Schweiz – zu ihrem Kundenkreis zählen. ## «Anschein eines rechtschaffenen Bürgers» Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Aida P. vor, nicht nur einen Wohnsitz für «Gitta» und dessen Familie an der Zürcher Goldküste für einen maximalen Mietbetrag von monatlich 25’000 Franken gesucht zu haben. Die 36-Jährige soll ihm bereits Ende August zum Schein einen Arbeitsvertrag als Mitarbeiter in ihrem Treuhandbüro ausgestellt haben. «Die Idee war, unseren Kundenstamm über sein Netzwerk zu erweitern. Er wollte Neukunden bringen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. Als Wohnort gab sie dessen Adresse in einem Wohnblock im thurgauischen Amriswil an, wo er jedoch laut den Ermittlern nie gewohnt hat. ![Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/EdaEx7mbKe29b_TumnzYuR.jpg \"Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.\") Gestützt auf diese Angaben, stellte das Migrationsamt Thurgau dem angeblichen Artur Gitta eine B-Aufenthaltsbewilligung aus. «Mit ihrem Verhalten und ihren Tätigkeiten erweckte die Beschuldigte den Anschein, dass es sich bei Artur Gitta (Flor Bressers) um einen rechtschaffenen Bürger handelte», heisst es in der Anklageschrift. Auch soll Aida P. «Gitta» dabei unterstützt haben, dass er bei Behörden nie selber oder mit seinen echten Personalien auftreten musste. Damit habe sie ihm «wissentlich oder willentlich geholfen», seine wahre Identität zu verschleiern und ihn dem Zugriff der Strafverfolgungsbehörden zu entziehen. ## Der Finanzchef und der Concierge Als schwerster Vorwurf wiegt jedoch, dass die 36-jährige Treuhänderin Gelder aus dem Kokainhandel gewaschen haben soll, indem sie diese entgegennahm und in der Schweiz investierte. Der direkte Gewinn für die Treuhänderin betrug dabei laut Anklageschrift 51’000 Franken, wobei aus einem Bauprojekt am Bodensee weitere 100’000 Franken erwartet wurden. Ab September 2020 erhielten Aida P. und ihre 34-jährige Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. (Name geändert) über Geldkuriere nachweislich insgesamt 320’000 Franken Bargeld von drei Männern: «Gitta», dessen damals ebenso im Kanton Zürich lebenden Finanzchef Bastiaan K. und einem ergebenen [privaten Concierge](/concierge-ermoeglichte-luxusleben-wie-sich-der-kokainkoenig-in-zuerich-versteckte-847540903985). ## Wusste die Treuhänderin, wer Artur Gitta wirklich ist? 190’000 Franken davon seien in zwei Tranchen jeweils in einer Schuhschachtel in Aida P.s Treuhandbüro am Bodensee übergeben worden. Das Geld war vorgesehen, um die unverdächtige Firma der eingangs erwähnten Beizerin zu kaufen. Die Kauf- und Vertragsverhandlungen dafür führte Aida P. laut Staatsanwaltschaft im Namen von «Gitta». 190’000 Franken Bargeld gingen an die Beizerin. Vor Gericht sagt die Treuhänderin: «Wir haben seinen Ausweis überprüft, aber nicht sein Geld.» Auch für zwei Banken sei Artur Gitta «sauber» gewesen. Nach der Übernahme wurde die Firma in «Gitta Suisse AG» umbenannt und residierte an der derselben Adresse am Bodensee wie das Treuhandbüro. Dies sollte Flor Bressers den Anschein eines gewöhnlichen Unternehmers verleihen mit offiziellem Wohn- und Arbeitsort im ländlichen Thurgau. ![Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. ](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/9qlyQJe14XOAq3ua2_2vsd.jpg \"Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. \") Mit Geld vom Konto seiner unscheinbaren Firma kaufte die Treuhänderin im Februar 2021 zehn Kilo Silberbarren im Schätzwert von 6800 Franken und verwahrte sie im Bankschliessfach ihres Büros. ## Die verzweigten Geldflüsse der Treuhänderinnen Die verbleibenden etwa 130’000 Franken Bargeld zahlten Aida P. und ihre Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. in vier- bis fünfstelligen Beträgen zunächst auf ihre Privatkonten ein. Von dort überwiesen die beiden Frauen das Geld laut Anklageschrift unter Angabe falscher Gründe, etwa «Rückzahlung Kleinkredit», auf das Firmenkonto ihres Treuhandbüros. Von diesem und einem weiteren Firmenkonto der Gitta Suisse AG überwies Aida P. zwischen September 2020 und November 2021 elf «fingierte Gehaltszahlungen» an Artur Gitta über jeweils 4500 Franken – insgesamt rund 50’000 Franken. Doch laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat «Gitta» nie für das Treuhandbüro am Bodensee gearbeitet. «Man hätte es vermuten können, wer er in Wahrheit ist, aber ich habe es nicht vermutet. Ich bin zu wenig vorsichtig gewesen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. ## Falsche Angaben bei Behörden Im Juni und Juli 2021 soll die beschuldigte Treuhänderin bei den Steuer- und Einwohnerbehörden der Stadt Amriswil unwahre Angaben über den tatsächlichen Wohnort des Kokainkönigs gemacht haben. Zur selben Zeit überwies Aida P. 70’000 Franken auf ihr Privatkonto, um damit bei einem Luxusgeschäft im Zürcher Kreis 4 eine exklusive Stereoanlage für «Gitta» zu kaufen. Dieser gab mit seiner Lebensgefährtin im selben Laden weitere 64’000 Franken aus. Für Schmuck waren es 667’000 Franken und für Wein 400’000 Franken – über 2,5 Millionen Franken in etwa 20 Monaten. ## Finanzchef wird am Basler Flughafen verhaftet Im Oktober 2021 musste «Gitta» einen schweren Rückschlag verdauen: Sein engster Vertrauter, der erwähnte Finanzchef Bastiaan K., wurde am Flughafen Basel-Mulhouse verhaftet und später nach Belgien ausgeliefert. Dasselbe Schicksal ereilte den als Flor Bressers enttarnten «Gitta» vier Monate später. Beide mutmasslichen Schwerkriminellen warten seither mit 33 weiteren Beschuldigten auf ihren Prozess in Belgien, wie diese Redaktion aus Justizkreisen erfahren hat. Bei einer Verurteilung drohen beiden lange Gefängnisstrafen. ## «Die Alarmglocken müssen schrillen» Weit glimpflicher kommen die beiden Treuhänderinnen dank Geständnissen und eines Deals mit der Staatsanwaltschaft davon. Giulia S. erhielt einen rechtskräftigen Strafbefehl mit einer bedingten Geldstrafe von 180 Tagessätzen à 90 Franken und einer Geldbusse von 3900 Franken. Zudem muss sie 80’000 Franken als Ersatzforderung an den Staat zahlen. ![Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/6dudW4BXquo9FvO50rGpti.jpg \"Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)\") Am Ende erkennt Aida P. sämtliche Vorwürfe an. Die Richter verurteilten sie zu einer bedingten Freiheitsstrafe von zwölf Monaten sowie zu eine bedingten Geldstrafe von 90 Tagessätzen à 110 Franken – insgesamt 9900 Franken. Ausserdem muss sie 120’000 Franken mutmassliche Drogengelder an den Staat zahlen. «Wenn man soviel Bargeld erhält, müssen im Kopf die Alarmglocken schrillen. Das war bei Ihnen nicht der Fall», sagte der Richter zum Schluss. Das Urteil ist nicht rechtskräftig.

Aida P. allegedly helped Bressers conceal his true identity by providing a false identity (\"Artur Gitta\"), securing a Swiss residence permit under false pretenses, and issuing a sham employment contract to create the appearance of a legitimate citizen. She is accused of knowingly facilitating money laundering by receiving and investing drug proceeds in Switzerland, including handling at least CHF 320,000 in cash delivered by money couriers connected to Bressers and his associates. Part of these funds (CHF 190,000) were used to purchase a local company under Bressers’ control, with Aida P. conducting negotiations on his behalf. The treuhänderin reportedly profited directly by CHF 51,000, with further gains expected. The case highlights failures in KYC and suspicious transaction monitoring, as banks reportedly considered \"Artur Gitta\" a clean client despite the underlying criminal activity.

       " 'hyde_list': ['**Lukoil Under Scrutiny: Potential Money Laundering Risks and Regulatory Implications**\\n\\nRecent investigative reports have brought to light allegations of money laundering activities linked to Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil companies. From a regulatory compliance standpoint, these developments warrant a thorough examination of the company’s adherence to international anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks and sanctions regimes, particularly given the heightened geopolitical tensions and stringent enforcement environments.\\n\\nThe primary concern centers on whether Lukoil’s financial transactions have circumvented key provisions under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, which constitute the global standard for AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Specifically, FATF Recommendation 10 mandates robust customer due diligence (CDD) and ongoing monitoring to detect and prevent illicit financial flows. If Lukoil engaged in structuring payments or layering transactions to obscure the origin of funds, this would constitute a breach of these protocols.\\n\\nMoreover, given the current sanctions imposed by the United States under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the European Union’s restrictive measures targeting Russian entities, any facilitation of sanctioned transactions by Lukoil could result in significant penalties. OFAC’s enforcement actions have historically included hefty fines and restrictions on correspondent banking relationships for entities found complicit in evading sanctions. Compliance officers should note that secondary sanctions risks also arise if third-party financial institutions inadvertently process illicit payments linked to Lukoil.\\n\\nIn addition to AML and sanctions compliance, the European Union’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD), which criminalizes money laundering as a standalone offense and extends liability to legal persons, may provide a legal basis for prosecution within EU jurisdictions.\\n\\nFor compliance teams and legal counsel, this situation underscores the critical importance of enhanced transaction monitoring, rigorous vendor and counterparty screening, and real-time sanctions screening protocols. Failure to implement these controls not only jeopardizes regulatory standing but also exposes financial institutions to reputational damage and operational disruptions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil money laundering allegations highlight a complex intersection of AML and sanctions compliance risks. Vigilance and proactive regulatory adherence remain paramount to mitigating exposure in this evolving landscape.',\n",
       "  '**Unveiling the Veil: Forensic Financial Analysis Exposes Lukoil’s Money Laundering Scheme**\\n\\nBy [Journalist Name]\\n\\nIn an intricate web of cross-border transactions and shell entities, Lukoil, Russia’s oil giant, stands accused of orchestrating a sophisticated money laundering operation designed to obscure illicit proceeds and shield them from regulatory scrutiny. My forensic financial investigation, grounded in meticulous transaction pattern analysis and accounting record scrutiny, reveals alarming irregularities that pose significant reputational and regulatory risks to associated financial institutions.\\n\\nThe scheme’s architecture hinges on a multi-layered layering process, wherein Lukoil funneled revenues through a network of offshore subsidiaries registered in low-transparency jurisdictions. Transaction flow analysis exposes a recurrent pattern: large-volume transfers denominated in multiple currencies rapidly cycling through a series of accounts with minimal economic rationale. These “round-tripping” transactions artificially inflate trading volumes and generate misleading audit trails, complicating the detection of true cash origins.\\n\\nFurthermore, anomalous invoice patterns emerged—contracts with inflated values and vague service descriptions—suggesting the use of trade-based money laundering techniques. These invoices served as a façade to legitimize the flow of funds, masking proceeds from potentially corrupt procurement deals or kickbacks. The financial statements reflect disproportionate growth in intangible assets and intercompany receivables, inconsistent with operational performance metrics, signaling potential asset misclassification to conceal illicit gains.\\n\\nCritical to this forensic inquiry is the identification of “layering nodes,” accounts exhibiting high-frequency, low-value transactions designed to fragment money flows and evade threshold-based monitoring systems. These nodes correlate strongly with entities flagged in international sanctions lists, indicating possible circumvention of compliance controls.\\n\\nFor risk managers and auditors, this case underscores the imperative of integrating advanced forensic analytics into due diligence protocols. Reliance on traditional financial reporting obscures the complex laundering mechanisms employed by conglomerates like Lukoil. Enhanced scrutiny of transaction patterns, combined with cross-jurisdictional data sharing, is essential to preempt reputational damage and uphold the integrity of the global financial system.',\n",
       "  '**Lukoil and the Imperative of Strengthened Operational Controls Amid Money Laundering Allegations**\\n\\nRecent allegations implicating Lukoil in money laundering activities underscore critical vulnerabilities in corporate governance and internal control frameworks that demand urgent attention from operational risk professionals. As one of Russia’s largest oil companies, Lukoil’s exposure to complex financial transactions and cross-border dealings inherently increases its susceptibility to illicit financial flows, necessitating robust operational safeguards.\\n\\nFrom an operational risk assessment standpoint, the reported money laundering activities reveal potential lapses in Lukoil’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls and compliance monitoring systems. Effective AML frameworks require comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, transaction monitoring, and timely reporting mechanisms. The emergence of suspicious transactions linked to Lukoil suggests deficiencies in these core processes, possibly exacerbated by inadequate segregation of duties and insufficient oversight at governance levels.\\n\\nMoreover, the governance structures overseeing Lukoil’s financial operations warrant scrutiny. Operational risk teams must evaluate whether the board and senior management have established a risk-aware culture that prioritizes transparency and accountability. The presence of systemic risks—such as collusion among employees or external intermediaries—can significantly impair the integrity of financial reporting and expose the institution to regulatory sanctions and reputational damage.\\n\\nTo mitigate such risks, operational risk functions should advocate for enhanced internal audit cycles focusing on AML compliance, reinforced training programs for staff on fraud detection, and integration of advanced analytics to identify anomalous patterns. Additionally, strengthening whistleblower protections can empower employees to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil case serves as a cautionary tale emphasizing the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls and governance mechanisms. Operational risk professionals must leverage this incident to reassess and fortify their AML frameworks, ensuring resilience against financial crimes that threaten organizational stability and market integrity.',\n",
       "  '**Lukoil and the Shadow of Money Laundering: Assessing Reputational Risks in a High-Stakes Partnership**\\n\\nIn recent months, Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil producers, has found itself entangled in allegations of money laundering—an issue that reverberates far beyond legal boundaries into the realm of reputational risk. For financial institutions considering partnerships or transactional relationships with Lukoil, understanding the nuanced media landscape and public sentiment is critical to safeguarding brand integrity.\\n\\nMedia outlets across Europe and North America have reported extensively on investigations linking Lukoil executives to complex laundering schemes designed to obscure illicit proceeds. These reports often highlight the use of shell companies and offshore accounts, underscoring the sophisticated nature of the alleged operations. Importantly, the narrative is not confined to isolated accusations but is framed within a broader context of systemic corruption in the energy sector, amplifying concerns among stakeholders.\\n\\nPublic perception, as gauged through social media discourse and analyst commentary, reveals a growing skepticism toward institutions associated with Lukoil. Environmental activists and anti-corruption watchdogs have seized on these allegations to call for heightened scrutiny and divestment, placing additional pressure on banks and financial partners. The reputational fallout is palpable: associations with entities accused of money laundering risk eroding public trust and invite regulatory scrutiny that can disrupt business continuity.\\n\\nFor communications and public relations professionals, the imperative is clear. Engaging with Lukoil in any capacity demands rigorous due diligence and transparent communication strategies that address stakeholder concerns head-on. Failure to do so risks not only legal exposure but also the erosion of brand equity in an era where reputational capital is as valuable as financial assets.\\n\\nIn sum, the Lukoil money laundering allegations serve as a cautionary tale. They underscore the intricate interplay between criminal investigations, media framing, and public perception—an interplay that must be carefully navigated to protect institutional reputations in an increasingly vigilant global marketplace.',\n",
       "  '**Assessing Lukoil’s Exposure to Money Laundering Risks: A KYC/AML Compliance Perspective**\\n\\nRecent allegations linking Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil companies, to potential money laundering activities underscore critical vulnerabilities in corporate KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) frameworks within the energy sector. From a compliance standpoint, these developments warrant a rigorous examination of Lukoil’s customer identification procedures, beneficial ownership transparency, and transaction monitoring controls.\\n\\nAt the core of effective AML compliance is robust customer due diligence (CDD). For an entity of Lukoil’s scale, this entails comprehensive verification of counterparties, including end-users and intermediaries involved in oil trading and financing arrangements. Deficiencies in identifying ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) can create opacity, facilitating illicit actors to exploit complex ownership structures for layering illicit proceeds. Reports suggest that opaque offshore entities and shell companies may have been leveraged to obscure the origin and destination of funds, a classic red flag in money laundering typologies.\\n\\nMoreover, transaction monitoring systems must be calibrated to detect atypical patterns consistent with trade-based money laundering (TBML), such as over- or under-invoicing of oil shipments, circular trading, or rapid movement of funds through high-risk jurisdictions. The absence of dynamic risk-based controls and real-time analytics can delay the detection of suspicious activities, increasing regulatory and reputational risks.\\n\\nFrom a regulatory compliance perspective, Lukoil’s AML program should align with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, including enhanced due diligence (EDD) for politically exposed persons (PEPs) and entities operating in high-risk countries. Failure to implement such standards not only contravenes international norms but also exposes the company to sanctions and enforcement actions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil case exemplifies the imperative for energy companies to strengthen KYC/AML controls, ensuring transparency and mitigating the risk of facilitating money laundering. Compliance officers should prioritize continuous enhancement of beneficial ownership disclosures and deploy sophisticated transaction monitoring tools to safeguard against illicit financial flows.'],\n",

Scopul final era ca acesta să fie documentat și reținut inclusiv pentru implicarea sa în activitatea ilegală a grupării Șor. Declarațiile în acest sens au fost făcute de șeful Inspectoratului General al Poliției (IGP), Viorel Cernăuțeanu, în cadrul emisiunii „Obiectiv Comun” de la** [**TVR Moldova**](https://tvrmoldova.md/article/e24b47905344db85/cernauteanu-ion-perju-a-fost-urmarit-luni-de-zile-pentru-a-deconspira-schema-de-spalare-a-banilor.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawM3Lm9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHohdR4VRumF9Yt2bbhU1u_vKZjXd16CodPpevaJsiCBgl_P_gkqBMKvUQlAn_aem_8EY2HOpc-87_Ts_LZhkMpg)**.** > *„Persoana se află o perioadă îndelungată de timp în vizorul nostru, fiind sub măsuri speciale de investigație.

El a acuzat autoritățile de falsificarea scrutinului și a anunțat că formațiunea sa va contesta rezultatele, deși este vizat în zeci de dosare privind coruperea alegătorilor. „Ceea ce a avut loc ieri nu au fost alegeri, ci o numire. Evident că vom contesta toate rezultatele. Nu vom recunoaște rezultatele alegerilor, pentru că nu au fost alegeri, a fost o numire. Nu mai vorbesc despre faptul că o serie de partide pur și simplu nu au ajuns la alegeri, pentru că au fost eliminate”, a declarat Șor, în direct la televiziunea publică rusă. Liderul blocului „Pobeda” a susținut că dispune de „sute de dovezi” privind falsificarea alegerilor, însă nu a prezentat niciuna. Totodată, el a lansat acuzații false, afirmnd că „CEC încă se teme să publice datele pe secții de votare, pentru ca observatorii din opoziție să nu le poată compara cu cele din procesele-verbale semnate”. Condamnatul fugar a mai spus că partidele afiliate lui vor lupta pentru anularea rezultatelor și vor apela la instanțele naționale și internaționale. Totodată, Șor a anunțat posibile proteste în Republica Moldova, care ar putea avea loc în zilele următoare. Precizăm că limitarea activității partidelor afiliate lui Ilan Șor și excluderea din cursă a unor formațiuni finanțate ilegal de Moscova s-au bazat pe probe prezentate de Poliție, SIS, CNA și Procuratură, care au documentat acceptarea banilor din partea grupărilor criminale și spălarea de fonduri. Potrivit datelor oficiale prezentate după prelucrarea tuturor voturilor din țară și din diaspora, cinci formațiuni politice acced în viitorul Parlament al Republicii Moldova, după alegerile din 28 septembrie. Este vorba despre Partidul Acțiune și Solidaritate (PAS) – care conduce detașat cu 50,20% din voturi – Blocul „Patriotic” (24,17%), Blocul „Alternativa” (7,96%), Partidul Nostru (6,20%) și Partidul „Democrația Acasă” 5,62%).

E vorba de reținere pentru detenție în condamnarea pentru omor, dar și de presupusă implicare în schemele de finanțare ilegală operate de gruparea Șor. Cernăuțeanu susține că oamenii legii l-ar fi ținut în vizor pe Perju pentru încheierea investigațiilor în cazul finanțării Trust Media. ``` Această persoană este în vizorul Poliției de o perioadă mult mai îndelungată. Au fost realizate și măsuri speciale de investigație, sub filaj. În același timp, ne-am pus întrebarea cnd s-a inițiat această operațiune la care el asigura intermedierea proceselor de convertire, lichefiere, spălare de bani pentru gruparea criminală Șor dacă îl reținem la faza incipientă, și acest lucru cumva dădea peste cap tot procesul de documentare a spălării banilor, sau dacă continuăm să documentăm acest lucru în timp ca să ajungem la un punct final. ``` Autor: Viorel Cernăuțeanu, șeful IGP Șeful Poliției Naționale susține că decizia a fost să-l țină în vizor pe Ion Perju pnă la încheierea investigațiilor, urmărindu-se cursul tranzacțiilor. ``` Rămnea să alegem, cteva luni în urmă, dacă sistăm procedura de finanțare și spălare de bani și dacă mergem pe criteriu că l-am localizat și îl avem în documentare pentru omor. Sau dacă vrem să desfășurăm această operațiune, dar cu riscul de a pierde procedură spălare de bani. ``` Autor: Viorel Cernăuțeanu, șeful IGP Cernăuțeanu afirmă că în dosarul de finanțare ilegală a Trust Media ar fi implicate și alte persoane. Acesta a confirmat „desfășurarea perchezițiilor și ridicare de materiale, mijloace financiare și bunuri, att de la o companie de construcție, o companie petrolieră, trei domicilii și sediul unei companii media afiliate grupării Șor”, în seara zilei de 16 septembrie. **CONTEXT.** Amintim că oamenii legii [au descins cu percheziții](https://agora.md/2025/09/16/perchezitii-la-trust-media-gruparea-sor-vizata-in-investigatii-de-spalare-de-bani-si-propaganda-pro-rusa-video) la posturile de televiziune, parte a companiei Trust Media.

Ulterior, din banii obținuți ilegal și-a cumpărat telefoane de ultimă generație.** Potrivit unui comunicat emis de Procuratura Generală, tnărul ar fi acționat sub îndrumarea unui membru al unui grup infracțional organizat, cu care ar fi comunicat prin rețeaua „Telegram”. Gruparea, alcătuită din persoane încă neidentificate, ar fi fost formată în scopul comiterii mai multor escrocherii și funcționa după o schemă bine pusă la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol precis în înșelarea victimelor și obținerea ilegală a banilor. Astfel, pe 25 aprilie 2025, membrii grupului infracțional ar fi apelat o femeie din Chișinău, pretinznd că sunt reprezentanți ai unei bănci. Sub motivul că pe contul ei s-ar fi detectat tentative de tranzacții neautorizate, aceștia ar fi convins-o să le ofere parola de acces la cardul bancar. Ulterior, la instrucțiunile grupului, inculpatul s-ar fi deplasat la un bancomat din Bălți, unde a extras suma de 8.000 de lei din contul victimei. În aceeași zi, folosind datele bancare obținute ilegal, acesta a efectuat achiziții frauduloase într-un magazin de electronice, cumpărnd trei telefoane mobile de ultimă generație, în valoare totală de 79.296 de lei. Prin hotărrea emisă de Judecătoria Bălți, inculpatul a fost găsit vinovat și condamnat la 5 ani de închisoare, într-un penitenciar de tip semiînchis. Instanța a mai dispus și confiscarea bunurilor dobndite prin mijloace frauduloase.

Moldova” ``` Șeful Inspectoratului General al Poliției, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, a acordat un interviu în exclusivitate Agenției Informaționale de Stat „MOLDPRES”. În cadrul acestuia, conducerea Poliției Naționale a vorbit despre campania „Nu te juca cu votul, că vei pierde totul”, protestele regizate de gruparea criminală Șor, miza Federației Ruse în alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie curent, tentativele de destabilizare, schemele de corupere electorală și implicarea reprezentanților cultelor religioase în campania electorală. MOLDPRES: Domnule Viorel Cernăuțeanu, Poliția Națională a lansat campania „Nu te juca cu votul, că vei pierde totul”, cu trei săptămni înainte de alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie. De ce este nevoie de o asemenea acțiune a oamenilor legii și ce obiective urmăriți? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Această campanie va cuprinde mai multe activități de informare și comunicare, mesaje și spoturi video. Poliția își dorește ca toți cetățenii să fie informați despre o ilegalitate sau despre un act care s-ar încadra într-o faptă ilegală. Ne dorim ca oamenii să perceapă această informație ca o formă de prevenire și să nu comită acțiuni ilegale. Prioritatea noastră este să comunicăm cu cetățenii, dar nu să sancționăm. Din aceste considerente, am recurs la această campanie amplă, prin care ne dorim să ajungem la ochii și urechile ctor mai mulți cetățeni. Acolo unde nu se va înțelege prin prevenire și comunicare, imediat vom recurge la următoarea etapă - de sancționare și documentare, fie contravențională, fie penală. De asemenea, vreau să menționez că această campanie, inclusiv mesajul care este amplasat pe unele instituții sau pe mijloacele de transport ale poliției, a fost avizat pozitiv de Comisia Electorală Centrală (CEC). Deci, toate mesajele, toate spoturile, tot ce vizează această campanie nu apare în spațiu public pnă nu avem avizul CEC, pentru a fi și noi siguri că nu există loc de interpretare în cazul acestor acțiuni. În cadrul campaniei, mai multe mesaje audio vor fi incluse în anumite locații cu o concentrație masivă de cetățeni, vor fi împărțite pliante informative, inclusiv în localitățile rurale, cum ar fi la primărie, poștă sau în alte locații. Totodată, vor fi repartizate anumite bunuri care vor conține acest mesaj. Textul va putea fi găsit și pe unele facturi de plată. În acest mod, cetățeanul va fi atenționat despre riscul corupției electorale și consecințele existente în cazul în care își vinde votul. În același timp, am discutat și cu operatorii de telefonie mobilă ca să transmitem acest mesaj informativ și prin SMS-uri. Îndemnul va fi distribuit și pe rețelele de socializare, la radio-uri și TV. Avem deja și cteva spot-uri video realizate, care vor fi difuzate în cadrul acestei campanii. Sperăm ca aceste acțiuni să-și facă efectul și un număr ct mai mare de cetățeni să fie informați. MOLDPRES: Federația Rusă ar fi planificat să investească cel puțin 100 de milioane de dolari pentru a cumpăra voturi și a deturna rezultatele alegerilor parlamentare, a anunțat recent președinta Maia Sandu, după ultima ședință a Consiliului Suprem de Securitate. Alte voci spun că resursele planificate de Moscova pentru a deturna rezultatele alegerilor din Republica Moldova ar fi de cteva ori mai mari. Ce date are poliția? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Vreau să vă prezint o analiză comparativă, ca să înțelegeți unele elemente. Doar în luna septembrie, înainte de alegerile prezidențiale din anul 2024, am documentat 39 milioane de dolari care erau transmiși prin intermediul sistemului bancar din Federația Rusă pentru procurarea voturilor. Atunci, la acea etapă, pentru cumpărarea unui vot se transmitea estimativ în jur de 5 000 de ruble rusești. În scrutinul parlamentar din acest an, tendința pentru procurarea sau coruperea unui cetățean este de 15 000 de ruble rusești. Deci, vedem că suma s-a triplat. Vreau să menționez că, atunci cnd ne referim la suma de 100 de milioane, trebuie să înțelegem că e vorba doar de un segment îngust din toată această schemă largă care urmărește procurarea voturilor. Dacă ne axăm pe alte aspecte - există confecționarea pliantelor și ziarelor pentru care se cheltuie bani nu pentru corupere electorală, dar pentru dezinformare. Noi deținem miile de numere de telefoane care lucrează în call-centrele lor, unde este o altă formă de finanțare. Deci, în afară de cele 100 de milioane, vedem că se alocă și aici bani pentru salarii, care sunt mult mai mari, nicidecum nu vorbim de doar 15 000 de ruble. De asemenea, aceștia au mai multe departamente: de securitate, logistic, departamentul IT, unde finanțările și plățile de întreținere a întregii caracatițe sunt mult mai mari. Trebuie să cunoaștem că suma de 100 de milioane de dolari este doar a treia parte din suma investită de Federația Rusă și exponenții săi în procesul electoral din Republica Moldova. Coruperea alegătorului în ziua scrutinului este o chestie consumată. Aceasta rămne în concepția trecutului, pnă în anii 2022. Începnd cu 2022-2023, a fost schimbat mecanismul. Am văzut și în alegerile de anul trecut că nu s-a vorbit direct cu cetățenii că iată vă oferim această sumă de bani, votați în acest mod. O mare parte din plăți s-au făcut la sfrșitul lunii august, începutul lunii septembrie. De asemenea, unii cetățeni au fost asigurați că vor primi banii după alegeri, ca să nu existe premisa ca un candidat să fie exclus din cursa electorală. Trebuie să înțelegem un simplu aspect: această piramidă care funcționează în interesul Federației Ruse, nu lucrează pentru un partid – cum ar fi cele asociate lui Ilan Șor sau pentru alte formațiuni, aceasta va lucra exact în sarcina și la indicațiile care vor veni de la Moscova. Anume acest lucru l-am văzut și în alegerile prezidențiale din 2024, cnd s-a schimbat orientarea către anumite personaje, în interesul Federației Ruse, prin intermediul pionului Șor. Aceeași tendință se va menține și în alegerile parlamentare, vor ghida către persoana de interes, care poate fi în continuare coordonatorul proceselor de aici în interesul Rusiei. MOLDPRES: Cum reușesc aceste resurse financiare să intre în Republica Moldova, prin ce canale? Ce mecanisme de detectare și blocare are Poliția? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Aplicația PSB sau sistemul bancar al Federației Ruse PSB în continuare este valabil, doar că transferurile nu se mai realizează doar pe cardul virtual al cetățeanului. Acum mecanismul este puțin mai sofisticat. Toate aceste date nu mai vin pe telefonul mobil, dar se utilizează aplicația Taito, descărcată din Telegram, care este utilizată pentru a vedea viramentul financiar al plăților care îi vin persoanei. Acești bani parcurg cțiva pași - din rubla rusească în crypto, din crypto în dolar și din dolar ajung virați în lei deja către cetățean fie pe card, fie cash. Anume aceste aspecte au fost documentate în ultimele perioade, inclusiv perchezițiile din ultimele zile. Persoanele care au fost reținute sunt o parte din cetățenii care asigură acest proces de lichefiere și de transmitere a banilor către electorat. Cu părere de rău, nici Taito, nici Telegram nu au reacționat la solicitările noastre legate de acest proces. Avem mecanismele noastre și cetățenii trebuie să înțeleagă că cei din Federația Rusă și interpușii care organizează acest proces i-au pus într-o situație proastă pe cetățeni, întruct toate procesele sunt documentate. Dacă cineva crede că acea tranzacție făcută prin mediul virtual nu poate fi documentată se înșală amarnic, deoarece orice tranzacție lasă urme și poate fi stabilită. Putem afirma cu siguranță că miza celor care urmăresc coruperea și influențarea decizii electorale în Republica Moldova nu este mai mică dect cea care a fost în anul trecut la alegerile prezidențiale. De asemenea, s-au pus accente foarte mari și s-a intensificat într-un pas galopant aspectul legat de dezinformare. Deci, anul trecut aveam o avalanșă mare de corupere electorală, iar dezinformarea cumva era pe locul doi. Acum, intenția de corupere a rămas aceeași, iar dezinformarea a trecut pe primul loc. Vedem cum sunt răspndite pe larg formele de dezinformare: că se înrolează cetățeni pentru a pleca la război, că va fi război, că minorii din familiile sărace se transportă în străinătate pentru prelevarea organelor. Deci, vedem multă dezinformare și forme de inducere în eroare a cetățenilor, care iau amploare și ajung la turații foarte și foarte mari. Aceste informații sunt distribuite pe rețelele de socializare și sunt făcute inclusiv prin inteligența artificială. În topul platformelor pe care sunt distribuite aceste informații se află TikTok-ul, unde se regăsesc cele mai multe video-uri și canale cu forme de dezinformare, iar peste 80% din acestea sunt create prin inteligența artificială. TikTok-ul este urmat de Telegramul și Facebook. Cu cei de la Facebook încercăm să colaborăm prin sistemul de comunicare și schimbul de date cu meta ca să asigurăm respectarea anumitor reguli. Este un proces anevoios, dar nu este imposibil. Cu TikTok-ul, acum o săptămnă, a fost instituit un punct focal, care garantează un contact cu poliția. Avem garanția că vom avea deschiderea pentru a lucra ct mai rapid și ct mai eficient, deoarece pnă acum am avut un intermediar care asigura acest proces și cumva se tergiversau lucrurile, dar atunci cnd vorbim de dezinformare acest lucru trebuie să se întmple în perioade foarte scurte și nu în zile sau săptămni, căci aceste video-uri acumulează sute de mii de vizualizări într-un timp record. MOLDPRES: În ultimele zile, organele de forță au desfășurat zeci de percheziții într-o cauză penală inițiată pentru corupere electorală, finanțare ilegală a partidelor politice și spălare de bani. În urma descinderilor, mai multe persoane au fost reținute. Acestea ar fi acționat în beneficiul unei organizații criminale ghidate din afara țării, cu scopul coruperii alegătorilor. Ne puteți oferi detalii despre schemele utilizate de grupare și despre persoanele aflate în vizorul poliției pentru organizarea acestor acțiuni? Viorel Cernăuțeanu: Sunt persoane care asigură anumite scopuri și interese legate de finanțare și corupere electorală, ceea ce este important să nu admitem acum în Republica Moldova. Cetățenii sunt din diferite regiuni ale țării. Există foarte multe acțiuni aflate în desfășurare, de aceea mizăm și pe sprijinul cetățenilor care, dacă vor comunica poliției despre faptul că au fost atrași în această schemă ilegală, vor fi scutiți de răspundere. În cadrul operațiunilor recente au fost ridicate sume de bani pentru coruperea electorală – cumpărarea directă a voturilor. La unii subiecți am văzut transferuri de sute de mii de ruble, la alții am văzut chiar și un milion de ruble transferate, în funcție de rolul care îl are în contextul desfășurării procesului electoral și asigurării coruperii alegătorilor. Cu referire la aspectele de corupere, de finanțare și cele legate de intenții de organizare a dezordinilor pe teritoriului Republicii Moldova în procesul electoral, instituțiile statului au luat anumite măsuri chiar la începutul anului curent, mă refer la procese de documentare. Persoanele implicate au rămas în mare parte aceleași. Totuși, o parte din liderii raionali, care au fost implicați în acțiuni ilegale în cadrul alegerilor din toamna anului trecut, acum sunt subiecți ai', summary='Date: 2025-09-08 | Source: MOLDPRES | Legal Status: Alleged | The head of the Moldovan General Police Inspectorate, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, alleged that the Russian Federation invested at least $100 million in efforts to corrupt voters and influence the parliamentary elections in Moldova. He detailed that $39 million was documented in September 2024 alone as being transferred through the Russian banking system to buy votes, with the amount paid per vote tripling from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 Russian rubles since the 2024 presidential elections. The funds are part of a broader scheme involving disinformation campaigns, call centers, and logistical support, with the $100 million representing only about one-third of the total Russian investment in electoral interference.

[Ioana Andreescu](https://stirileprotv.ro/autor/ioana-andreescu/) Ministerul venezuelean al Securității Publice a declarat într-un comunicat pe Instagram că influencerul Gabriel Jesús Sarmiento a murit în orașul Maracay, potrivit [CNN.](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/americas/venezuelan-influencer-sarmiento-tiktok-shot-dead-intl-latam) Gabriel Sarmiento critica frecvent grupurile criminale și presupusa corupție din rndul forțelor de ordine prin conținutul său online, iar ministerul a adăugat că moartea sa a survenit la scurt timp după ce acesta raportase „amenințări venite din partea membrilor GEDOs (Grupuri Structurate de Crimă Organizată) și a unor polițiști presupus implicați”. Maracay este capitala regiunii Aragua, regiune de unde își trage numele faimoasa bandă Tren de Aragua, deși nu există o legătură cunoscută între moartea influencerului și această grupare criminală.

Într-o înregistrare a livestreamului lui Gabriel Sarmiento văzută de CNN, se aude o femeie țipnd din afara cadrului, în timp ce un bărbat o întreabă de ce strigă. „Ce s-a întmplat, ce s-a întmplat?” strigă bărbatul în înregistrare, urmat de o rafală puternică de focuri de armă. „M-au împușcat!” strigă apoi bărbatul. Videoclipul se încheie cu imaginea a doi bărbați înarmați, neidentificați. Cteva secunde mai trziu, livestreamul se oprește, iar videoclipul se termină. Moartea lui Gabriel Sarmiento survine la puțin peste o lună după ce un alt influencer latino-american a fost ucis în timp ce transmitea live.

Garda de Mediu Prahova și Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Prahova sunt acuzate de o indiferență șocantă față de sănătatea publică, tolernd ani de zile funcționarea unei rețele care se sustrage controlului statului. Marile companii din industriile extractive, petroliere și de rafinare scapă nepedepsite, iar agențiile de mediu par complet lipsite de putere sau voință în fața acestor abuzuri flagrante. **Conexiuni politice suspecte și un monopol periculos** Legătura dintre Sterileco și figuri influente din politică, inclusiv fostul ministru Radu Oprea, creează o atmosferă de impunitate. Suspiciunile de favoritism politic și implicarea în afaceri obscure sunt extrem de grave. Un raport al Consiliului Concurenței din 2021 confirmă poziția dominantă a Sterileco pe piață (peste 40% cotă de piață), obținută prin achiziționarea unor concurenți precum Mondeco, Pro Air Clean Ecological și Demeco, toate controlate, în trecut, de aceiași asociați ai Stericycle Romnia (actuala Sterileco). Această fuziune ascunde, probabil, o strategie de eliminare a concurenței și consolidarea unui monopol ilegal. **Mărturii șocante și dovezi ale ilegalității** Multiple sesizări, inclusiv cele ale lui Oprișan Marius Danut, descriu nereguli alarmante: diferențe enorme între cantitățile colectate și cele incinerate, deșeuri aruncate direct la groapă din cauza utilajelor defecte, lipsa cntăririi deșeurilor, nerespectarea proceselor de sterilizare și incinerare, precum și aruncarea medicamentelor expirate la gropile de gunoi. Aceste practici, semnalate încă din 2016, pun în pericol sănătatea publică și mediul înconjurător. **Sancțiuni derizorii și o anchetă necesară** Deși Garda Națională de Mediu a aplicat o amendă de 300.000 lei și a anunțat sesizarea organelor de cercetare penală, măsurile par insuficiente și întrziate. Întrebarea care se impune este dacă intervenția unor figuri politice, precum Radu Oprea, a influențat această lentoare în reacția autorităților. Dosare penale pentru fals, vnzare de ambalaje neconforme și adrese false sunt în curs de investigare la București. Ziarul Incisiv de Prahova va continua să dezvăluie implicarea managerilor de spitale și a polițiștilor complici în această rețea criminală. **Primul caz: Spitalul de Boli Infecțioase „Sf. Parascheva” din Iași** Spitalul Clinic de Boli Infecțioase „Sf. Parascheva” din Iași, condus de Florin Roșu, a semnat un contract suspect cu Sterileco. În ciuda aparențelor legale, deșeurile medicale nu sunt procesate corespunzător, ci aruncate în gropi de gunoi din jurul Bucureștiului, din cauza utilajelor defecte ale Sterileco. Contractul, în valoare de 9.681 lei/pachet de deșeuri, este o dovadă a faptului că Sterileco, prin achiziționarea concurenților, controlează licitațiile și impune prețuri exorbitante. Această situație reprezintă o amenințare directă la adresa sănătății publice, cu riscul răspndirii de boli infecțioase. Mărturii ale angajaților Sterileco confirmă aruncarea ilegală a deșeurilor medicale, inclusiv medicamente expirate, în gropi de gunoi, ignornd complet reglementările legale. **Concluzie: O luptă pentru sănătate publică și justiție** Scandalul Sterileco dezvăluie un sistem corupt și ineficient în gestionarea deșeurilor. Este nevoie de o anchetă temeinică, tragerea la răspundere a celor vinovați și o reformă urgentă a sistemului de gestionare a deșeurilor pentru a proteja sănătatea publică și mediul. Ziarul Incisiv de Prahova va continua să investigheze acest caz și să informeze publicul despre evoluțiile situației. Vom reveni.

Publicat acum 10 ore pe noiembrie 6, 2025 De [Incisiv](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/author/incisiv/ \"Articole de Incisiv\") Cnd impostura își dă întlnire cu sinecura, iar disprețul față de romnii din străinătate devine sport național, nu e de mirare că scandalul ajunge pnă în Palatul Parlamentului. Ceea ce ziarul nostru, **Incisiv de Prahova**, a dezvăluit în premieră la jumătatea lunii octombrie a anului trecut, a sărit acum gardul și a aterizat direct pe pupitrele deputaților, transformndu-se într-un rechizitoriu parlamentar fără perdea. Doamna Ramona Lovin, deputat AUR, nu s-a mai abținut și a tras un semnal de alarmă care ar trebui să zdruncine din temelii Ministerul Afacerilor Externe, instituție mult prea des confuză între diplomație și circ de provincie. **„Sirena din Strehaia” și curtea ei de lachei: De la „Feng Shui” la facturile umflate, pe banii noștri! [(aici)](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/10/12/sirena-din-strehaia-si-curtea-ei-de-lachei-cum-se-sifoneaza-banii-publici-cu-zambetul-pe-buze-in-cetatea-eterna/)** Vă mai amintiți de Gabriela Dancău, „Excelența Sa” ambasadoarea Romniei în Italia, poreclită de crcotași „Sirena din Strehaia”? Era cea care, conform investigațiilor **Incisiv de Prahova** (12 octombrie 2025), transforma întlnirile cu oamenii de afaceri în ședințe de partid pentru „yesmeni” și cosmetiza realitatea ca o veritabilă „Madam Ceaușescu”. Ei bine, „Feng Shui-ul diplomatic” al „Excelenței Sale” a ajuns acum în atenția Parlamentului. Deputata Ramona Lovin a reiterat acuzațiile grave legate de sifonarea banilor publici, dar și de traseul spectaculos al soțului-pădurar, detașat de la Romsilva și angajat, „coincidență fericită”, șef administrativ la Centrul Cultural de la Roma. Un „accident” care a costat, iar acum e pe agenda publică! Nu mai puțin scandalos este episodul în care, înaintea misiunii din Italia, „Excelența Sa” a concediat abuziv funcționari consulari „pe taxe de urgență”, lăsnd romni din diaspora în stradă. Statul romn, adică noi, contribuabilii, a fost nevoit să despăgubească victimele, plătind TVA-ul local pentru achizițiile misiunii. O afacere profitabilă pentru „Excelența Sa”, o pagubă pentru bugetul public. Iar întrebarea, reluată acum și în Parlament, rămne: de unde are ambasadoarea bani pentru a-și trimite odrasla la cele mai exclusiviste colegii din Elveția, dacă nu cumva din „șpăgile toscane” și alte aranjamente dubioase? Ilegalitățile legate de detașarea lui Barbacsu, transformat din pădurar în „expert” plimbat pe bani mulți, nu au făcut dect să completeze tabloul corupției și al pilelor, un tablou pe care doamna Lovin l-a expus fără menajamente în plen. **Bordeaux, feuda „consulului” uitat de Romnia: O comedie (neagră) cu romni invizibili [(aici)](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/10/16/bordeaux-feuda-unui-consul-uitat-de-romania-o-satira-amara-despre-diplomatia-de-fatada/)** De la Roma, ne mutăm în Bordeaux, unde Ministerul de Externe pare să fi uitat că are datoria de a reprezenta Romnia, nu doar interesele personale ale unor anonimi cu titluri pompoase. Așa cum **Incisiv de Prahova** relata pe 16 octombrie 2025, **funcția de consul onorific s-a transformat, în cazul lui Michel Beylot, într-un hobby costisitor și o sinecură personală. Un personaj care nu vorbește limba romnă, nu are legături cu cultura țării, dar organizează „festivități pentru uz intern” unde romnii activi sunt invizibili, în timp ce „romnii de complezență” aplaudă o mascaradă.** Acest circ diplomatic, care discreditează imaginea Romniei în ochii partenerilor francezi, a fost de asemenea punctat de deputata Ramona Lovin. Ea a subliniat cum astfel de situații demonstrează un „dispreț față de romnii din străinătate” și o lipsă totală de responsabilitate. Ct va mai tolera Romnia aceste „consulate” fantomă, conduse de personaje fără anvergură, al căror singur merit pare să fie menținerea unor privilegii într-un sistem anchilozat? **Interpelarea-șoc: „Ministerul de Externe – între impostură, sinecuri și dispreț față de romnii din străinătate”** Sub acest titlu, care spune totul, deputata Ramona Lovin a aruncat mănușa în ringul politic. Interpelarea sa nu este doar o simplă formalitate, ci o strigare disperată a romnilor din diaspora, care s-au săturat să fie reprezentați de „impostori”. Faptul că angajați în consulate sunt „rude cu ambasadorii” și că există „consuli care nu vorbesc limba romnă” este, pentru mulți, o palmă dată identității naționale și un semn clar că în Ministerul de Externe, meritocrația este un concept extraterestru. Este timpul ca Parlamentul să meargă dincolo de simple interpelări și să ceară socoteală. Este timpul ca „Sirenele” și „Consulii” de carton să fie demascați și trimiși acolo unde le este locul, nu în ambasade, ci, poate, în paginile unor viitoare volume de fabule absurde. Pentru că, în cele din urmă, factura pentru acest circ o plătim tot noi. ***Iar rsul amar al romnilor din străinătate începe să se transforme într-o furie pe care niciun „Feng Shui” diplomatic nu o va putea calma. Vom reveni.*** (Cristina T.).

Emil Pascu, liderul sindical, a dezvăluit date parțiale aferente anului 2024, venind în replică la „minciunile” propagate în spațiul public conform cărora personalul din sistemul de apărare și ordine publică nu ar contribui proporțional cu salariile lor, în comparație cu angajații din alte sectoare, care plătesc contribuții sociale precum CAS. **Cine contribuie cu adevărat? Cifrele vorbesc** Deși recunoaște că „încă nu am primit răspunsuri de la toate unitățile”, Sindicatul Diamantul a oferit o serie de cifre impresionante, ce contrazic narativul public. Conform datelor parțiale obținute de Sindicatul Diamantul, peste un miliard de lei (echivalentul a peste 205 milioane de euro) au fost vărsați deja la bugetul de stat în 2024, provenind de la diverse structuri din cadrul Ministerului Afacerilor Interne (MAI) și unitățile subordonate. Printre contribuțiile individuale semnificative se numără: * **Inspectoratul General pentru Situații de Urgenţă (IGSU) și unitățile subordonate:** 790.130.292 lei (aproximativ 158.832.902 €) * **Ministerul Afacerilor Interne (doar Aparatul Central):** 69.266.275 lei (aproximativ 13.924.088 €) * **Inspectoratul Judeţean de Poliție Prahova:** 45.602.380 lei (aproximativ 9.167.014 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Olt:** 39.528.343 lei (aproximativ 7.945.989 €) * **Inspectoratul General pentru Imigrări (aparat central și unități din subordine):** 34.402.484 lei (aproximativ 6.915.659 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Tulcea:** 19.041.958 lei (aproximativ 3.827.855 €) * **Inspectoratul de Poliție Județean Bistrița-Năsăud:** 18.519.684 lei (aproximativ 3.722.909 €) * **Casa de Pensii Sectorială a M.A.I.:** 3.017.403 lei (aproximativ 606.564 €) * **Şcoala de Agenți de Poliție “Septimiu Mureșan” Cluj-Napoca:** 2.426.410 lei (aproximativ 487.758 €) * **Centrul de Formare şi Perfecţionare a Poliţiştilor “Nicolae Golescu” Slatina:** 1.896.363 lei (aproximativ 381.216 €) Totalul parțial al acestor contribuții se ridică la suma impresionantă de **1.023.831.592 lei**, echivalentul a aproximativ **205.811.843 euro**. **Opacitatea MAI: Refuzul contabilului sef și acuzațiile de ipocrizie** Contrastnd cu deschiderea Inspectoratului General pentru Situații de Urgență (IGSU), care a furnizat fără probleme cifra totală pentru unitățile subordonate, Ministerul Afacerilor Interne, prin Direcția Generală Financiară, a refuzat să ofere suma integrală a contribuțiilor individuale. Emil Pascu de la Sindicatul Diamantul a acuzat direct pe Grecu, contabilul șef al direcției, pentru acest refuz, catalogndu-l drept un obstacol deliberat. „Am cerut MAI să ne dea direct întreaga sumă vărsată cu titlu de CIBS, în anul 2024, de către toate unitățile ministerului. Am fi putut să vă punem la dispoziție, toată suma care s-ar fi dovedit uriașă! Însă bineînțeles că Grecu, contabilul șef al Direcției Generale Financiare, a refuzat!” a declarat Emil Pascu, citat de Sindicatul Diamantul. Liderul sindical a subliniat și ipocrizia situației, arătnd că același oficial „profită la maxim de toate drepturile polițiștilor (este «chestor», are salariu de «excelență», va avea drept la pensie militară, etc), deși este doar un contabil asimilat polițiștilor, în timp ce va pune bețe în roate ori de cte ori are prilejul!”, conform acuzațiilor făcute de Emil Pascu de la Sindicatul Diamantul. **Transparența, un drept: Apel la schimbare** Dezvăluirile Sindicatului Diamantul aduc în prim-plan nu doar sumele impresionante contribuite de personalul MAI, ci și necesitatea', summary='Date: 2024-09 | Source: IncisivdePrahova.ro | Legal Status: Ongoing/Alleged | Article alleges a corrupt criminal network operating under the guise of medical waste recycling by SC Sterileco SRL, involving money laundering suspicions and links to organized crime.

Dosarul de insolvență 3418/105/2023, depus la Tribunalul Prahova pe 9 august 2023, dezvăluie o rețea diverisificata spre a înșela și a prejudicia intenționat creditori și victime. În spatele acestei escrocherii stau personaje cu diverese motivații, toate consolidnd o schemă de fraudă bine pusă la punct. **Unele personaje cheie și modul lor de operare** Vlad Nichita, cunoscut ca „Il Capo”, a fost figura centrală în elaborarea acestei operațiuni. În cadrul biroului său de avocatură, alături de colaboratoarea sa, **av. Marinescu Denisa-Roxana**, au fost întocmite documente false și scheme de înșelăciune. În perioada în care Vlad Nichita se afla în stare de reținere preventivă la Cmpina, **av. Marinescu Denisa-Roxana** a încercat să-i „mngie” pe victimele prejudiciate, contactndu-le telefonic și chiar întlnindu-se personal cu unele dintre ele, încercnd să le convingă să retragă plngerile penale împotriva lui Vlad Nichita, invocnd lipsa implicării acestuia în vnzarea unor apartamente multiple de către PFA Lupu Marioara-Domnica, reprezentată de mama dezvoltatorului „din umbră”, Mihai Lupu. **Tabele de creditori – o păcăleală ordonată** ***Un aspect extrem de interesant îl reprezintă modul în care „Il Capo” întocmește tabelul creditorilor „doamnei Marioara”. În listă nu se află niciun pagubit căruia să nu-i fi fost restituit apartamentul sau apartamentele, însă pe lista acestor credite apar două firme controlate direct de “Il Capo”. Este vorba despre SC Fasty Tasty SRL, unde fiind administrator soția sa, Elena Nichita, și despre SC Lomina Invest SRL, avnd sediul în aceeași clădire, situată pe Strada Poligonului nr. 1. Canonizat drept controversat și urmărit att internațional, Lorenz Michael Nasturica, cunoscut ca „Nash”, este prezentat ca fiind proprietarul real al acestei firme, actnd sub influența și cu complicitatea directă a „Il Capo”.*** **O rețea de firme și manipulări financiare** Dorim să evidențiem cteva elemente: SC Lomina Invest SRL, cu cod fiscal Ro 46370443, are sediul în aceeași clădire ca și Fasty Tasty SRL, iar administratorul acesteia, Lorenz Michael Nasturica, s-a remarcat printr-un trecut plin de evaziune și furturi de autoturisme de lux în Germania, ulterior vndute în Romnia. Acest personaj, cunoscut pentru atitudinea sa de escroc din copilărie, a încercat să-și inducă în eroare partenerii și victimele, pretinznd a fi un investitor de succes în imobiliare, bursa sau criptomonede. Stilul său de viață opulent a fost menit să impresioneze și să cștige încrederea celor din anturaj. **Legături de o ambianță de mafie și conspirație** [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/06/reteaua-de-coruptie-din-ploiesti-se-prabuseste-epicentrul-controversei-e-mai-aproape-de-destramare-iar-scanteile-ultimei-riposte-pot-aprinde-un-altceva/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/05/confirmarea-oficiala-a-anchetelor-dezvaluirile-incisiv-de-prahova-dezvaluie-o-retea-de-coruptie-monumentala-in-ploiesti-cu-implicarea-politiei-justitiei-si-a-unor-personaje-cheie-precum-pseudo-ju/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/24/justitia-sub-atac-inculpatul-pseudo-jurnalist-spagar-si-santajist-stavri-catalin-in-centrul-unei-controverse-legate-de-abuzurile-procurorilor/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/14/vlad-nichita-intre-coruptie-si-evaziune-o-noua-faza-a-scandalului-white-tower/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/07/vlad-nichita-scapa-nicolae-alina-georgeta-ramane-sub-control-judiciar-semne-de-intrebare-in-justitie-ii/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/04/vlad-nichita-scaparea-de-sub-controlul-justitiei-o-poveste-de-coruptie-si-escrocherie/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/04/03/vlah-nichita-tupeul-unui-infractor-in-fata-justitiei/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/02/21/instanta-refuza-sa-cada-in-plasa-lui-vlad-nichita-contestatia-la-controlul-judiciar-a-fost-respinsa/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/01/09/retelele-de-coruptie-si-escrocheriile-imobiliare-vlad-nichita-si-conexiunile-sale/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/07/avocatul-vlad-nichita-pariaza-pe-ridicarea-sechestrului-asigurator-in-scandalul-white-tower-cu-bani-si-influenta-poti-face-orisice-in-republica-ploiesti/) [(aici),](https://www.incisivdeprahova.ro/2025/05/20/ploiestiul-orasul-sfidarii-si-al-coruptiei-de-la-stalpi-montati-la-masini-pe-trotuar-o-noua-faza-a-scandalului-white-tower/) etc. Relatiile dintre Mihai Lupu, Lorenz Nasturica și alți apropiați sunt întipărite de o legătură strnsă de „frățietate”, implicnd acte de corupție, escrocherii și manipulare. Conexiunea cu Vlad Nichita a fost facilitată de Mihai Lupu, care a fost prins în schema de fraudare a creditorilor, costndu-i milioane de lei, astfel înct acest grup să induce în eroare și să destabilizeze complet activitatea societăților implicate. **Fuga în Dubai și planuri de evadare** ## **Ce e și mai grav?** **Toți acești mafioți au creat un cerc vicios:** activează în ilegalitate, manipulează actele, fuzionează firmele și ascund milioanele furate în conturi off-shore, în timp ce sistemul judiciar preferă să închidă ochii. Ei au transformat justiția într-un simplu teatru de păpuși, unde hotărrile sunt dictate de interese obscure și de protecție mafioților în fața legii. **Furtul, falsificarile și delapidarea sunt doar începutul.** În spatele acestor scheme, se află o rețea bine închegată, plină de impostori, învățată să lucreze ca un mecanism perfect pentru a jefui statul și cetățenii deopotrivă. ## **Victimele? S-au transformat în numere, în statistici!** Dar adevărata tragedie e că acești criminali au distrus viețile multor oameni nevinovați. Păgubiți de apartamente, de bani, de speranțe? Nu, ei sunt acum niște simple cifre în bilanțul unor escroci care învrt banii, în timp ce sistemul se face că plouă. **Dacă justiția ar fi funcționat cu adevărat, acești infractori nu ar fi avut libertate cțiva ani în urmă.** Dar, în loc de a-i trimite după gratii, sistemul regionalizat i-a protejat și i-a ajutat să fugă, să ascundă banii și să controleze zona de la mare distanță. **În același timp, a orchestrat jocuri de înșelăciune de proporții, viznd ticăloși și oameni de afaceri, pe care i-a manipulat cu zecile de milioane de lei. În perioada 2021-2024, în Romnia, Lorenz Nasturica a fost protagonistul uneia dintre cele mai mari scheme financiare, o rețea intenționat creată pentru a juva și a păcăli pe oricine i se ivea în cale.** *Stilul său de viață—opulent, ostentativ, de lux—nu era altceva dect o mască menită să atragă victimele. Cu ceasuri Rolex, mașini de lux, haine de firmă, a dat iluzia unui „succes nemărginit”, dar adevărul e că totul a fost o păcăleală ordonată și criminală*. ### **Relații periculoase și colaborări la limita legii: Lupu, Lorenz și Vlad** Lorenz Nasturica nu a fost singur în această poveste de coșmar. În cercurile influenților, se leagă prietenii și alianțe periculoase. Împreună cu Mihai Lupu și Vlad Nichita, a format o triadă criminală de proporții, în care înșelătoria, delapidarea și manipularea au fost la ordinea zilei. *Lupu, pentru a-și masca adevărata origine a banilor, și-a construit o imagine de „afacerist de succes”, dar în realitate totul s-a bazat pe fraude, evaziune și scheme de escrocherii. Iar Lorenz, subtil și viclean, a fost piesa de rezistență—fugit în Dubai cu milionare, lăsnd în urmă un dezastru de păgubiți!* ### **„Fraierii” plătesc, iar sistemul se face că nu vede** De ce nu se face nimic? Pentru că justiția în Romnia nu prea are curajul sau voința să pună mna frecvent pe toți acești iresponsabili. Numele lor apar peste tot: în acte false, în declarații mincinoase, în balbe contabile trucate. Totul pentru a-i menține pe ei în libertate și a împiedica victimele să-și recupereze banii și drepturile. *Creditele sunt armele lor: în loc să recupereze, se implică în toate schemele de delapidare, umflnd bilanțuri și falsificnd bilanțurile contabile, iar sistemul le acoperă, de teamă sau de interese obscure.* **Lorenz Nasturica, fugind în Emirate, continuă să orchestreze scheme și dincolo de granițe**, doar pentru a-și proteja averea furată. Iar victimele, în marea lor majoritate, rămn cu speranța că, într-o zi, adevărul va ieși la lumină și acești criminali vor plăti pentru faptele lor. ## **Ce trebuie să se întmple ACUM?** *Rețeaua criminală trebuie desființată urgent! Sistemul piramidal de înșelăciune trebuie să fie demascat, trăgnd la răspundere pe toți cei implicați, de la mafioți de buzunar, la funcționari corupți și judecători complici.* *Victimele nu mai pot aștepta! Se cere o anchetă serioasă, respunsuri concrete și confiscarea activelor furate.* ### **Dreptatea trebuie să triumfe!** *Acest sistem corupt, în care mafie, politicieni și avocați în comun fură milioane și distrug vieți, trebuie să fie demolat din temelii. Nu mai e loc de scuze: criminalii trebuie să răspundă!* **Aceasta e realitatea cruntă: o mafie financiar-penală de proporții, o organizație de șarlatani, escroci și trădători ai sistemului! Ei trebuie aduși din nou în fața justiției, unde le e locul!** ## **Și de ce se întmplă toate acestea?** Pentru că, din păcate, **justiția este o păpușă**, iar cei care trebuie să o apere au devenit beneficiari ai acestei mafii. Sistemul a fost coruptizat în anii trecuti, iar adevărul este ascuns sub cantități enorme de dosare trucate, acte false și declarații mincinoase. **Victimele acestui jaf brutal nu vor răbdare!** Ei trebuie să vadă răspunsul sistemului în cel mai scurt timp, pentru ca adevărul să răsară și pentru ca acestor hoți să le fie luată tot ce au furat — fără milă, fără compromisuri. ## **PUNCT: Romnia trebuie să se trezească!** Pentru ca acești criminali să plătească, trebuie să-i scoatem în fața legii și să facem adevărata luptă cu mafia imobiliară. **Soborul furăciunii trebuie demascat, pricinuit răspunderea și confiscate toate averile furate.** **Dreptatea nu a fost făcută încă, dar vom fi la îndemna justiției dacă, cu toții, vom fi mai vigilenți, mai uniți și mai hotărți să nu îi lăsăm să ne fure viitorul!** ***Aceasta e realitatea: o țară în urgentă criză morală, în care mafia a devenit sistemul, iar sistemul, mafie! Vom reveni.** (Cristina T.).* ***Precizări:*** Legea 190 din 2018, la articolul 7, menţionează că activitatea jurnalistică este exonerată de la unele prevederi ale Regulamentului GDPR, dacă se păstrează un echilibru între libertatea de exprimare şi protecţia datelor cu caracter personal.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: 2023-03-08 | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290) | Legal Status: Ongoing sanctions enforcement | Lukoil is listed among major Russian oil companies sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under OFAC authorities as part of measures related to the conflict in Ukraine.

This information is archived and not reflective of current practice. ## Find Us On Twitter [@HSIHouston](https://www.twitter.com/HSIHouston) September 1, 2022Houston, TX, United StatesCounter Proliferation Investigation Unit, National Security # US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners HOUSTON - The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a warrant Aug. 31 for the U.S. to seize a $45 million aircraft owned by a Russian multinational oil and gas corporation following an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston, FBI Houston, and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security into alleged violations of sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Specifically, Eduard Benderskiy, a former FSB officer and father-in-law of Evil Corp leader Maksim Yakubets, was sanctioned for materially assisting Evil Corp and acting on behalf of the Russian government. Benderskiy’s private security firm provided security services for Lukoil facilities in Iraq around 2017. OFAC designated Benderskiy and his companies Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to Executive Orders 14024 and 13694 for supporting Evil Corp activities. While no direct allegations or investigations of Lukoil itself for financial crimes, AML deficiencies, or sanctions violations are stated, the involvement of a security firm linked to Lukoil’s operations with a sanctioned individual raises potential reputational and compliance risks. No charges, fines, or enforcement actions against Lukoil were reported. No information on Lukoil’s AML program or compliance measures provided.

Pleads Guilty to International Bribery Scheme ================================================================================= Thursday, August 22, 2024 **For Immediate Release** Office of Public Affairs A former energy trader pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to bribe Mexican government officials to secure contracts for his then-employer, Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S.affiliate of the largest independent energy trading firm in the world. According to court documents, Javier Aguilar, 50, of Houston, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PEMEX Procurement International, Inc. (PPI), a wholly owned affiliate of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), in exchange for assistance in winning business for Vitol. “Javier Aguilar has now admitted that he bribed foreign officials to win business when he worked as an oil and gas trader at Vitol Inc., using shell companies, fake contracts, sham invoices, and alias email accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Aguilar’s guilty plea yesterday follows his conviction at trial on related charges earlier this year. His illegal conduct netted Vitol hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, and now he will pay the price.” “With yesterday\\'s guilty plea, the defendant admits his role in the widespread corruption of the international commodities market and to casting aside laws and rules that apply to all to unfairly line the pockets of the few,” said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. “The actions of the defendant and his co-conspirators, and of those who act similarly, destroy people’s faith in their governments, disadvantage those who play by the rules, undermine confidence in American businesses worldwide, and will not be tolerated by this Office or our law enforcement partners.” “The Southern District of Texas is ground zero in the fight against foreign bribery and corruption in Latin America,” said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. “My office’s prosecutors — experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — will continue to bring to justice those who damage the integrity of Texas’s vital energy sector with illegal advantages fueled by greed. This guilty plea begins the process of repairing the damage caused by Aguilar as well as putting on notice those who might seek to emulate him and his cohorts.” “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been the law of the land, and enforceable worldwide, for decades. Yet unscrupulous businessmen still try to bribe their way to profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. “My message to them is that the charges and penalties you will face are not worth the gain. I want to commend the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Office of International Affairs; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas for their diligence pursuing this case, but especially the agents and analysts who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of FCPA violators.” Between 2017 and 2020, Aguilar, who was a trader in Vitol’s Houston office, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PPI to obtain numerous contracts for Vitol to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of ethane to PEMEX. To conceal the scheme, Aguilar and his co-conspirators used a series of fake contracts, sham invoices and shell entities incorporated in Curaçao and Mexico. The defendant and his co-conspirators also used alias email accounts to communicate about the scheme and code words, including “shoes,” “medicine,” “invitations,” and “coffee,” to describe the bribes. Aguilar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to a violation of the Travel Act. The FCPA conspiracy charge, which was brought by a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas, related to conduct that was initially charged in the Eastern District of New York. As part of his guilty plea, Aguilar consented to transfer the Texas case to New York, to consolidate the cases, and to forfeit $7,129,938. The plea follows Aguilar’s related [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-oil-and-gas-trader-convicted-role-foreign-bribery-and-money-laundering-scheme) at trial in February 2024 for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, violating the FCPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with schemes to bribe Ecuadorian and Mexican officials. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment on the money laundering offense and five years’ imprisonment on each of the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. In December 2020, Vitol [admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/vitol-inc-agrees-pay-over-135-million-resolve-foreign-bribery-case) to bribing officials in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S.Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York. As a part of the resolution, Vitol agreed to pay a combined $135 million in penalties as part of a coordinated resolution with the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and authorities in Brazil. Seven of the defendant’s co-conspirators have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing. These individuals have agreed to forfeit more than $63 million in connection with this and related schemes. FBI Miami’s International Corruption Squad investigated the case. Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan P. Lax, Matthew R. Galeotti, and Nick M. Axelrod for the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sherin Daniel and Deputy Chief Suzanne Elmilady for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The MLARS Special Financial Investigations Unit and Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance. The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at[www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa). The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to [kleptocracy@usdoj.gov](mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov)or[https://tips.fbi.gov/](https://tips.fbi.gov/).

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Hafeez](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/sahar-hafeez.html) [Samantha Franks](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/) Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-partnering-cross-agency-trade-fraud-task-force) the launch of a “cross-agency” Trade Fraud Task Force “to bring robust enforcement against importers and other parties who seek to defraud the United States.” According to DOJ, the Task Force will “augment the existing coordination mechanisms” within DOJ and leverage expertise from DOJ’s Civil and Criminal Divisions and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against any parties who seek to evade tariffs and other duties, as well as smugglers who seek to import prohibited goods into the American economy.” The Task Force announcement occurs against the backdrop of [intensified tariff activity](https://www.globaltradeandsanctionslaw.com/snapshot-of-current-tariff-actions-and-negotiations/), including reciprocal tariffs on nearly every trading partner, and [investigations on imports of critical materials](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/section-232-pharma-semiconductors-crit-minerals-trucks.html) from semiconductors to metals and minerals and pharmaceuticals under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. While statutes such as the False Claims Act (FCA) have occasionally predicated trade-related actions in the past, the Task Force represents a concerted effort by the U.S. government to bring greater resources, statutory authorities and prosecutorial power to bear on alleged customs violations. The Task Force is expected to promote coordination between DOJ and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to target evasion schemes, including false origin declarations, misclassification, fraudulent under-valuations and other alleged violations that undermine tariff policy and deprive the Government of tariff revenue. As discussed further below, this will likely include not only traditional CBP civil penalty enforcement but also civil *and* criminal actions under the FCA and statutes such as wire fraud, importing through false statements, and conspiracy. For importers, this dual pressure—policy expansion coupled with enforcement escalation—creates a complex compliance environment. While the announcement provides important information about how the Task Force will operate, importers and related businesses should stay attuned to the broader trade enforcement context and the open questions that remain in order to assess and mitigate their own risk. At the end of this piece we offer discrete recommendations, including audit and supply chain compliance that incorporates increased risk of DOJ involvement and FCA claims; internal and external reporting mechanisms for potential violations, from both companies and their competitors; and monitoring fast-moving legislative, judicial and regulatory developments that can impact import compliance. **How the Task Force Will Operate** On the personnel front, the Task Force will consist of litigators from the Criminal and Civil Divisions at DOJ. From the Criminal Division, the Task Force will include prosecutors from the Fraud Section’s newly established [Market, Government, and Consumer Fraud Unit](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/mgc-unit). Within the Civil Division, the announcement indicates the Task Force will be supported by members of the Commercial Litigation Branch’s Civil Fraud Section (which conducts False Claims Act enforcement) and National Courts Section (which has responsibility for civil customs fraud actions). According to the announcement, attorneys on the Task Force “will work closely with” investigators from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which are both part of DHS. As for strategy, DOJ’s announcement anchors the Task Force in the “America First Trade Policy” Presidential Memorandum (Jan. 20, 2025) and Executive Order 14243, “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos” (Mar. 20, 2025). According to DOJ, the Task Force will advance these policies by pursuing: (a) customs laws violations through duty and penalty collection actions under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Tariff Act”); (b) civil actions under the False Claims Act; and (c) parallel criminal prosecutions, penalties and seizures under Title 18’s trade fraud and conspiracy provisions. CBP enforces the civil penalty provisions of section 592 the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1592. Under the customs law, importers are held to a standard of reasonable care, which requires that importers exercise diligence to make accurate declarations regarding the classification, valuation, country of origin and applicable duty rates for imported merchandise. Section 1592(a) provides that “no person, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, may enter, introduce, or attempt to enter any merchandise” into U.S. commerce by means of a material misrepresentation or omission, or aid and abet such a violation. Where CBP has reasonable cause to believe an importer has violated section 1592, it may issue a written penalty notice seeking liquidated damages. Liquidated damages can range from a civil penalty of up to twice the duties owed (for negligence), to the full domestic value of the merchandise (for fraud)—though, after receiving a penalty notice, importers have the opportunity to seek mitigation of monetary penalties under the customs regulations, 19 C.F.R. Part 171. In addition to seeking civil monetary penalties under the Tariff Act, the Task Force announcement also reaffirms that DOJ will rely on other enforcement tools like the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729. The FCA has been called the government’s “[most powerful tool](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/March/159dag.htm)” for combatting fraud against the United States. Although the DOJ has not often used the FCA to bring trade fraud enforcement actions, the Ninth Circuit has [recently held](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/06/23/22-55063.pdf) that false claims can include not only fraudulent requests for payment but also evasion of obligations to pay customs duties otherwise owed to the government. And, in addition to per-violation civil penalties, the FCA authorizes courts to impose treble damages, which means that knowing violators could end up paying three times the amount of duties owed. Finally, a trade fraud investigation may implicate a number of criminal offenses in Title 18 of the United States Code, including sections 287 (criminal false claims), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 541 (false classification of goods), 542 (importing through false statements), 545 (smuggling), 1001 (false statements to government officials), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1349 (attempt and conspiracy to commit fraud), 1956 (money laundering), and 1957 (transactions in laundered funds). With the exception of sections 287 and 371, all of these offenses could give rise to criminal or civil forfeiture. That means, even absent a criminal conviction, DOJ could file a civil complaint, with a lower burden of proof, that seeks to forfeit the proceeds of trade fraud, a forfeiture money judgment in the same amount, or—in the case of money laundering—any property involved in a transaction with laundered funds. **The Broader Context** Prosecuting trade fraud is not new to DOJ. As the announcement recognizes, the Civil Division has resolved a number of trade prosecutions in 2025. Nor is the idea of a Trade Fraud Task Force new to the Department. As recently as March 2024, DOJ [praised](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ford-motor-company-agrees-pay-365m-settle-customs-civil-penalty-claims-relating) the work of a “Trade Fraud Task Force” in supporting a $365 million settlement with Ford Motor Company to resolve allegations that it violated the Tariff Act of 1930 by misclassifying and undervaluing hundreds of thousands of cargo vans imported from Turkey. Nonetheless, the 2025 version of the Task Force merits serious attention. First, DOJ has formally added the Criminal Division and HSI to the Task Force. The involvement of prosecutors and criminal investigators is likely to increase the number of trade fraud investigations, if not enforcement actions. Second, trade fraud prosecutions are being prioritized in a way they were not previously. That sends a message to agents and prosecutors that trade fraud cases are more likely to get leadership and press attention, which could incentivize working on Task Force matters instead of other investigations. Third, the Task Force announcement expressly encourages relators to alert the government to credible allegations of trade fraud by utilizing the FCA’s *qui* *tam* provisions to file sealed complaints on behalf of the United States. While *qui tam* complaints have long been an avenue for reporting fraud, the DOJ’s express receptiveness to reviewing and potentially acting on trade fraud complaints is new and likely to yield more such reports from an increasingly active relator-side bar. The addition of the Criminal Division to the Task Force is also significant. Trade penalties in the customs arena, including under the Tariff Act, have historically involved civil monetary penalties. Recent policy changes, however, increase the likelihood that trade fraud allegations and investigations develop into criminal prosecutions. In May 2025, the Division [expanded](http://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/140004) the scope of offenses that are eligible for its Corporate Whistleblower Awards Pilot Program to include corporate violations relating to trade, tariff and customs fraud. On September 16, 2025, the Criminal Division’s Acting Assistant Attorney General, Matthew R. Galeotti, [disclosed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-association) that, in the past four months, the Division received 313 whistleblower tips and that 120 of them—including tips relating to trade fraud—warranted further investigation. Also in May, the Division announced that it had [revised](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400031) its Corporate Enforcement Policy (CEP) to further encourage companies to voluntarily self-disclose misconduct—including misconduct relating to trade fraud. Under the revised CEP, absent aggravating circumstances, a company that voluntarily self-discloses, fully cooperates and remediates, and pays all forfeiture and restitution is *entitled* to a declination rather than a *presumption* of a declination. This is significant because the Tariff Act itself provides a mechanism for “prior disclosure,” which allows importers to disclose potential past violations to avoid more exacting monetary penalties. Accordingly, importers considering a prior disclosure to CBP should now also consult with counsel about making a voluntary self-disclosure under the Criminal Division’s CEP. **Unresolved Questions** Notwithstanding the information provided by DOJ about the new Task Force, a number of questions remain. The announcement did not include certain operational details, such as where within DOJ the Task Force will reside, who will lead its day-to-day work, or whether the Task Force will report on its activities beyond press releases describing individual cases. The announcement also did not indicate whether the Task Force will benefit from the allocation of any dedicated resources, whether agents or attorneys. A/AAG Galeotti did, however, recently [announce](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-global) that the Criminal Division would be “leading” DOJ’s effort to investigate and prosecute trade fraud, with a “particular focus” on cases involving (1) “long-running efforts to evade hundreds of millions in tariffs, including tariffs on Chinese products,” and (2) trade fraud schemes involving corporate executives. Some of the open questions may be answered through pending legislation. For example, legislators in the House’s Select Committee on the Chinese Community Party have reintroduced the bipartisan [Protecting American Industry and Labor from International Trade Crimes Act](https://mcusercontent.com/ffedde7e54b71a41a9505fff1/files/893afae6-3edc-b4f7-15a7-50a9afa42c35/HINSON_010_xml.pdf). Among other things, the Act would require the Criminal Division to establish a task force to prosecute trade crimes, and appropriate $20 million for the Division to hire and train prosecutors and investigators and conduct enforcement actions. Depending on the mix of attorneys, investigators and staff, this could result in the addition of as many as 50 to 60 personnel to the Task Force, and the more dedicated resources that are assigned to the Task Force, the more enforcement activity that can be expected. Congress may influence trade fraud prosecutions in other ways. For example, the Chairman of China Select Committee recently sent a [letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/) asking the agency to investigate an importer over the evasion of steep tariffs on Chinese goods—highlighting that Congress has also turned its attention to issues such as misclassification or transshipment of merchandise. Other questions may be addressed by the Supreme Court. On November 5, the Court will hear the U.S. government’s appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision in *V.O.S. Selections v. Trump*, which held that the President lacked the authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose reciprocal tariffs and the so-called “fentanyl” tariffs. Even if the Supreme Court allows the lower court ruling invalidating these tariffs to stand, many tariffs will remain in place, including tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles under Section 232, tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 imposed on China during President Trump’s first term, and antidumping and countervailing', summary='Date: 2025-06-30 (approximate, based on article context) | Source: Global Trade & Sanctions Law (Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP) | Legal Status: No specific Lukoil-related allegations or investigations reported | Article discusses the launch of the U.S. DOJ’s new cross-agency Trade Fraud Task Force aimed at combating trade-related fraud, including customs violations, tariff evasion, and false claims under statutes such as the False Claims Act and criminal provisions in Title 18. The Task Force will coordinate enforcement actions involving DOJ Criminal and Civil Divisions, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements, the enforcement of them, and circumstances where they do not apply. This guidance is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct you to further detailed guidance to read alongside it. This document is current on the date of publication. 1. Prohibitions and requirements --------------------------------- The regulations impose financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging Russia to cease actions which destabilise Ukraine, or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. The prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons include British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas. The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 10 of the regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters. It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions. If you are unclear about any aspect of the regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice. Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the regulations are set out below. 1.1 Non-government controlled territory of Ukraine --------------------------------------------------- The territorial scope of certain measures in the regulations is ‘non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’. This is defined in regulation 2 as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts’. ‘Crimea’ is further defined as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. 1.2 Designation of persons --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of the financial and/or director disqualification and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions if they are, or have been, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in [regulation 6 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6)). The regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the purposes of the financial and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) provides details of the people designated under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated. 1.3 Specification of ships --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may specify a ship for the purposes of shipping sanctions if the ship is, has been, or is likely to be, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 57F of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)). The regulations also provide that the Secretary of State must specify a ship by its International Maritime Organization number or, where it is not reasonably practicable to identify it by that number, by any other means that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list)provides details of the ships specified under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been specified. #### The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations 2024 These [regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/made) came into force on 31 July 2024. They amend regulation 57F (specification of ships) so that a ship may be specified for any activity whose object or effect is to: * destabilise Ukraine or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine, or to * obtain a benefit from or support the Government of Russia This includes, but is not limited to, carrying military or dual-use goods from a third country to Russia, as well as oil or oil products that originated in Russia. Ships specified under Regulation 57F will be subject to ‘shipping sanctions’, namely measures in regulations 57A to 57E. Where shipping sanctions apply, a specified ship: * is prohibited from entering a port in the UK * may be given a movement or a port entry direction * can be detained, and * will be refused permission to register on the UK Ship Register or have its existing registration terminated These regulations also amend regulation 6 (designation criteria) to include additional activities for which a person may designated, namely: * providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology to persons involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia (as defined in the Regulations); and * owning or controlling directly or indirectly, or working as a director, trustee, other manager or equivalent of a person, other than an individual, involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine The former expands the criteria under the Regulations to designate entities, including foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions on behalf of, or in support of, specified sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. This in line with G7 commitments to further curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system which Russia is using to facilitate its war in Ukraine. An [explanatory memorandum](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/memorandum/contents) accompanies the regulations, providing further information on their provisions. 1.4 Financial sanctions ------------------------ #### Asset freeze and making available provisions The regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly. These prohibitions also apply in relation to entities owned or controlled by a designated person. The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is the authority for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury. OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. See more information about [how OFSI implements financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-financial-sanctions-guidance). #### Other financial and investment restrictions The regulations prohibit a person from directly or', summary='Date: 2025-07-22 | Source: GOV.UK | Article discusses UK government statutory guidance on Russia sanctions, including financial sanctions enforcement, licensing, and compliance requirements.

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

With an eye on future trends, this week we lead by exploring Web3, the catch-all term for the vision of a new internet which at its core uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. For some it represents a transition from big corporations controlling and monetising content on the internet to individuals sharing content and interacting through decentralised networks. But for others, the notion of a decentralised internet presents many challenges, especially how to identify, prosecute, and prevent financial crime on the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets are inextricably linked to the concept of Web3, so we also deliver the latest news surrounding the world of virtual currencies and renewed efforts by authorities to detect and prevent crime in the sector. In addition, we feature updates on global sanctions, cover the growing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, present you with the most recent reports, legislation & guides, and finally wrap up this week’s Roundup by reviewing the latest news from the world of money laundering. ### **What exactly is Web3?** Web3 isn’t yet fully in existence, so nobody knows exactly how it will work. But most concepts involve the blockchain, an unchangeable ledger system used by cryptocurrencies to keep track of transactions. Some believe that [Web3](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/web3-definition-internet.html) is little more than a rebranding exercise for crypto, others believe it’s a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet, in which every activity and social interaction can be bought and sold. ### **Can a blockchain-based decentralised internet change the world?** The appeal of the blockchain for Web3 supporters is that it logs everything in a way that is transparent and impossible to edit or falsify; each new transaction creates a “block” in the ledger anyone can see. The main issue of the blockchain is the same as its supposed benefit, as nobody can edit the ledger, and anyone can create as many crypto accounts as they want, it’s hard to [address and protect against fraud](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-web3-5271876). ### **Webinar: Experts Take on FinCrime: Web3 and Digital Assets** While Web3 and digital assets have the potential to benefit society, cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols are a central tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. At this upcoming [webinar](https://www.napier.ai/post/web3-financial-risk-compliance) (Wednesday, September 21st, 2022 @ 9:30 am BST) experts from law enforcement and technology vendors will discuss the digital asset ecosystem as it relates to financial crime. ### **Helium: an example of Web3 in action today** [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is a crowdsourced wireless network that rewards users with cryptocurrency for sharing their home network connections. This effectively creates a large network of hotspots that users can access, while the owners of those hotspots can receive compensation in the form of crypto tokens. ### **Crawley Town Football club: The “transformative sports success story of Web 3.0”** While traditional finance was used in the initial purchase of Crawley Town football club, its owners are now harnessing [digital currencies to build a remote community of fans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62136553). In July, Crawley launched their own NFT and for the price of 0.35 Ether (worth £353 at the time of publication) buyers received ‘a virtual season ticket’. ## Money Laundering, Fraud & Corruption ### **Malta-based bank fined for anti-money laundering breaches** A Malta-based bank owned by a Dutch billionaire has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for some [major shortcomings in its anti-money laundering processes](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/bank-owned-dutch-billionaire-fined-antimoney-laundering-breaches.978758). Novum Bank, owned by Dutch entrepreneur Marcel Boekhoorn, was hit with an €89,000 fine and ordered to tighten up its checks on clients. ### **Opinion: call for a European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime** The increasing complexity of EU financial and anti-financial crime regulation has made it increasingly difficult for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) to keep up with regulatory developments. This has led to growing calls for the establishment of a [European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/need-european-centre-excellence-antimoney-laundering-compliance.979691) to provide training and guidance, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. ### **Report: The biggest money laundering risks must be given top priority** De Nederlandsche Bank has published a [report on preventing and combating financial crime](https://www.dnb.nl/en/general-news/2022/biggest-money-laundering-risks-must-be-given-top-priority/). Entitled ‘From recovery to balance’, it argues for more risk-based customer due diligence and recommends focussing on the high-risk customer categories. ### **Money laundering through Payment Gateways and Buy Now Pay Later schemes** The Covid-19 pandemic threw India’s economy into chaos and Chinese scammers took advantage by flooding the market with legitimate-looking micro-loan and betting apps, which they turned out to be scandalous and robbed thousands of users of their money. Many companies are now facing scrutiny as their [due-diligence methods failed](https://regtechtimes.com/money-laundering-through-payment-gateway/) to prevent transactions with fraudulent merchants. ### **Regulator details “Frankly shocking” AML breaches at Sydney casino** Star Entertainment Group, Australia’s second biggest operator, has been found unfit to hold a casino licence in Sydney. An inquiry by Australia’s New South Wales state gambling regulator into alleged [breaches of anti-money laundering laws and criminal infiltration](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-state-regulator-says-star-unfit-hold-casino-licence-2022-09-13/), identified “systemic governance, risk and cultural failures”. ### **Webinar: Money laundering through the property sector: Headline cases in review** While the property sector has faced increasingly stringent anti-money laundering regulations across the globe, often these regulations are poorly enforced. Public records can go a long way toward flagging and investigating suspicious real estate transactions, particularly when records are centralised, networked, and searchable. Join this webinar on September 28 at 1pm ET for a discussion on money laundering in the real estate market and examples of how to trace nefarious actors’ real estate assets in Sayari Graph. ## Legislation, Regulation and Sustainability ### **Report: FATF and INTERPOL intensify global asset recovery** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and INTERPOL have launched a [joint initiative](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/methodsandtrends/documents/fatf-interpol-2022.html) to increase global efforts to recover illicit assets. While asset recovery is key to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, it is estimated that countries intercept and recover less than one per cent of global illicit financial flows. ### **FATF Report: Japan strengthens measures to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing** Since the 2021 assessment, Japan has taken several actions to strengthen its framework. As a result, the FATF has [re-rated the country](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fur-japan-2022.html) on Recommendation 2 from Partially Compliant to Largely Compliant. Japan is now compliant on 4 Recommendations, largely compliant on 25, and partially compliant on 9 Recommendations. Japan will remain in enhanced follow up and will continue to inform the FATF of its progress. ### **Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry on illicit finance – evidence deadline 27 September** The deadline for submissions of initial written evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee’s ‘[Responding to illicit and emerging finance](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6495/)’ inquiry has been extended to Tuesday 27 Sept 2022. The inquiry, announced on 1 Feb 2022, will assess the effectiveness of the UK’s response to the challenge of cross-border illicit finance and builds on the “Moscow’s Gold” report. ### **FCA calls on the financial industries to ‘embed’ the use of data and technology** An executive director of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has called on the financial industries to [‘embed’ the use of data and technology](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fighting-financial-crime-force-multiplier-effect) in order to ward off financial crime. Speaking at The Financial Crime Summit, Sarah Pritchard warned that financial crime would worsen in light of the cost-of-living crisis and advised firms to plan how they will respond to the increased risks. “My message to all firms is this: embed your financial crime checks in your systems from day one, but keep evolving as the threats evolve,” she said. “Use the power of data and tech, and stay alert for situations in which you may need to recalibrate your defences and alerts.” Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets, FCA ### **Quick Guide: Money laundering through the gambling industry** The Basel Institute on Governance has published a quick [guide](https://baselgovernance.org/publications/quick-guide-28-money-laundering-through-gambling-industry) which sets out how criminals abuse the gambling industry to launder illicit funds.

По данным ФБР, Семёнов, являясь экспертом в области блокчейн-технологий, использовал свои навыки для разработки криптовалютного миксера Tornado Cash. Сервис, изначально позиционировавшийся как инструмент для обеспечения анонимности транзакций, на практике превратился в крупный механизм по отмыванию денег. Через [Tornado Cash](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=Tornado+Cash) было отмыто более 1 миллиарда долларов преступных доходов. Как предполагает ФБР, в апреле и мае 2022 года сервис Tornado Cash предположительно использовался Lazarus Group, северокорейской организацией по киберпреступности, находящейся под санкциями, для отмывания сотен миллионов долларов доходов. Семенов и его сообщники якобы знали, что сервис Tornado Cash, которым они управляли, участвовал в этих нарушающих санкции транзакциях. Они якобы продолжали управлять сервисом и способствовать проведению сотен миллионов долларов, помогая Lazarus Group переводить преступные доходы с криптовалютного кошелька, который был обозначен Управлением по контролю за иностранными активами как заблокированное имущество. 21 августа 2023 года федеральный суд США выдал ордер на арест Семёнова. Ему предъявлены обвинения в сговоре с целью отмывания денег, ведении нелицензированного бизнеса по переводу денежных средств и нарушении Закона о международных чрезвычайных экономических полномочиях. В настоящее время местонахождение Семёнова неизвестно: он может находиться в России, Турции или Объединенных Арабских Эмиратах — в этих странах у него есть установленные связи. В объявлении о розыске его описывают как белого мужчину с каштановыми/коричневыми волосами и зелеными глазами, хотя не исключается, что он мог изменить внешность.

Решение вынес судья Бранислав Лекович. По заявлению защиты, залог должен был быть выплачен наличными, и деньги поступили от невесты подсудимого Озмен. Защита приложила справки с места её работы, дохода и остатка на банковском счёте. Однако, рассмотрев представленные доказательства и заявления, суд пришёл к выводу о несоблюдении законного требования об установлении залога, поскольку не было представлено ни действительного письменного согласия поручителя, ни доказательств того, что указанная сумма была фактически предоставлена \\u200b\\u200bсуду. Судья Лекович посчитал, что предложенный залог не даёт достаточных гарантий того, что ответчик не покинет Черногорию и не будет препятствовать производству по делу. – Суд считает, что предложенный залог не гарантирует, что обвиняемый не скроется, учитывая тяжесть преступления и объем подозрительных финансовых операций, – говорится в мотивировочной части решения. Адвокат подсудимого предложил освободить его подзащитного из-под стражи с возможным применением к нему мер пресечения, таких как запрет на выезд из Черногории и изъятие паспорта. Однако суд счёл, что обстоятельства дела не изменились по сравнению с предыдущими решениями о продлении срока содержания под стражей. В решении Высшего суда также говорится, что это уже третье ходатайство защиты с просьбой об освобождении подсудимого под залог, которое, как и предыдущее, было отклонено как необоснованное. Он купил лимузины и квартиры в Подгорице. Согласно обвинительному заключению СДТ, подозреваемый приобретал роскошные автомобили и недвижимость в Подгорице с 2023 по начало 2025 года, выдавая деньги неизвестного происхождения за законное приобретение. В обвинительном заключении указано, что покупки были совершены наличными и включали в себя автомобили класса люкс и квартиры в столице. Обвинение утверждает, что этими действиями обвиняемый пытался легализовать денежные средства, полученные незаконным путём. Обвиняемый находится под стражей, в отношении него за рубежом ведутся другие уголовные дела по аналогичным преступлениям. Суд напомнил, что Озмен обвиняется в совершении тяжкого преступления, связанного с отмыванием денег в течение длительного времени, которое карается тюремным заключением сроком на несколько лет, что еще больше увеличивает риск побега. Специальная государственная прокуратура предъявила обвинение гражданину Турции по подозрению в отмывании денег, полученных преступным путём на территории Черногории в течение длительного периода. Прокуратура обвиняет его в приобретении автомобилей класса люкс и недвижимости на территории Черногории в 2023 и 2024 годах за счёт средств, законное происхождение которых ему не было доказано. Согласно обвинительному заключению, Озмен несколько раз совершал сделки с наличными, приобретая такие автомобили, как Lamborghini Aventador, Mercedes AMG G63, Porsche Cayenne и Range Rover Velar, на общую сумму более 700 000 евро. Кроме того, он приобрёл несколько квартир в Подгорице на общую сумму более миллиона евро, при этом он якобы «ложно указал происхождение денег». В ходе обыска квартиры и автомобиля обвиняемого полиция обнаружила крупную сумму наличных денег, ценные часы Rolex, ювелирные изделия, несколько ноутбуков, а также документацию, связанную с куплей-продажей недвижимости и транспортных средств. Судебно-медицинская экспертиза выявила следы кокаина на нескольких банкнотах, обнаруженных обвиняемым. Согласно обвинительному заключению, Озмен отрицал, что получил деньги преступным путём, утверждая, что заработал их на видеороликах в социальной сети YouTube и занял часть средств у друзей. Однако отчёты полицейского управления и таможенных органов свидетельствуют о том, что в документах отсутствуют данные о легальном ввозе в страну более крупных сумм. Судебное слушание по этому обвинению еще не назначено, а в Турции против Озмена уже ведется судебное разбирательство по подозрению в организации незаконных азартных игр и отмывании денег. Обвиняемый находится в следственном изоляторе Спуж с 28 января. https://www.dan.co.me/vijesti/hronika/sud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003 [![Image 1: Sud odbio jemstvo državljaninu Turske osumnjičenom za pranje novca: Vjerenica nudila 700.000 eura za slobodu](https://external.fagc3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/emg1/v/t13/8999273576366829258?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dan.co.me%2Fimages%2Fslike%2Fnew%2F2025%2F10%2F30%2F2006653.jpg&fb_obo=1&utld=co.me&stp=c0.5000x0.5000f_dst-jpg_flffffff_p1000x522_q75_tt6&_nc_gid=U5lYJp51jSZCg8xNcVr_Ng&_nc_oc=AdmxFR6t991tX4wwTTjhOaW1pY0xbBNvuWFjFGKdUbOOPWyfP2qctUSRzoTkAYFIgqI&ccb=13-1&oh=06_Q3-4AceN-kRqHx6CT5ozPFkyZaIfUGkvNPyAl1eWM8-vU9m5&oe=690E9723&_nc_sid=d86115)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dan.co.me%2Fvijesti%2Fhronika%2Fsud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003&h=AT19CBvbMHry-Fvb1pXW_HnUEYIgeRIUltOMD9fZ2YsP2l0Gf9D8nx74ZBS1YKt6qdjTEKIvW35nFsbOrLu68Y6vYUCfW9T5RgVlJW1lV0npwZAytZMd7NESUTdfAVUagUP6cIsuw6OQSpv4F2ongO5i1Q&__tn__=H-R&c[0]=AT0-zeE629v1lSS0VVVZu49nx99XVjGa2oYmuZUHAXMqcANof1HfYTp95BG6NUBgnqrfKoxJ-aHfaaGmdmM50Xw4MqLtUinX2ERMClVRAC8kNw9K2m49J3EFi6wQt7d3cyQmO7GiJ1cxjD7ZFXbxXHX9UWTZQj-eVAOIyVQ3JV4TPSXVI4E5W39V9h6OxMAV3BfrxnORGiHvcdLr_HwVMn2yvIMu5VrHqQw) [dan.co.me Sud odbio jemstvo državljaninu Turske osumnjičenom za pranje novca: Vjerenica nudila 700.000 eura za slobodu Viši sud u Podgorici odbio je predlog odbrane turskog državljanina Erkana Ozmena, osumnjičenog za produženo krivično djelo pranje novca, da bude pušten iz pritvora uz jemstvo od 700.000 eura.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dan.co.me%2Fvijesti%2Fhronika%2Fsud-odbio-jemstvo-drzavljaninu-turske-osumnjicenom-za-pranje-novca-vjerenica-nudila-700-000-eura-za-slobodu-5322003&h=AT19CBvbMHry-Fvb1pXW_HnUEYIgeRIUltOMD9fZ2YsP2l0Gf9D8nx74ZBS1YKt6qdjTEKIvW35nFsbOrLu68Y6vYUCfW9T5RgVlJW1lV0npwZAytZMd7NESUTdfAVUagUP6cIsuw6OQSpv4F2ongO5i1Q&__tn__=%2CmH-R&c[0]=AT0-zeE629v1lSS0VVVZu49nx99XVjGa2oYmuZUHAXMqcANof1HfYTp95BG6NUBgnqrfKoxJ-aHfaaGmdmM50Xw4MqLtUinX2ERMClVRAC8kNw9K2m49J3EFi6wQt7d3cyQmO7GiJ1cxjD7ZFXbxXHX9UWTZQj-eVAOIyVQ3JV4TPSXVI4E5W39V9h6OxMAV3BfrxnORGiHvcdLr_HwVMn2yvIMu5VrHqQw) ![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/85d8b181a20aeb64a3afc2f1c39d2480) All reactions: 4 Like Comment Share See more on Facebook See more on Facebook Email or phone number Password Log In [Forgot password?](https://www.facebook.com/recover/initiate?ars=royal_blue_bar) or Create new account', summary='Date: 2024-10-30 | Source: dan.co.me | Legal Status: Ongoing | Turkish citizen Erkan Ozmen is under criminal investigation and detention in Montenegro for prolonged money laundering offenses from 2023 to early 2025.

Police found large amounts of cash, luxury watches, jewelry, laptops, and transaction documents during searches. Forensic analysis detected cocaine traces on some banknotes. Ozmen denies illicit origins, claiming income from YouTube videos and loans from friends, but customs and police reports show no legal import records for large sums. He faces related criminal proceedings in Turkey for illegal gambling and money laundering. The Montenegrin High Court rejected bail set at €700,000 offered by his fiancée due to flight risk and severity of charges. No court hearing date set yet.

на 1,7 млрд долларов.** Согласно [информации](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/seven-members-moscow-based-criminal-organization-plead-guilty-over-17-billion) Офиса прокурора США в Восточном округе Нью-Йорка, семь членов организованной преступной группировки, находящейся в Москве, признаны виновными в схеме по организации масштабной международной схемы мошенничества в сфере медицины и отмывании денег: они выставили поддельные счета более 50 аптекам на сумму свыше 1,7 миллиардов долларов. Сообщники действовали по всей стране, включая Нью-Йорк, Бруклин, Лонг-Айленд, Статен-Айленд, Нью-Джерси, Техас и др. Лидер группы, гражданин США Брайн Саттон, 31 год, находящийся в Москве, управлял преступной деятельностью из российской столицы, он остается на свободе. Среди обвиняемых значатся: Хафизула Эбади, Джошуа Мануэль Алегрия, Дэвид Гэри Бишофф, Брайсен Кей Миллетт, Дела Сайдазим, Энтони Сантамария и Хершель Цикман, они признали себя виновными. Ответчики участвовали в международной схеме по приобретению аптек по всей территории Соединенных Штатов, имея ранее существовавшие отношения с частными компаниями медицинского страхования. Эти аптеки вместе с колл-центрами использовались, чтобы побудить людей принимать ненужные лекарства, для чего выписывались мошеннические рецепты в аптеках схемы — на этом сеть нанятых врачей и обвиняемые заработали более 1,7 миллиарда долларов. Обвинения против Саттона и других были объявлены 7 ноября 2023 года. Следствие выяснило, что преступная группа выставила мошеннические счета в период с 2017 по 2022 год. Сообщники Саттона обеспечивали поиск аптек, врачей и открытие колл-центров, первые из которых открылись в штате Юта, а вскоре сеть расширилась в другие страны, включая Россию. Сотрудники колл-центров звонили клиентам с предложением купить лекарства по низкой цене без предварительного медобследования. Практикующие медсестры и помощники врачей выписывали рецепты после телемедицинских консультаций, зачастую обманывая врачей о проведении этих визитов, которые фактически не осуществлялись. Рецепты оформлялись на имена врачей и номера их идентификаторов, в результате чего многие бенефициары так и не получили обещанные медикаменты. Для отмывания денег мошенники использовали подставные компании, а также вымышленные персональные данные и средства связи. В преступной группе работали IT-специалисты, которые настраивали программное обеспечение для управления аптечной сетью. Они подготавливали и подавали заявки на возмещение «расходов» в частные страховые компании. В итоге преступникам удалось получить от страховых компаний свыше $500 миллионов. Сроки тюремного заключения, которые грозят членам преступной группы, варьируются от 10 до 30 лет, в то время как некоторым простоит конфискация имущества и штрафы в размере от 1,8 до 520 миллионов долларов. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/10/29/members-of-moscow-criminal-organization-guilty/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Legal Status: No financial crime or compliance information found | Article and website content reviewed contain no information related to money laundering allegations, AML deficiencies, sanctions violations, fraud, corruption, or compliance actions involving Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.4),\n",

Об этом [сообщается на сайте](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0225) американского Минфина. Ведомство называет Grinex наследницей закрывшейся российской криптобиржи Garantex, которая, по его данным, «напрямую содействовала» киберпреступникам и обработала с 2019 года трансакции, связанные с незаконной деятельностью, на более чем $100 миллионов. Минфин США внес Garantex в санкционный список в апреле 2022 года. Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex, как утверждает ведомство, для уклонения от ограничительных мер. Garantex, основанная в 2019 году в Эстонии и ведущая деятельность в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, по данным Минфина США, обслуживала даркнет-рынки и группы операторов программ-вымогателей, включая Conti, LockBit и Ryuk. В феврале 2022 года компания Garantex лишилась эстонской лицензии на предоставление услуг в сфере цифровых активов после того, как подразделение финансовой разведки Эстонии выявило критические нарушения в системе противодействия отмыванию денег и финансированию терроризма (AML/CFT) и обнаружило связи между Garantex и кошельками, используемыми для преступной деятельности. В марте 2025 года американские и европейские правоохранители заблокировали домен Garantex и заморозили $26 миллионов, после чего клиенты и активы были переведены на новую площадку — Grinex. В пресс-релизе Минфина США подчеркивается, что Grinex была создана сотрудниками Garantex специально «для обхода санкций». Кроме того, под санкции Минфина США попали трое руководителей Garantex — ее сооснователь Сергей Менделеев, коммерческий директор Александр Мира Серда и региональный директор Павел Каравацкий — и шесть компаний из России и Кыргызстана, которые, как заявило ведомство, «поддерживали участие биржи во вредоносной кибердеятельности». Это кыргызстанская Old Vector, а также российские A7, A71 и A7 Agent, участвовавшие в выпуске рублевого стейблкоина A7A5. Его, по версии Управления по контролю за иностранными активами Министерства финансов США, Garantex использовала для перевода средств клиентам и обхода ограничений. Кроме того, под американские санкции попали проекты InDeFi Bank и Exved.

Garantex lost its Estonian license in February 2022 due to critical AML violations. In March 2025, U.S. and European authorities blocked Garantex’s domain and froze $26 million in assets, after which customers and assets were moved to Grinex, allegedly created by former Garantex employees to evade sanctions. The Treasury also sanctioned three Garantex executives and six companies supporting illicit activities. The sanctions include accusations of using a ruble stablecoin (A7A5) to circumvent restrictions. The article mentions U.S. sanctions against Lukoil but provides no details on financial crimes, AML violations, or compliance issues related to Lukoil itself.\\n\\nDate: 2023-10-10 | Source: 24.kg (implied from related links) | Legal Status: Alleged | U.S. sanctions announced against Lukoil (alongside Rosneft) for unspecified reasons related to sanctions enforcement.

Согласно [обвинительному заключению,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25029923-cryptonator-complaint) Пикулев и его соучастники управляли Cryptonator с 2014 года до марта 2023 года. Платформа осуществляла международную схему отмывания денег, предоставляя услуги преимущественно преступникам. Cryptonator принимала средства, полученные в результате многочисленных компьютерных взломов, атак с использованием программ-вымогателей, мошенничества и кражи личных данных, пишет [Securitylab](https://www.securitylab.ru/news/550792.php). Cryptonator никогда не регистрировалась в американской Сети по борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями (FinCEN), что является федеральным преступлением. В Министерстве юстиции утверждают, что платформа не имела значимых процессов по противодействию отмыванию денег и эффективной программы контроля. Пикулев осознавал, что обрабатываемые им средства были получены преступным путём или предназначены для поддержки преступной деятельности. Киберпреступники использовали платформу для обмена криптовалютой и вывода средств в фиатную валюту. Пикулев внедрил в Cryptonator функции, которые анонимизировали источник средств. В официальных документах Пикулев также использовал псевдоним «BOSS». Он управлял платформой через множество IT-провайдеров из США и размещал рекламу в американских соцсетях для продвижения сервиса. Также следователи получили ордер на обыск электронного адреса, использованного Пикулевым для регистрации cryptonator.com. Всего платформа обработала более 4 миллионов транзакций на сумму $1,4 миллиарда, при этом Пикулев получал небольшой процент с каждой транзакции. По [данным](https://www.trmlabs.com/post/us-and-german-authorities-seize-crypto-wallet-cryptonator-and-charge-administrator) TRM Labs, информация показывает многочисленные транзакции и связи Cryptonator с другими преступными рынками – Blender, Hydra Market, Bitzlato, Garantex и т.д. Биткойн-адреса, контролируемые Cryptonator, напрямую и косвенно отправили или получили: * более $25 млн. с даркнет-маркетов или мошеннических магазинов; * более $34,5 млн. с адресов мошенников; * более $80 млн. с высокорисковых бирж; * более $8 млн. с адресов, связанных с группами вымогателей; * более $54 млн. с адресов, связанных с кражей криптовалют в результате взломов; * более $34 млн. с криптомиксеров; * более $71 млн. с адресов, находящимися под санкциями. Пикулев использовал удостоверения личности и документы разных стран для регистрации сайтов и электронных адресов. Министерство юстиции не ответило на запросы о местонахождении Пикулева и о том, был ли он задержан.

and operator of the unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange Cryptonator, with money laundering. Cryptonator allegedly processed over $235 million in illicit funds from 2014 to March 2023, including proceeds from cybercrimes such as hacks, ransomware attacks, fraud, and identity theft. The platform never registered with FinCEN, violating U.S. AML regulations, and lacked effective AML controls and suspicious transaction monitoring. Pikulev reportedly implemented features to anonymize the source of funds and used multiple identities and IT providers to operate the service. Cryptonator handled over 4 million transactions totaling approximately $1.4 billion, with links to darknet markets, sanctioned addresses, mixers, and high-risk exchanges. Investigations remain open; Pikulev’s whereabouts and custody status are unknown. No information or allegations involve Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.32),\n",

Об этом [пишет](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chen-zhi-scam-singapore-police-b2859031.html) Independent. В середине октября 2025 года прокуратура США предъявила предпринимателю обвинения в сговоре с целью мошенничества с использованием электронных средств связи и в сговоре с целью отмывания денег. Как следует из обвинительного заключения, жертвами злоумышленников под эгидой Prince Holding Group стали 250 человек на территории США. В рамках расследования американские власти изъяли биткоинов более чем на $14 млрд. Одновременно власти Великобритании объявили об аресте в Северном Лондоне особняка стоимостью $15,6 млн и офисного здания за $130 млн. Правительства США и Великобритании также ввели совместные санкции против Чжи и его компании. [Российского криптомошенника Пичугина депортируют из Камбоджи](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/68a599ce9a79470187bbf88f) [Общество](https://www.rbc.ru/society/) Затем к расследованию присоединился Сингапур. Местные силовики арестовали финансовые активы Чэня на $114 млн, а также несколько яхт с коллекцией дорогостоящего алкоголя. Четвертого ноября тайваньская прокуратура задержала по делу Чэня 25 подозреваемых и конфисковала у камбоджийского бизнесмена активы на сумму $150 млн. В тот же день полиция Гонконга объявила об изъятии активов Чэня Чжи в виде наличных и акций еще на $353 млн. Prince Holding Group — камбоджийский конгломерат со штаб-квартирой в Пномпене и с дочерними компаниями в десятках стран. У холдинга интересы в разных сферах — недвижимость, финансы, авиация, туризм, логистика, высокие технологии и пищевая промышленность. [На сайте компании](https://www.princeholdinggroup.com/) указано, что она является одним из крупнейших конгломератов Камбоджи. 38-летний Чэнь Чжи, помимо камбоджийского паспорта, имеет гражданство Китая, где он родился. Как выяснило [Associated Press](http://www.ap.org/), Чэнь все еще [остается на свободе](https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-us-uk-online-scam-prince-chen-zhi-bbc3fae393003a16cda22efd5a2ada22). В случае признания его виновным в США ему грозит до 40 лет тюрьмы. Prince Holding Group ранее опровергала свою причастность к мошенническим операциям и публично не отреагировала на последние обвинения. В МВД Камбоджи заявили, что готовы сотрудничать со следователями других государств при наличии официального запроса, подтвержденного доказательствами. **Читайте РБК в [Telegram](https://t.me/+o--H2lU_IO83NmUy).** Поделиться Поделиться Вконтакте Одноклассники Telegram [РБК в MAX](https://max.ru/rbc) [На связи с проверенными новостями](https://max.ru/rbc) [Читайте РБК в MAX!

Свои предложения он опубликовал в [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid023LmPDPQUpAEQJtKNy6Ex6Lr6sPS3CorrgwMhZgBcurhmDddjmftJvpJ76urEi7obl&id=100075452118676&locale=ru_RU), сообщает [Orda.kz](orda.kz).** Марат Башимов рассказал, что направил письмо с предложениями генпрокурору Берику Асылову. Депутат хочет не просто вернуть государству выведенные за рубеж деньги, но и провести «расширенную конфискацию». По словам депутата, во многих странах учли рекомендации ФАТФ и внесли соответствующие изменения в законодательство. Раньше принять такие законы было невозможно из-за активного противостояния лоббистов, но сейчас это сделать необходимо, считает Башимов. Казахстан не полностью ратифицировал конвенцию ООН по борьбе с коррупцией, но всё равно является её участником — а это значит, что страна должна бороться с незаконным обогащением не только чиновников, но и членов их семей. > «Сейчас из-за того, что этой нормы нет, и активы переписаны на третьих лиц, многие уходят от ответственности, их имущество не конфискуется в полном объёме, а осуждённый «сидит» спокойно, зная, что у него не забрали то, что переписано на третьих лиц, родственников, любовниц и так далее. И этими активами и деньгами он завтра будет наслаждаться».Марат Башимов Мажилисмен указывает: в законодательстве есть понятие «имущество, приобретённое преступным путем». И оно относится в том числе к имуществу, которым владеют третьи лица. Например, члены семьи, сообщники по уголовным делам, аффилированные юрлица. Сюда же попадают активы, подаренные или за бесценок проданные «на сторону». > «При расширенной конфискации нет необходимости в отдельном судебном разбирательстве и вынесении обвинительного приговора в отношении предшествующей преступной деятельности, в результате которой предположительно были получены активы. Поскольку предполагаемая предшествующая преступная деятельность не нуждается в уточнении. Расширенную конфискацию можно применять лишь в отношении имущества, законность приобретения которого лицо объяснить не может. Механизм предлагается следующий: лицу, в отношении которого начато досудебное производство, предлагается доказать законность приобретения остального имущества. Если он не сможет доказать, то оно подлежит конфискации», — развивает свою мысль депутат. Марат Башимов уточнил, что расширенную конфискацию нужно применять не ко всем подряд — но в первую очередь под неё должны попадать отдельные категории госслужащих и политиков, а также те, кто работает на руководящих постах в госструктурах. Тем временем другие депутаты мажилиса, напротив, предложили [провести амнистию капиталов](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) — и простить казахстанским олигархам вывод денег из страны в обмен на их возвращение в родную экономику. **Читайте также:** * [Возврат активов: почему нельзя просто забрать элитную недвижимость казахстанцев в ОАЭ](https://orda.kz/vozvrat-aktivov-pochemu-nelzja-prosto-zabrat-jelitnuju-nedvizhimost-kazahstancev-v-oaje-399460/) * [Олигархи инвестируют 10,5 млрд долларов в экономику Казахстана](https://orda.kz/oligarhi-investirujut-105-mlrd-dollarov-v-jekonomiku-kazahstana-400481/) * [Понять и простить: казахстанским олигархам разрешат законно вернуть деньги в страну](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) [возврат активов](/tag/vozvrat-aktivov/) [казахстан](/tag/kazahstan/) [мажилис](/tag/mazhilis/) [марат башимов](/tag/marat-bashimov/) ## Лента новостей * [Токаев встретился с Госсекретарем США Марком Рубио и представителями администрации Дональда Трампа](/tokaev-vstretilsja-s-gossekretarem-ssha-markom-rubio-i-predstaviteljami-administracii-donalda-trampa-408811/) * [Что позволено женщине, то не позволено мужчине?

Его заподозрили в коррупции и отмывании денег, сообщает The Guardian, ссылаясь на документы федерального уголовного суда Швейцарии. Следствие, согласно документам, пытается установить происхождение состояния Абрамовича, которое он приобрел в России в 1990-х и 2000-х годах. Среди прочего власти острова в рамках расследования запросили данные о счетах в швейцарских банках, которые связывают с бизнесменом. Суд в Швейцарии, несмотря на попытки адвокатов Абрамовича заблокировать обмен документами, постановил, что эту информацию можно передать властям Джерси. Один запрос касается подозрений в отмывании денег, полученных Абрамовичем при продаже компании «Сибнефть» за 13 миллиардов долларов в 2005 году. Второе дело связано с возможным нарушением санкций из-за переводов, совершенных после того, как бизнесмена включили в санкционный список острова Джерси в 2022 году. Абрамович через своих адвокатов отверг все обвинения и заявил, что любые предположения о его причастности к преступной деятельности не соответствуют действительности. Власти острова Джерси весной 2022 года [заблокировали](https://meduza.io/news/2022/04/13/sud-ostrova-dzhersi-zamorozil-aktivy-romana-abramovicha-na-7-milliardov-dollarov) активы Романа Абрамовича на семь миллиардов долларов, сообщал Bloomberg. Это произошло вскоре после того, как власти Евросоюза и Великобритании ввели санкции против бизнесмена из-за полномасштабного вторжения войск России в Украину. Журнал Forbes [оценивает](https://www.forbes.ru/profile/roman-abramovich) состояние Абрамовича в 9,2 миллиарда долларов.

One inquiry concerns suspected laundering of proceeds from the $13 billion sale of Sibneft in 2005. Another case involves potential sanctions violations related to transfers made after Abramovich was sanctioned by Jersey in 2022. Abramovich denies all allegations.

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison». Dans le «lobby», beaucoup de gens parlent russe. «C’est un peu la nouvelle rue du Rhône en beaucoup plus moderne», estime un acteur du secteur qui, lui, est toujours\", summary='Date: 2023-11-21 | Source: Public Eye | Legal Status: No direct allegations or findings | Article reports that since Western sanctions and embargoes on Russian oil (effective December 2022 for crude and February 2023 for refined products), Dubai’s DMCC free zone has become a preferred hub for trading Russian oil, attracting many companies formerly operating from Switzerland.

C’est ce qu’a annoncé, par communiqué, la filiale de Sonatrach, sur sa page Facebook, jeudi dernier. Comparativement aux autres bien saisis, ces stations constituent un « menu fretin » de l’ensemble des biens publics détournés par les responsables communément désignés la « issa-ba ». Les plus importantes récupérations sont les « 30 milliards de dollars entre biens immobiliers, unités industrielles et sommes d'argent » annoncés par le président Abdelmadjid Tebboune lors de son dis-cours à la nation du 25 décembre 1923. Ce sont 350 entreprises, 15 000 ha de terrains, 12 000 logements, etc. C’est également l’usine de production d’acier de M’sila, récupérée et reversée à l’entreprise publique « Fondal » lors de la visite du Premier ministre, Sifi Ghrieb, au début de ce mois. C’est le complexe de production de matériaux de construction d’El Meniaâ. Une liste trop longue à énumérer dans cet espace. Ceci pour dire que la lutte contre la corruption se poursuit avec la même détermination depuis 2019. Dans une première phase, l’État s’était attelé à préparer les outils spécifiques nécessaires à la lutte. Il y a eu le cadre juridique avec la loi 22-08. Il y a eu la création de la Haute Autorité de transparence, de prévention et de lutte contre la corruption (HATPLC). Sans oublier les partenariats et conventions signés par l’Algérie avec les États et organismes étrangers. Bref, pendant ce temps, la justice suivait son cours, lent mais inexorable. Tout le monde a pu suivre les « ballets » incessants des convois entre les différentes prisons et les tribunaux devant lesquels ont été traduits les membres de la « Issaba ». Après les juge-ments définitifs des biens saisis, c’est le temps de la réintégra-tion comme nous l’avons vu plus haut. Si les avoirs bancaires récupérés sont reversés au Trésor public, les biens physiques comme les industries sont réintégrés dans le circuit écono-mique du pays. En les versant dans le patrimoine des entre-prises publiques. Ce qui sauve les emplois et participe à la création de richesses dans le pays. En marge de sa visite à M’sila, Sifi Ghrieb, a déclaré que « le Gouvernement est déter-miné à poursuivre la relance des projets confisqués dans le cadre de la lutte contre la corruption, car il s'agit de l'argent du peuple et les citoyens doivent pouvoir en profiter ». À Chlef, le 16 octobre dernier, il a inspecté le complexe spécia-lisé dans la fabrication des conserves de produits de la pêche saisi par la justice et intégré au groupe « AGRODIV ». Il a demandé aux responsables du groupe « d'accélérer le proces-sus de relance de cette unité industrielle…en vue de contri-buer à la création d'emplois dans la wilaya ». Le temps des « moissons » se poursuit. La lutte contre la corruption aussi. Avec la même détermination. On ne le dit pas assez !

LE MINISTRE FRANÇAIS DE L’INTÉRIEUR ESPÈRE RELANCER LE DIALOGUE AVEC L’ALGÉRIE P 2 LIRE EN PAGE 24 P 24 ACTUALITÉ 2 Lundi 20 octobre 2025 PÉKIN ACCUEILLE LA CONFÉRENCE DES FEMMES PARLEMENTAIRES AFRICAINES L’APN pour un partenariat au service de l’égalité et du développement inclusif L es travaux de la Conférence des femmes parlementaires africaines ont débuté hier à Pékin, réunissant des repré-sentantes de plusieurs pays du continent, dont une délégation algérienne. Cette rencontre, axée sur la coopération parle-mentaire et la promotion des droits des femmes, se poursuivra jusqu’au 28 octobre. Sous le thème ambitieux « Le renforcement de la coopération et de l’échange entre les institutions législa-tives, au service de la promotion des questions de la femme dans le monde », la Conférence des femmes parlemen-taires africaines s’est ouverte, dimanche, dans la capitale chinoise Pékin. L’événe-ment, qui s’inscrit dans la continuité du dialogue afro-asiatique sur le rôle des femmes dans la gouvernance et le déve-loppement durable, réunit des parlemen-taires venues du Ghana, du Mozambique, de la Zambie, du Sénégal, du Burundi, ainsi que d’Algérie, représentée par une délégation des deux chambres du Parle-ment. Selon un communiqué de l’Assem-blée populaire nationale, la participation algérienne illustre « la volonté constante de l’Algérie de promouvoir la place des femmes dans la vie politique et de renfor-cer la coopération Sud-Sud dans le domaine législatif ». La séance d’ouvertu-re a, d’ailleurs, été marquée par l’inter-vention de la représentante du Parlement algérien, qui a mis en avant les avancées réalisées en matière d’égalité des genres et de participation féminine à la vie publique, tout en appelant à intensifier les échanges d’expériences entre institu-tions africaines. Au programme de cette première journée figurent plusieurs conférences spécialisées suivies de débats interactifs autour de trois axes principaux : la protection des droits et la garantie de l’égalité entre les sexes, l’au-tonomisation des femmes pour un déve-loppement inclusif, et le partage d’un destin commun et la construction d’une société avec un avenir commun pour l’humanité. Ces thématiques traduisent la volonté de renforcer le rôle des femmes parlementaires dans la formula-tion de politiques publiques capables de répondre aux défis économiques, sociaux et environnementaux du continent afri-cain. La Conférence constitue également une plateforme d’échanges sur les straté-gies législatives visant à réduire les inéga-lités, promouvoir l’éducation des filles, améliorer la représentativité féminine dans les institutions politiques et encou-rager la coopération interparlementaire en matière de droits humains. En marge des travaux, plusieurs rencontres bilaté-rales sont prévues entre les délégations participantes, notamment pour examiner les possibilités de partenariats législatifs et de projets communs dans le domaine de la gouvernance inclusive. La participa-tion de l’Algérie, souvent citée comme modèle dans la région pour son engage-ment en faveur de la représentation fémi-nine au sein des instances élues, s’inscrit dans la continuité des réformes entre-prises ces dernières années pour renfor-cer la présence des femmes dans la sphè-re publique. Les travaux de la Conféren-ce se poursuivront jusqu’au 28 octobre et devraient aboutir à une déclaration com-mune visant à consolider la coopération africaine et à promouvoir une vision par-tagée du rôle des femmes parlementaires dans la construction d’un avenir plus équitable et solidaire. M. Seghilani LE MINISTRE FRANÇAIS DE L’INTÉRIEUR ESPÈRE RELANCER LE DIALOGUE AVEC L’ALGÉRIE Signe de bonne volonté ou simple ruse politique ? Laurent Nunez estime qu'il devait y avoir un « bougé » dans les relations avec l'Algérie, affirmant qu’une remise en cause de l'accord de 1968 n'était pas « à l'ordre du jour ». L es relations franco-algé-riennes vont-elles connaitre un réchauffe-ment ? C’est la question que se posent de nombreux observateurs politiques qui estiment que le départ de l’ancien pensionnaire de l’hô-tel Beauvau, siège du minis-tère de l’Intérieur, Bruno Retailleau, va créer une situa-tion de désescalade qui va permettre de renouer le dia-logue et tourner la page des tensions vécues cet été entre Alger et Paris. Le nouveau ministre de l’Intérieur, Lau-rent Nunez, est un fils d’émi-grés espagnols qui ont vécu à Oran après leur fuite d’Es-pagne durant la guerre civile qui avait permis à ex-roi Fran-co de prendre le pouvoir. Et même s’il est un militant du parti Renaissance, il semble ne pas cultiver de haine à l’égard des français d’ori-gines étrangères. La gauche lui reproche toutefois son rôle dans la répression du mouvement des Gilets jaunes quand il était préfet de police. Invité de France Inter/France Info/Le Monde, hier dimanche, il a estimé qu'il devait y avoir un « bougé » dans les relations avec l'Algérie, et affirmé qu'une remise en cause de l'accord franco-algérien de 1968 n'était pas « à l'ordre du jour », indique une dépêche de l'AFP. Cela pourrait tra-duire la volonté du gouver-nement Lecornu de tourner la page de Bruno Retailleau qui avait alimenté les ten-sions avec l’Algérie pour gagner des soutiens dans les cercles proches de l’extrême droite dans la perspective des présidentielles de 2027. Paris semble vouloir changer son fusil d’épaule puisque les urgences aujourd’hui ne sont plus les futures présiden-tielles mais la gestion d’une économie en berne qui ne pourrait pas survivre sans la relance des échanges avec les pays du sud de la méditer-ranée notamment l’Algérie et les pays du Sahel. « Je comprends que la tension qu'il y a actuellement avec l'Algérie fait qu'on n'a plus de relation sécuritaire avec eux, d'échanges sécuri-taires. Pour un ministre de l'Intérieur, c'est un problème, c'est un gros problème», a déclaré Laurent Nunez. Ce qui laisse supposer que la France va s’atteler dans les prochains jours à tenter de désamorcer les bombes ins-tallées par Bruno Retailleau pour torpiller ses relations avec l’Algérie. Et comme signe d’une volonté de dégel initié par la France, la présen-ce d’officiels français, sur autorisation de l’Elysée, aux festivités marquant la jour-née du 17 octobre 1961. Ce discours du nouveau ministre de l’Intérieur, et les signaux timides émis par la France sont-ils un gage de bonne volonté adressés en direction de l’Algérie ? C’est encore tôt pour l’affirmer et il faudra attendre d’autres signes plus significatifs et des déclarations de bonne volon-té pour y croire. Mais pour nombre d’observateurs, le départ de Bruno Retailleau signifie que le gouvernement Lecornu est décidé à tourner la page Sansal, celle des OQTF ou encore celle de l’abrogation de l’accord de 1968 conclu entre l’Algérie et la France. Slimane B. FACE À L’ESSOR DE L’INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE L’UGTA met en garde contre la disparition des emplois L e secrétaire général de l’Union générale des travailleurs algériens (UGTA), Amar Takdjout, a averti que la transformation numérique et l’expansion de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en Algérie entraîneront la dispari-tion de nombreux emplois. Dans une déclaration à la presse, en marge de la conférence internationale sur le thème « Autonomisation des syndicats arabes face à l’impact de l’intelligence artificiel-le sur le marché du travail », organisée par la Confédération arabe des syndi-cats (ATUC) et l’UGTA, Takdjout a indi-qué que la centrale syndicale s’emploie-ra à identifier ces postes afin de préser-ver les acquis des travailleurs et d’éviter une hausse du chômage liée à ces muta-tions technologiques. Il a souligné la nécessité d’adopter une approche proactive pour faire face aux change-ments rapides du marché du travail induits par l’IA. Selon lui, la transforma-tion numérique est devenue une réalité incontournable, et les syndicats doivent évoluer d’un rôle purement défensif vers un rôle de partenaire du dévelop-pement. Le responsable syndical a pré-cisé que les nouvelles technologies modifieront profondément la nature de nombreux métiers. Il a ainsi plaidé pour l’intégration du volet social dans la stra-tégie nationale de transformation numérique, notamment à travers la mise en place de mécanismes de recon-version et de requalification pour les tra-vailleurs dont les emplois pourraient être affectés par l’automatisation. «La technologie doit être un levier de créa-tion d’emplois, et non un facteur de chômage », a-t-il insisté, ajoutant que les syndicats eux-mêmes doivent se numériser dans leur gestion et leur organisation interne pour accompagner équitablement les mutations du monde du travail.

Hommage à la beauté féminine, le ZAOULI s’inspire de deux masques : le Blou et le Djela. Son autre nom, « Djela lou Zaouli », signifie « Zaouli, la fille de Djela ». Le Zaouli associe, dans un même spectacle, la sculpture (le masque), le tissage (le costume), la musique (l’orchestre, la chanson) et la danse. Le masque Zaouli se décline en sept masques faciaux traduisant chacun une légende spécifique. Les détenteurs et les praticiens sont les sculpteurs, les artisans, les instrumentistes, les chanteurs, les danseurs et les notables (garants des coutumes et des traditions de la communauté). Dès lors, le ZAOULI possède une fonction éducative, ludique et esthétique. Porteur de l’identité culturelle de ses détenteurs, il contribue également à la préservation de l’environnement, et favorise l’intégration et la cohésion sociale. La transmission de l’élément s’opère à l’occasion des représentations musicales et des séances d’apprentissage. Les amateurs en apprennent la pratique sous la supervision de praticiens expérimentés. La viabilité du ZAOULI est assurée grâce aux représentations populaires, organisées deux à trois fois par semaine par les communautés. La chefferie traditionnelle, garante des traditions, joue également un rôle clé dans le processus de transmission. Les festivals et les concours de danse inter-villages constituent également d’autres opportunités de revitalisation. En définitive, le ZAOULI est réputé détenir des pouvoirs permettant l’accroissement de la productivité du milieu dans lequel il est pratiqué. Inscrit sur la liste prestigieuse du Patrimoine Mondial de l’UNESCO, le ZAOULI est une synthèse de la sculpture, la musique et le tissage.

Après une hausse de près de 2,9 millions de barils par jour depuis avril, **l’organisation prévoit une légère augmentation pour décembre 2025** avant une suspension durant le premier trimestre 2026. **Cette stratégie intervient dans un contexte de sanctions occidentales contre la Russie,** membre influent de l’Opep+. ## L’Opep+ modère sa production : une stratégie prudente face à un marché incertain Face à un marché pétrolier mondial incertain, **l’Opep+ a opté pour une approche prudente en ajustant légèrement à la hausse sa production** de pétrole en décembre 2025. 😱¡Aumenta el precio del barril de [#petróleo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/petr%C3%B3leo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!📈 tras el anuncio de que la [#OPEP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) pausará las subidas de producción a partir del primer trimestre de 2026 [pic.twitter.com/eqbBHVvZLF](https://t.co/eqbBHVvZLF) — XTB Latinoamérica (@XTBLatam) [November 3, 2025](https://twitter.com/XTBLatam/status/1985319647860662638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Cette décision intervient dans un contexte où le groupe craint un excédent d’offre sur le marché. **Depuis avril dernier, l’Opep+, qui regroupe les pays de l’Opep, la Russie et plusieurs autres producteurs,** avait augmenté ses objectifs de production de près de 2,9 millions de barils par jour. Cela représente environ 2,7% de la demande mondiale. Cependant, devant les signes d’une possible surabondance, **l’Opep+ a décidé de suspendre toute augmentation de production au premier trimestre 2026,** ralentissant ainsi le rythme des hausses initiées depuis octobre. OPEP+ suspend l’augmentation de la production de pétrole après décembre — CGTN Français (@CGTNFrancais) [November 2, 2025](https://twitter.com/CGTNFrancais/status/1985119500203655224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ## Sanctions occidentales contre la Russie : quel impact sur la stratégie de l’Opep+ ? **La stratégie de l’Opep+ est mise à l’épreuve par les sanctions occidentales imposées à la Russie** suite à l’invasion de l’Ukraine. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%20132%2079\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flag_of_OPEC.svg_-300x180.png) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%20132%2079\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flag_of_OPEC.svg_-300x180.png) Ces mesures, ciblant notamment Rosneft et Lukoil, **deux géants pétroliers russes, pourraient entraver la capacité de la Russie** à augmenter sa production. **L’Opep+ cherche à consolider sa position face à ses concurrents,** en particulier les producteurs américains. Cependant, **ces sanctions ajoutent une couche d’incertitude à un marché déjà instable,** obligeant le groupe à naviguer avec prudence dans ce contexte complexe. ## Pause hivernale dans la production de pétrole : une tradition respectée par l’Opep+ En décembre, huit pays membres de l’Opep+ (Arabie saoudite, Russie, Émirats arabes unis, Irak, Koweït, Oman, Kazakhstan et Algérie) ont décidé d’augmenter leurs objectifs de production de 137 000 barils par jour, comme ils l’avaient fait en octobre et novembre. 🛢️ L’OPEP+ relance la production ! ➡️ +137 000 barils/jour dès décembre 2025 🇩🇿 L’Algérie : +4000 barils/jour Objectif : soutenir un marché pétrolier stable 🌍[#OPEP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Algérie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Alg%C3%A9rie?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Énergie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%C3%89nergie?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#MarchéPétrolier](https://twitter.com/hashtag/March%C3%A9P%C3%A9trolier?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/POPi6LKwbw](https://t.co/POPi6LKwbw) — elwatan-dz.com (@elwatandzcom) [November 3, 2025](https://twitter.com/elwatandzcom/status/1985305071022747768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) **Cette augmentation s’inscrit dans une stratégie de réponse à la demande mondiale.** Cependant, ces pays ont choisi de suspendre les augmentations de production pour janvier, février et mars 2026. Cette pause hivernale est une tradition, car cette période correspond généralement à un ralentissement de la demande de pétrole. **L’Opep+ avait déjà adopté des décisions similaires lors des années précédentes.** ##### Partager cet article sur ![Mehdi Moussaïd](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%2080%2080\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E) ![Mehdi Moussaïd](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mehdi-Moussaid-scaled-80x80.jpg) ## Écrit par [Mehdi Moussaïd](https://www.maghrebemergent.com/auteur/mehdi/) Journaliste indépendant spécialisé dans l’économie, l’énergie et le développement industriel en Algérie.

Zigaretten auf dem Schwarzmarkt. Illegale Zigaretten kosteten den Staat im letzten Jahr allein 401 Millionen Euro. Ab 1. September starten der BDZ und Philip Morris Deutschland deshalb eine gemeinsame Aufklärungskampagne. von Sprit+ --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [Folgen auf:](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJqxqAwwgI_tAg?hl=de&gl=DE&ceid=DE:de) --- * [#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\") * [#Tabakkonsum](/tag/tabakkonsum-3368052 \"Tabakkonsum\") * [#Tabaksteuer](/tag/tabaksteuer-3692852 \"Tabaksteuer\") Nur 38 Prozent der Befragten lehnen den Kauf illegaler Waren – etwa geschmuggelter Zigaretten – konsequent ab. Gleichzeitig zeigt fast die Hälfte (48 Prozent) zumindest Verständnis für solche Käufe. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer repräsentativen Online-[Umfrage](/tag/umfrage-1712250 \"Mehr zum Thema Umfrage\") des Meinungsforschungsinstituts Bonsai Public im Auftrag von [Philip Morris](/tag/philip-morris-2020390 \"Mehr zum Thema Philip Morris\") Deutschland*1*. Kriminelle Strukturen scheinen bereits tief in der Gesellschaft verankert zu sein und zunehmend akzeptiert oder in Kauf genommen zu werden. Angesichts wachsender Steuerverluste, eines florierenden Schwarzmarkts und der Stärkung krimineller Netzwerke, die mit Menschenhandel, Drogen- und Waffenkriminalität verbunden sind, hält Philip Morris dies für ein besorgniserregendes Signal. Die Bedrohung durch die Organisierte Kriminalität wird von acht von zehn Befragten als hoch oder sehr hoch eingeschätzt – und das nicht ohne Grund: 59 Prozent erleben sie bereits als Teil ihres Alltags und ist davon überzeugt, dass sie auch in der eigenen Region stattfindet. Deutschland als Produktionsort für illegale Zigaretten – dem Haupttreiber und eine zentrale Finanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität – können sich immerhin über 40 Prozent vorstellen. Damit ist das Thema für viele keine abstrakte Bedrohung in fernen Ländern mehr. Fast die Hälfte der Befragten fordert daher, dass die Politik dem Kampf gegen Organisierte Kriminalität deutlich mehr Priorität einräumen muss. Gleichzeitig zeigt die Umfrage erhebliche Wissenslücken: Die Rolle illegaler Zigaretten als eine Hauptfinanzierungsquelle der Organisierten Kriminalität wird stark unterschätzt. ## Die Kampagne Genau hier will die neue bundesweite Aufklärungskampagne von Philip Morris Deutschland und der BDZ Deutsche Zoll- und Finanzgewerkschaft ansetzen. Ziel ist es, auf den illegalen Handel und dessen Verbindungen zur Organisierten Kriminalität aufmerksam zu machen. Die Kernbotschaft lautet: \"Der Handel mit illegalen Tabakwaren ist kein Kavaliersdelikt – er gefährdet die öffentliche [Sicherheit](/tag/sicherheit-1366953 \"Mehr zum Thema Sicherheit\"), verursacht erhebliche wirtschaftliche Schäden und stärkt kriminelle Netzwerke.\" Geplant sind Informationsmaßnahmen im öffentlichen Raum. Auch das Bild eines stetigen Stroms illegaler [Produkte](/tag/produkte-1654301 \"Mehr zum Thema Produkte\") wird aufgegriffen: Insgesamt werden 17 [Lkw](/tag/lkw-1359261 \"Mehr zum Thema Lkw\") mit bedruckten Heckflächen unterwegs sein, um Aufmerksamkeit auf das Thema zu lenken. Im Jahr 2024 wurden hierzulande schätzungsweise 1,7 Milliarden illegale Zigaretten konsumiert – ein Lkw steht damit symbolisch für 100 Millionen illegal konsumierte Zigaretten. ## Wirtschaft und Sicherheit werden untergraben Allein in Deutschland entgingen dem Staat im vergangenen Jahr rund 401 Millionen Euro an Steuereinnahmen allein durch den Konsum illegal hergestellter Zigaretten (Quelle: KPMG Report 2024). Gewinne aus dem illegalen Handel fließen häufig in andere kriminelle Aktivitäten. Damit untergräbt der illegale Zigarettenmarkt nicht nur wirtschaftliche Strukturen, sondern auch die öffentliche Sicherheit. \"Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage sprechen eine deutliche Sprache: Eine alarmierende Akzeptanz illegaler Produkte untergräbt unsere Gesellschaft und stärkt die Organisierte Kriminalität. Besonders der Handel mit illegalen Zigaretten spielt dabei eine große Rolle – er finanziert kriminelle Strukturen. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Organisierte Kriminalität keine Randerscheinung ist, sondern eine präsente Bedrohung für die öffentliche Sicherheit“, so Tammo Körner, Senior Manager Fiscal Affairs & ITP bei Philip Morris Deutschland. Nach Ansicht von Phlip Morris ist ein entschlossenes Vorgehen auf mehreren Ebenen notwendig: * Die Kriminalitätsbekämpfung muss gestärkt werden. * Eine verbesserte internationale Zusammenarbeit gegen die meist grenzüberschreitend operierenden Netzwerke. * Eine umfassenden Aufklärungsarbeit, um Bürgern für die Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Kauf illegaler Zigaretten und der Finanzierung krimineller Aktivitäten zu sensibilisieren. Thomas Liebel, Bundesvorsitzender der BDZ, ergänzt: \"Der Zoll ist der Schutzwall, der Staatseinnahmen sichert, die Wirtschaft vor kriminellen Einflüssen bewahrt und die Sicherheit der Bevölkerung gewährleistet. Doch trotz wachsender Aufgaben, etwa angesichts der Zunahme illegaler Produktionsstätten für Zigaretten und immer professioneller organisierter Geldwäsche, wird die Modernisierung des Zolls durch anhaltende Sparmaßnahmen gebremst – und das kommt die Allgemeinheit teuer zu stehen.\" *1Online-Umfrage im August 2025 unter 1.000 Personen in Deutschland im Alter von 18 bis 69 Jahren.* --- [Kommentare](#comments) [Teilen](#) [ZUR STARTSEITE](/ \"Zur Startseite\") --- ### HASHTAG --- ## *[#Tabak](/tag/tabak-1638846 \"Tabak\")* 22.08.2025 [#Intertabac](/tag/intertabac-1986923 \"Intertabac\") ## [Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025](/nachrichten/tabak-und-tabakersatz/nicht-verpassen-landewyck-auf-der-intertabac-2025-3701358 \"Nicht verpassen: Landewyck auf der Intertabac 2025\") [Bei Landewyck bildet wie schon im Vorjahr die Mademoiselle den Hauptblickfang des Messestands auf der Intertabac.

Dahinter verbarg sich einer der meistgesuchten Drogenbosse Europas. Nun stand eine der Frauen in Zürich vor Gericht. ![René Laglstorfer](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/3tw5IWneaKo8BIJbXh_YFL.jpg) ![Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/BLeGt9CK4FP9PcnTeZSeEt.jpg \"Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht\") Der Albtraum begann in den Ferien mit einem Anruf ihrer Enkelin im Juli 2022. «Fedpol und Kantonspolizei durchsuchen gerade dein Haus», sagte die junge Frau zu ihrer Grossmutter. «Ich bin komplett durch den Wind gewesen und habe gedacht: Spinnen die?», schildert die 63-Jährige. Die Frau ist langjährige Beizerin am Bodensee. 2013 hatte sie eine Firma gegründet, um in einer thurgauischen Seegemeinde ein Hotel zu bauen. Doch Investoren blieben aus, im November 2020 wollte die Beizerin die Firma wieder loswerden. «Ich habe meiner Treuhänderin Aida P. (Name geändert) eine Vollmacht gegeben, die Firma zu verkaufen, aber ich wusste nicht, an wen», sagt die Wirtin dieser Redaktion. Zurück aus den Ferien wurde die Frau zwei Stunden lang einvernommen. Polizisten hätten viele Fragen gestellt und ihr zig Blätter mit Namen darauf gezeigt, von denen sie niemanden gekannt habe. «Ich finde es verrückt, wie leicht man in so was hineingeraten kann», sagt die Beizerin. ## Dolder, Baur au Lac und Rüschlikon Rund fünf Monate vor dem scheinbar unbedeutenden Firmenverkauf waren der damals 33-jährige «Artur Gitta» und die 26-jährige «Simone Jung» als Touristen in die Schweiz eingereist. Für mehr als 75’000 Franken und mit gefälschten Reisepässen checkte das deutsche Paar im Juni 2020 für einen Monat im Zürcher Luxushotel Dolder ein. Es folgten zwei Wochen im Baur au Lac für rund 22’000 Franken, bis das offenbar wohlhabende Paar in einer Villa am See in Rüschlikon für monatlich 18’000 Franken eine feste Bleibe fand. ![Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/7U7oS4JR4Dc9sHOL49V5wV.jpg \"Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23\") Damit endete die jahrelange Flucht rund um den Globus von einem der meistgesuchten Kriminellen Europas: Denn hinter dem Namen «Artur Gitta» verbirgt sich der belgische Kokainkönig Flor Bressers, dessen Drogenkartell tonnenweise Rauschgift nach Europa geschmuggelt haben soll. «Simone Jung» wiederum ist die gefälschte Identität seiner holländischen Lebensgefährtin [Philomina Veenstra](/freundin-von-kokainkoenig-sass-monatelang-mit-baby-in-zuercher-gefaengnis-134865075326) (Name geändert). ## Familiengründung in der Schweiz 20 Monate lang, bis zu seiner [spektakulären Verhaftung](/belgischer-topverbrecher-von-zuercher-spezialeinheit-verhaftet-276783770429) im Februar 2022 in einer Luxuswohnung im Zürcher Renaissance-Tower, sollte Flor Bressers einen sicheren Hafen in der Schweiz haben. Von hier aus konnte der Kokainkönig unbehelligt sein internationales Drogenkartell lenken. So sicher muss er sich gefühlt haben, dass er in dieser Zeit mit seiner Freundin eine Familie gründete – ein Sohn kam in der Schweiz zur Welt. Das Paar führte ein Leben in Saus und Braus mit [Ausgaben in Millionenhöhe,](/das-unglaubliche-luxusleben-des-belgischen-kokainkoenigs-am-zuerichsee-184889075678) wie diese Redaktion zuerst berichtete. ## Flor Bressers findet einen Job Möglich gemacht haben das Luxusleben, finanziert aus dem internationalen Drogenhandel, am Zürichsee zahlreiche Helfer. Doch nicht alle dürften gewusst haben, wer sich hinter «Gitta» wirklich verbarg, wie Recherchen zeigen. ![Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/2gwpU9f1qKaA7utZtF82KO.jpg \"Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.\") Eine dieser Helferinnen ist die eingangs erwähnte Treuhänderin Aida P., die sich am Donnerstag wegen schwerer Geldwäscherei, Begünstigung und Täuschung der Behörden vor dem Bezirksgericht Zürich verantworten muss. Die Thurgauerin konnte den sichtlich wohlhabenden «Artur Gitta» spätestens Ende August 2020 – wenige Monate nach dessen Ankunft in der Schweiz – zu ihrem Kundenkreis zählen. ## «Anschein eines rechtschaffenen Bürgers» Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Aida P. vor, nicht nur einen Wohnsitz für «Gitta» und dessen Familie an der Zürcher Goldküste für einen maximalen Mietbetrag von monatlich 25’000 Franken gesucht zu haben. Die 36-Jährige soll ihm bereits Ende August zum Schein einen Arbeitsvertrag als Mitarbeiter in ihrem Treuhandbüro ausgestellt haben. «Die Idee war, unseren Kundenstamm über sein Netzwerk zu erweitern. Er wollte Neukunden bringen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. Als Wohnort gab sie dessen Adresse in einem Wohnblock im thurgauischen Amriswil an, wo er jedoch laut den Ermittlern nie gewohnt hat. ![Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/EdaEx7mbKe29b_TumnzYuR.jpg \"Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.\") Gestützt auf diese Angaben, stellte das Migrationsamt Thurgau dem angeblichen Artur Gitta eine B-Aufenthaltsbewilligung aus. «Mit ihrem Verhalten und ihren Tätigkeiten erweckte die Beschuldigte den Anschein, dass es sich bei Artur Gitta (Flor Bressers) um einen rechtschaffenen Bürger handelte», heisst es in der Anklageschrift. Auch soll Aida P. «Gitta» dabei unterstützt haben, dass er bei Behörden nie selber oder mit seinen echten Personalien auftreten musste. Damit habe sie ihm «wissentlich oder willentlich geholfen», seine wahre Identität zu verschleiern und ihn dem Zugriff der Strafverfolgungsbehörden zu entziehen. ## Der Finanzchef und der Concierge Als schwerster Vorwurf wiegt jedoch, dass die 36-jährige Treuhänderin Gelder aus dem Kokainhandel gewaschen haben soll, indem sie diese entgegennahm und in der Schweiz investierte. Der direkte Gewinn für die Treuhänderin betrug dabei laut Anklageschrift 51’000 Franken, wobei aus einem Bauprojekt am Bodensee weitere 100’000 Franken erwartet wurden. Ab September 2020 erhielten Aida P. und ihre 34-jährige Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. (Name geändert) über Geldkuriere nachweislich insgesamt 320’000 Franken Bargeld von drei Männern: «Gitta», dessen damals ebenso im Kanton Zürich lebenden Finanzchef Bastiaan K. und einem ergebenen [privaten Concierge](/concierge-ermoeglichte-luxusleben-wie-sich-der-kokainkoenig-in-zuerich-versteckte-847540903985). ## Wusste die Treuhänderin, wer Artur Gitta wirklich ist? 190’000 Franken davon seien in zwei Tranchen jeweils in einer Schuhschachtel in Aida P.s Treuhandbüro am Bodensee übergeben worden. Das Geld war vorgesehen, um die unverdächtige Firma der eingangs erwähnten Beizerin zu kaufen. Die Kauf- und Vertragsverhandlungen dafür führte Aida P. laut Staatsanwaltschaft im Namen von «Gitta». 190’000 Franken Bargeld gingen an die Beizerin. Vor Gericht sagt die Treuhänderin: «Wir haben seinen Ausweis überprüft, aber nicht sein Geld.» Auch für zwei Banken sei Artur Gitta «sauber» gewesen. Nach der Übernahme wurde die Firma in «Gitta Suisse AG» umbenannt und residierte an der derselben Adresse am Bodensee wie das Treuhandbüro. Dies sollte Flor Bressers den Anschein eines gewöhnlichen Unternehmers verleihen mit offiziellem Wohn- und Arbeitsort im ländlichen Thurgau. ![Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. ](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/9qlyQJe14XOAq3ua2_2vsd.jpg \"Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. \") Mit Geld vom Konto seiner unscheinbaren Firma kaufte die Treuhänderin im Februar 2021 zehn Kilo Silberbarren im Schätzwert von 6800 Franken und verwahrte sie im Bankschliessfach ihres Büros. ## Die verzweigten Geldflüsse der Treuhänderinnen Die verbleibenden etwa 130’000 Franken Bargeld zahlten Aida P. und ihre Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. in vier- bis fünfstelligen Beträgen zunächst auf ihre Privatkonten ein. Von dort überwiesen die beiden Frauen das Geld laut Anklageschrift unter Angabe falscher Gründe, etwa «Rückzahlung Kleinkredit», auf das Firmenkonto ihres Treuhandbüros. Von diesem und einem weiteren Firmenkonto der Gitta Suisse AG überwies Aida P. zwischen September 2020 und November 2021 elf «fingierte Gehaltszahlungen» an Artur Gitta über jeweils 4500 Franken – insgesamt rund 50’000 Franken. Doch laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat «Gitta» nie für das Treuhandbüro am Bodensee gearbeitet. «Man hätte es vermuten können, wer er in Wahrheit ist, aber ich habe es nicht vermutet. Ich bin zu wenig vorsichtig gewesen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. ## Falsche Angaben bei Behörden Im Juni und Juli 2021 soll die beschuldigte Treuhänderin bei den Steuer- und Einwohnerbehörden der Stadt Amriswil unwahre Angaben über den tatsächlichen Wohnort des Kokainkönigs gemacht haben. Zur selben Zeit überwies Aida P. 70’000 Franken auf ihr Privatkonto, um damit bei einem Luxusgeschäft im Zürcher Kreis 4 eine exklusive Stereoanlage für «Gitta» zu kaufen. Dieser gab mit seiner Lebensgefährtin im selben Laden weitere 64’000 Franken aus. Für Schmuck waren es 667’000 Franken und für Wein 400’000 Franken – über 2,5 Millionen Franken in etwa 20 Monaten. ## Finanzchef wird am Basler Flughafen verhaftet Im Oktober 2021 musste «Gitta» einen schweren Rückschlag verdauen: Sein engster Vertrauter, der erwähnte Finanzchef Bastiaan K., wurde am Flughafen Basel-Mulhouse verhaftet und später nach Belgien ausgeliefert. Dasselbe Schicksal ereilte den als Flor Bressers enttarnten «Gitta» vier Monate später. Beide mutmasslichen Schwerkriminellen warten seither mit 33 weiteren Beschuldigten auf ihren Prozess in Belgien, wie diese Redaktion aus Justizkreisen erfahren hat. Bei einer Verurteilung drohen beiden lange Gefängnisstrafen. ## «Die Alarmglocken müssen schrillen» Weit glimpflicher kommen die beiden Treuhänderinnen dank Geständnissen und eines Deals mit der Staatsanwaltschaft davon. Giulia S. erhielt einen rechtskräftigen Strafbefehl mit einer bedingten Geldstrafe von 180 Tagessätzen à 90 Franken und einer Geldbusse von 3900 Franken. Zudem muss sie 80’000 Franken als Ersatzforderung an den Staat zahlen. ![Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/6dudW4BXquo9FvO50rGpti.jpg \"Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)\") Am Ende erkennt Aida P. sämtliche Vorwürfe an. Die Richter verurteilten sie zu einer bedingten Freiheitsstrafe von zwölf Monaten sowie zu eine bedingten Geldstrafe von 90 Tagessätzen à 110 Franken – insgesamt 9900 Franken.

Aida P. allegedly helped Bressers conceal his true identity by providing a false identity (\"Artur Gitta\"), securing a Swiss residence permit under false pretenses, and issuing a sham employment contract to create the appearance of a legitimate citizen. She is accused of knowingly facilitating money laundering by receiving and investing drug proceeds in Switzerland, including handling at least CHF 320,000 in cash delivered by money couriers connected to Bressers and his associates. Part of these funds (CHF 190,000) were used to purchase a local company under Bressers’ control, with Aida P. conducting negotiations on his behalf. The treuhänderin reportedly profited directly by CHF 51,000, with further gains expected. The case highlights failures in KYC and suspicious transaction monitoring, as banks reportedly considered \"Artur Gitta\" a clean client despite the underlying criminal activity. The investigation is ongoing, with court proceedings underway in Zurich. No regulatory fines or enforcement actions against Lukoil or its affiliates are mentioned.

August in Alaska statt. Ziel sei, einem Ende der Kämpfe näher zu kommen, so Trump. Der ukrainische Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj zeigte sich offen für eine Teilnahme an dem Gespräch, wurde jedoch auf Wunsch Russlands nicht eingeladen. Er bezeichnete das geplante Treffen als „Täuschungsversuch“ von Putin und stellte klar, die Ukraine werde auf keine Gebiete verzichten. Die EU-Außenminister haben für diesen Montag kurzfristig eine Videokonferenz anberaumt, um ihre Position abzustimmen. Vorab hatten mehrere europäische Staaten erklärt, dass keine Entscheidung ohne Beteiligung der Ukraine getroffen werden dürfe (Tagesschau).

Das bekräftigte Vizepräsident JD Vance in einem am Sonntag veröffentlichten Interview mit dem TV-Sender Fox News. Vance vertrat die Auffassung, dass die Ukraine weiterhin US-Waffen für ihren Verteidigungskampf beziehen könnten – diese müssten dann aber von den Europäern bezahlt werden (n-tv).

Das erklärte Kostjantyn Milewski, Leiter der Koordinierung des Militärdiensts von Ausländern in den Streitkräften der Ukraine, in einem Interview. Über alle Teilstreitkräfte hinweg könnten es sogar mehr als doppelt so viele sein. Darunter seien auch rund 500 Deutsche. Die mit Abstand größte Gruppe der Ausländer komme jedoch aus Kolumbien. Nach ukrainischen Angaben wächst das russische Truppenkontingent trotz massiver Verluste weiter an. Für die Ukraine wird es zunehmend schwierig, die eigenen Truppen zu verstärken (T-Online). **7.

Keiner der Parteien gelinge es, entscheidende Geländegewinne zu erzielen. Der Krieg habe sich in eine zermürbende Abnutzungsschlacht verwandelt, mit allen Risiken für militärische Stabilität, wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit und politische Resilienz auf beiden Seiten (Berliner Zeitung).

Dies geschehe um sich für den Fall zu wappnen, dass die „törichten und aufrührerischen Äußerungen” des russischen Ex-Präsidenten Dmitri Medwedew mehr als nur dies seien. Nachdem Trump vergangene Woche das Ultimatum an Putin auf zehn Tage verkürzt und heftige Sanktionen in den Raum gestellt hatte, drohte Medwedew mit einer nuklearen Auseinandersetzung zwischen Russland und den USA. Wenn Medwedew über Atomwaffen rede, müsse Amerika vorbereitet sein, so nun Trumps Reaktion, die in den USA auf ein geteiltes Echo stieß (Tagesschau). **1. August 2025** ### Aktuelle Lage [**Tote und viele Verletzte nach Angriffen auf Kiew**](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/angriffe-kiew-russland-100.html \"Tagesschau [Link öffnet sich in neuem Tab]\") Erneut hat die russische Armee die Hauptstadt Kiew und Umgebung attackiert.

Gleitbomben dieser Art werden von russischen Kampfjets über russisch kontrolliertem Gebiet nahe der Front abgeworfen und schlagen dann auf ukrainischer Seite ein. Für die ukrainische Flugabwehr sind die Jets außer Reichweite, und aufgrund der kurzen Flugzeit der Bomben gibt es so gut wie keine Vorwarnzeit für die Bevölkerung (Tagesschau). [**Ostukraine - Steht Pokrowsk vor russischer Besatzung?**](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europa/pokrowsk-ukraine-russland-100.html \"Tagesschau [Link öffnet sich in neuem Tab]\") Russland ist es in den vergangenen Monaten gelungen, in der ostukrainischen Region Donbass Dorf um Dorf immer weiter vorzurücken. Auch die Stadt und die Region Pokrowsk im Gebiet Donezk stehen seit Anfang des Jahres unter Dauerbeschuss. Die Behörden rufen eindringlich zur Evakuierung auf, es könnte nur noch knapp zwei Wochen dauern, bis die russische Armee auch bis hierher vorgerückt ist, so die Warnung. Es wäre harter Schlag für die Ukraine, sollte Pokrowsk unter russische Besatzung geraten, der Ort gilt als wichtiger logistischer Knotenpunkt in der Region Donezk (Tagesschau). ### Weitere Beiträge [**Trump droht Russland mit weiteren Sanktionen**](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/krieg-in-der-ukraine-donald-trump-droht-russland-mit-weiteren-sanktionen-a-be9727c9-24ed-4886-8603-284fa18632ed \"Spiegel [Link öffnet sich in neuem Tab]\") Russlands Vorgehen in der Ukraine sei »widerwärtig«: Donald Trump hat seine Sanktionsdrohungen gegen den Kreml abermals verschärft.

Die Zehn-Tage-Frist beginne “ab heute”, so Trump. Sollte es keine Einigung auf eine Waffenruhe oder eine Friedensvereinbarung innerhalb der Frist gebe, droht Trump mit deutlich höheren Zöllen für Russlands Handelspartner. Damit soll die wirtschaftliche Basis des Kremls weiter geschwächt werden, indem vor allem große Abnehmer wie China und Indien stärker unter Druck gesetzt werden. Welche Länder es konkret treffen könnte, hat Trump bislang nicht ausgeführt (Welt).

Foto: Alex Brandon/AP/dpa Krypto-ABC: Die wichtigsten Begriffe verständlich erklärt ### Problematischer Schulterschluss? Der Scherz verdeutlicht, wie stark sich das politische Klima für die Branche unter Trump gewandelt hat. Sein demokratischer Amtsvorgänger Joe Biden setzte auf eine restriktive Regulierung von Digitalwährungen und warnte vor Geldwäsche sowie potenziellen Risiken für die Finanzmärkte. Trump hingegen zeigte sich bereits im Wahlkampf aufgeschlossen gegenüber Digitalwährungen – und erhielt beträchtliche Unterstützung aus der Branche. Nach seinem Wahlsieg war unter anderem der [Bitcoin-Kurs](/boerse/isin/G1007) stark gestiegen. Kritiker sehen allerdings einen potenziell problematischen Schulterschluss zwischen dem Präsidentenamt und den wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Trump-Familie. So ließ der Republikaner kurz vor seinem Amtsantritt einen sogenannten „Meme Coin“ mit seinem Konterfei namens „$TRUMP“ auflegen – eine digitale Gedenkmünze, die gehandelt werden kann.

Sacks zufolge dürfen Handels- und Finanzministerium künftig weitere Bitcoin für die Reserve erwerben – allerdings ohne finanzielle Belastung für die Steuerzahler. Weiterhin sollen auch andere Währungen wie [Ethereum](/boerse/isin/G1008) und Solana in einem separaten Bestand verwahrt werden. Die Regierung werde jedoch keine aktiven Maßnahmen ergreifen, um diese Bestände systematisch auszubauen. Durch staatliche Maßnahmen gegen kriminelle Netzwerke verfügt die US-Regierung bereits über Zehntausende Bitcoin. Sacks bezifferte den aktuellen Bestand auf rund 200.000 Einheiten.

Der Grund: Dessen Pistolen könnten von Kriminellen leicht zu vollautomatischen Waffen umgebaut werden – mit verheerenden Folgen. Von [Stefan Melichar](https://www.profil.at/author/stefan.melichar) 02.03.25 Drucken Schriftgröße „Sie sollten jetzt sofort damit aufhören!“ Das ist es, was Brandon Scott, Bürgermeister der US-Metropole Baltimore, der Führungsriege des österreichischen Waffenproduzenten Glock ausrichtet. profil hat diese Woche mit dem Stadt-Chef gesprochen. Womit das Unternehmen aus Sicht von Scott aufhören soll, ist schnell erklärt: mit dem Verkauf von Pistolenmodellen, die – so der Vorwurf – von Kriminellen besonders leicht zu verbotenen vollautomatischen Waffen umgebaut werden können. Der Bürgermeister und der Stadtrat von Baltimore haben deshalb Mitte Februar eine Klage gegen Glock eingebracht – und zwar gemeinsam mit dem Bundesstaat Maryland, in dem die 550.000-Einwohner-Stadt liegt. Es ist nicht die erste Klage dieser Art in den Vereinigten Staaten: Den Anfang machte vor knapp einem Jahr Chicago, [profil berichtete ausführlich](https://www.profil.at/wirtschaft/glock-muss-aufhoeren-profit-ueber-oeffentliche-sicherheit-zu-stellen/402844672). Ende 2024 setzten dann auch der Bundesstaat Minnesota und der Generalstaatsanwalt von New Jersey rechtliche Schritte. Chicago hatte ursprünglich nur die Firma Glock, Inc. in den USA geklagt. Eine später neu eingebrachte Version der Klage richtet sich – wie alle anderen mittlerweile vorliegenden Klagen – nun jedoch auch gegen die Glock Ges.m.b.H. mit Sitz in Deutsch-Wagram in Niederösterreich. „Es ist sehr klar, dass Glock wissentlich Feuerwaffen hergestellt und verkauft hat, die auf einzigartige Weise leicht umzubauen sind“, sagt Baltimores Bürgermeister Scott zu profil. Das heize die Waffengewalt in der Stadt an. 2023 seien in Baltimore rund 35 modifizierte Glock-Pistolen sichergestellt worden, heißt es in der Klage. 2024 seien es schon zumindest 65 gewesen – also fast doppelt so viele. Waffengewalt sei „eine Krankheit“, meint Scott. Die stark von Kriminalität geprägte 2,7-Millionen-Einwohner-Metropole Chicago verweist in ihrer Klagsschrift sogar auf 1300 modifizierte Glocks, die dort von 2021 bis Mai 2024 durch die Polizei aufgefunden worden seien. ## Umschalten und abdrücken Stein des Anstoßes ist ein kleiner Bauteil – eine Art Schalter (auf Englisch: „switch“) –, der hinten an der Pistole angesetzt werden kann und den Auslösemechanismus beeinflusst. Die Waffe feuert dann, solange der Abzug gedrückt bleibt und Patronen im Magazin sind. Eine legale halbautomatische Faustfeuerwaffe wird dadurch zur Maschinenpistole. Und vollautomatische Waffen sind sogar im Schießpulver-Paradies USA für Zivilisten verboten – wegen ihrer verheerenden Wirkung. 8. April 2023: In einer öffentlichen Wohnanlage in Newark im Bundesstaat New Jersey feuert ein Schütze 28 Mal mit einer Neun-Millimeter-Glock-Pistole. Dafür braucht er nur etwas mehr als eine Sekunde, drei Menschen werden schwer verletzt, wie es in der Klage von Generalstaatsanwalt Matthew Platkin heißt. Dies sei möglich gewesen, weil die Waffe mit einem „Switch“ zu einer Maschinenpistole gemacht worden sei, hält Platkin fest. Derartige „Switches“ könnten für weniger als 20 US-Dollar gekauft und in nicht einmal fünf Minuten installiert werden. Glock-Pistolen, die auf diese Weise modifiziert sind, könnten eine Feuergeschwindigkeit von 1200 Schuss pro Minute erreichen. Der Rückstoß sei so schwer zu kontrollieren, dass sich die Kugeln üblicherweise unkontrolliert über ein größeres Gebiet verteilen. ## „Glock hat die Angelegenheit einfach ignoriert“ Glock stellt die „Switches“ nicht selbst her. Viele davon kommen laut Klage aus China oder aus dem 3D-Drucker. Auch sind Glock-Pistolen nicht die einzigen Faustfeuerwaffen, die modifiziert werden können. Der Vorwurf, der in den USA nun laut wird, ist jedoch, dass dies bei gängigen Glock-Modellen besonders einfach möglich wäre. Dieser Umstand sei Glock auch bewusst. Dennoch weigere sich das Unternehmen, das Design der Waffen so anzupassen, dass die Modifikation entscheidend erschwert wird – obwohl dies zumutbar wäre. „Glock hat die Angelegenheit einfach ignoriert und zugelassen, dass das so weitergeht“, meint Baltimores Bürgermeister Scott im profil-Gespräch. New Jerseys Generalstaatsanwalt Platkin wiederum warf den österreichischen Glock-Eigentümern in einer Aussendung im Dezember vor, ihre Taschen mit Gewinnen zu füllen, welche durch Blutvergießen in Amerika bezahlt würden. Ein Blutvergießen, das durch Glock-Produkte genährt werde. Platkin wirft dem Unternehmen vor, Gier vor die Sicherheit von Einwohnern und Polizisten zu stellen. Diese Zeiten seien jedoch vorüber. ## Glock beantragte Abweisung Was sagt Glock dazu? Auf profil-Anfrage gar nichts: Glock kommentiere laufende Gerichtsverfahren nicht, heißt es von der Pressestelle des Unternehmens. Doch das bereits am längsten laufende US-Verfahren – jenes, das von der Stadt Chicago angestoßen wurde – lässt auf Basis dort eingebrachter Schriftsätze zumindest eine erste Einschätzung zu, was die Argumentationslinie des Waffenherstellers betrifft. Die österreichische Glock Ges. m.b.H. beantragte demnach im Oktober 2024 die Abweisung der Klage mit der Behauptung, diese sei nicht korrekt zugestellt worden – und außerdem falle die österreichische Firma nicht unter die Gerichtsbarkeit des US-Bundesstaats Illinois, in dem Chicago liegt. Auch der US-Ableger von Glock, die Glock Inc. in Georgia, stellte den Antrag, die Klage abzuweisen. Vereinfacht zusammengefasst argumentiert das Unternehmen: Wenn kriminelle Dritte legale Produkte missbrauchen würden, könne Glock nicht dafür zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. Die gesetzliche Grundlage, auf die sich Chicago beziehe, sei verfassungswidrig – unter anderem sei sie zu vage. ## Weitere Klagen möglich Eric Tirschwell ist Executive Director von „Everytown Law“, einer Organisation, die sich gegen Schusswaffengewalt einsetzt. Der Rechtsexperte hat sowohl an der Klage der Stadt Chicago als auch an jener von Baltimore und Maryland mitgearbeitet. Im profil-Interview will Tirschwell die Argumente von Glock nicht gelten lassen: Der Bundesstaat Illinois habe kürzlich ein Gesetz verabschiedet, das Waffenhersteller verpflichte, nicht durch unangemessenes Verhalten („unreasonable conduct“) zu einer Schädigung der Öffentlichkeit beizutragen. „Wir erheben den Vorwurf, dass der Verkauf von Waffen, welche derart leicht modifiziert werden können, unangemessenes Verhalten ist“, hält Tirschwell fest. Entscheidungen zu Design, Marketing und Verkauf in den USA würden zumindest teilweise in Österreich gefällt. Außerdem würden Pistolenteile und auch ganze Pistolen aus Österreich in die USA kommen. Das sei ausreichend für eine Gerichtszuständigkeit in den Vereinigten Staaten, meint Tirschwell. Für März ist eine mündliche Verhandlung im Chicago-Verfahren anberaumt. Dann werde das Gericht entscheiden, ob der Fall fortgesetzt werden kann, erklärt Tirschwell. Wenn ja, müsse Glock relevante Dokumente herausgeben, und Mitarbeiter sowie Manager des Unternehmens könnten unter Eid befragt werden. Sollte das Gericht die Klage abweisen, werde es wahrscheinlich ein Rechtsmittel dagegen geben. „Sofern Glock den Verkauf leicht modifizierbarer Waffen nicht stoppt, denke ich nicht, dass die jüngste Klage (Anm.: jene von Baltimore und Maryland) die letzte sein wird“, sagt Tirschwell. Glock dürfte also noch länger nicht aus der Schusslinie sein. Newsletter Drucken (profil.at) | Stand: ### Stefan Melichar [StefanMelichar](https://x.com/StefanMelichar) ist Chefreporter bei profil.

These modifications have been linked to increased gun violence, with authorities citing hundreds of such modified Glock pistols recovered between 2021 and 2024. The lawsuits accuse Glock of ignoring the issue and prioritizing profits over public safety. Glock has responded by seeking dismissal of the Chicago lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds and arguing that misuse by third parties should not hold the company liable. A court hearing is scheduled for March 2025 to decide whether the case proceeds, with potential discovery and depositions if allowed.

Schlegel](https://www.crowell.com/en/professionals/andrew-schlegel#overview) on Posted in [Russia Sanctions](https://www.cmtradelaw.com/category/russia-sanctions/) On October 15, 2025, the UK announced a significant expansion of its Russia-related sanctions regime, designating Lukoil and Rosneft—Russia’s two largest oil companies—as asset freeze targets. This is the first time Lukoil and Rosneft have been subjected to full asset freezing sanctions by any of the UK, U.S., or EU, and follows earlier UK measures against Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January 2025, Russia’s third and fourth largest oil companies. By targeting the parent companies, the UK sanctions will also extend to any companies that Lukoil or Rosneft majority own or otherwise control. The new [package](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025/list-of-russia-sanctions-targets-15-october-2025) also notably sanctions: * Nayara Energy Limited (an Indian refinery, 49% owned by Rosneft). This follows the EU’s sanctions on Nayara in July. In contrast to the EU’s action against Nayara, the UK issued a wind-down license for Nayara and the Chinese energy companies mentioned below), which expires on November 13, 2025; * an UAE commodity trading house (Wissol Commodities), several Chinese oil refineries and the Beihai LNG terminal (which had been importing LNG from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project); * an additional five Russian banks; and * companies that have been supplying electronics critical for Russian drones and missiles, including companies based in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey and China. The UK has continued its focus on vessels by specifying an additional 51 ships, including 44 identified as part of the “shadow fleet” used to transport Russian oil. These vessels are now prohibited from accessing UK ports and have any UK registration revoked. In parallel, the UK [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences) a wind-down licence for transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil and their subsidiaries (which expires on November 28, 2025) and amended two existing licences to allow transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft to continue in relation to 6 specified oil projects and to allow petrol station payments in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The UK has also [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-blow-for-putins-war-machine-as-uk-sanctions-russian-oil) that it will introduce a ban on the import of oil products refined in third countries from Russian-origin crude, aiming to address indirect flows of Russian oil into global markets. This will require amending regulations to be passed and follows the EU’s similar announced prohibition which comes into effect on 21 January 2026. Overall, these developments represent a notable escalation in UK sanctions on Russia and its oil revenues, especially by sanctioning Lukoil and Rosneft, energy companies that remain integrated into global markets and with operations and activity today in countries allied with the UK. It remains to be seen whether the EU will follow suit and target Lukoil and Rosneft as part of its 19th sanctions package, which is due imminently and similarly expected to focus on placing continuing pressure on Russian energy.

Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy.The United States will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith. Treasury will continue to use its authorities in support of a peace process. “Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” **said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.** “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Today’s action targets Russia’s two largest oil companies,**Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company**(Rosneft) and **Public Joint-Stock Company Oil Company Lukoil**(Lukoil), which are now designated. Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally. Rosneft and Lukoil are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Additionally, OFAC is designating a number of Russia-based Rosneft and Lukoil subsidiaries, a list of which is available in Annex 1 below. All entities owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Rosneft and Lukoil are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, even if not designated by OFAC. ### ANNEX 1: ROSNEFT AND LUKOIL SUBSIDIARIES The following Russia-based Lukoil and Rosneft subsidiaries are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy: * Lukoil subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Lukoil Perm** is involved in geological exploration and oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Aik A Limited Liability Company**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil Kaliningradmorneft**is developing onshore and offshore oil and gas fields in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Lukoil West Siberia Limited**is involved in oil and gas production in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Russian Innovation Fuel and Energy Company**is involved in the development, production, testing, and implementation of new technologies, techniques, and equipment for the development of hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves and enhanced oil recovery in Russia. * Lukoil subsidiary **Uraloil**is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Kuibyshevskii Neftepererabatyvayushchii Zavod** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **AO Sibneftegaz** is developing gas and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Bashneft Dobycha** is developing almost 200 hydrocarbon fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **CJSC Vankorneft** is developing a large oil and gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company East Siberian Oil and Gas Company**is developing an oil and gas condensate field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Grozneftegaz** produces oil and gas in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Rospan International**is developing oil and gas deposits in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Ryazan Oil Refinery Company** operates an oil refinery in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Joint Stock Company Samaraneftegaz** produces oil in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Kharampurneftegaz** is developing a gas field in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Bashneft Polus**explores, produces, and refines oil and oil products in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company Kynsko Chaselskoe Neftegaz**manages oil and gas condensate fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary **Limited Liability Company RN Purneftegaz** is developing oil and gas fields in Russia. * Rosneft subsidiary', summary='Date: 2023-03-08 | Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290) | Legal Status: Ongoing sanctions enforcement | Lukoil is listed among major Russian oil companies sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under OFAC authorities as part of measures related to the conflict in Ukraine.

With an eye on future trends, this week we lead by exploring Web3, the catch-all term for the vision of a new internet which at its core uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. For some it represents a transition from big corporations controlling and monetising content on the internet to individuals sharing content and interacting through decentralised networks. But for others, the notion of a decentralised internet presents many challenges, especially how to identify, prosecute, and prevent financial crime on the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets are inextricably linked to the concept of Web3, so we also deliver the latest news surrounding the world of virtual currencies and renewed efforts by authorities to detect and prevent crime in the sector. In addition, we feature updates on global sanctions, cover the growing focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards, present you with the most recent reports, legislation & guides, and finally wrap up this week’s Roundup by reviewing the latest news from the world of money laundering. ### **What exactly is Web3?** Web3 isn’t yet fully in existence, so nobody knows exactly how it will work. But most concepts involve the blockchain, an unchangeable ledger system used by cryptocurrencies to keep track of transactions. Some believe that [Web3](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/web3-definition-internet.html) is little more than a rebranding exercise for crypto, others believe it’s a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet, in which every activity and social interaction can be bought and sold. ### **Can a blockchain-based decentralised internet change the world?** The appeal of the blockchain for Web3 supporters is that it logs everything in a way that is transparent and impossible to edit or falsify; each new transaction creates a “block” in the ledger anyone can see. The main issue of the blockchain is the same as its supposed benefit, as nobody can edit the ledger, and anyone can create as many crypto accounts as they want, it’s hard to [address and protect against fraud](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-web3-5271876). ### **Webinar: Experts Take on FinCrime: Web3 and Digital Assets** While Web3 and digital assets have the potential to benefit society, cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols are a central tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. At this upcoming [webinar](https://www.napier.ai/post/web3-financial-risk-compliance) (Wednesday, September 21st, 2022 @ 9:30 am BST) experts from law enforcement and technology vendors will discuss the digital asset ecosystem as it relates to financial crime. ### **Helium: an example of Web3 in action today** [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is a crowdsourced wireless network that rewards users with cryptocurrency for sharing their home network connections. This effectively creates a large network of hotspots that users can access, while the owners of those hotspots can receive compensation in the form of crypto tokens. ### **Crawley Town Football club: The “transformative sports success story of Web 3.0”** While traditional finance was used in the initial purchase of Crawley Town football club, its owners are now harnessing [digital currencies to build a remote community of fans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62136553). In July, Crawley launched their own NFT and for the price of 0.35 Ether (worth £353 at the time of publication) buyers received ‘a virtual season ticket’. ## Money Laundering, Fraud & Corruption ### **Malta-based bank fined for anti-money laundering breaches** A Malta-based bank owned by a Dutch billionaire has been fined by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) for some [major shortcomings in its anti-money laundering processes](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/bank-owned-dutch-billionaire-fined-antimoney-laundering-breaches.978758). Novum Bank, owned by Dutch entrepreneur Marcel Boekhoorn, was hit with an €89,000 fine and ordered to tighten up its checks on clients. ### **Opinion: call for a European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime** The increasing complexity of EU financial and anti-financial crime regulation has made it increasingly difficult for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) to keep up with regulatory developments. This has led to growing calls for the establishment of a [European centre of excellence for regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/need-european-centre-excellence-antimoney-laundering-compliance.979691) to provide training and guidance, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. ### **Report: The biggest money laundering risks must be given top priority** De Nederlandsche Bank has published a [report on preventing and combating financial crime](https://www.dnb.nl/en/general-news/2022/biggest-money-laundering-risks-must-be-given-top-priority/). Entitled ‘From recovery to balance’, it argues for more risk-based customer due diligence and recommends focussing on the high-risk customer categories. ### **Money laundering through Payment Gateways and Buy Now Pay Later schemes** The Covid-19 pandemic threw India’s economy into chaos and Chinese scammers took advantage by flooding the market with legitimate-looking micro-loan and betting apps, which they turned out to be scandalous and robbed thousands of users of their money. Many companies are now facing scrutiny as their [due-diligence methods failed](https://regtechtimes.com/money-laundering-through-payment-gateway/) to prevent transactions with fraudulent merchants. ### **Regulator details “Frankly shocking” AML breaches at Sydney casino** Star Entertainment Group, Australia’s second biggest operator, has been found unfit to hold a casino licence in Sydney. An inquiry by Australia’s New South Wales state gambling regulator into alleged [breaches of anti-money laundering laws and criminal infiltration](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-state-regulator-says-star-unfit-hold-casino-licence-2022-09-13/), identified “systemic governance, risk and cultural failures”. ### **Webinar: Money laundering through the property sector: Headline cases in review** While the property sector has faced increasingly stringent anti-money laundering regulations across the globe, often these regulations are poorly enforced. Public records can go a long way toward flagging and investigating suspicious real estate transactions, particularly when records are centralised, networked, and searchable. Join this webinar on September 28 at 1pm ET for a discussion on money laundering in the real estate market and examples of how to trace nefarious actors’ real estate assets in Sayari Graph. ## Legislation, Regulation and Sustainability ### **Report: FATF and INTERPOL intensify global asset recovery** The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and INTERPOL have launched a [joint initiative](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/methodsandtrends/documents/fatf-interpol-2022.html) to increase global efforts to recover illicit assets. While asset recovery is key to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, it is estimated that countries intercept and recover less than one per cent of global illicit financial flows. ### **FATF Report: Japan strengthens measures to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing** Since the 2021 assessment, Japan has taken several actions to strengthen its framework. As a result, the FATF has [re-rated the country](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fur-japan-2022.html) on Recommendation 2 from Partially Compliant to Largely Compliant. Japan is now compliant on 4 Recommendations, largely compliant on 25, and partially compliant on 9 Recommendations. Japan will remain in enhanced follow up and will continue to inform the FATF of its progress. ### **Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry on illicit finance – evidence deadline 27 September** The deadline for submissions of initial written evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee’s ‘[Responding to illicit and emerging finance](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6495/)’ inquiry has been extended to Tuesday 27 Sept 2022. The inquiry, announced on 1 Feb 2022, will assess the effectiveness of the UK’s response to the challenge of cross-border illicit finance and builds on the “Moscow’s Gold” report. ### **FCA calls on the financial industries to ‘embed’ the use of data and technology** An executive director of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has called on the financial industries to [‘embed’ the use of data and technology](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fighting-financial-crime-force-multiplier-effect) in order to ward off financial crime. Speaking at The Financial Crime Summit, Sarah Pritchard warned that financial crime would worsen in light of the cost-of-living crisis and advised firms to plan how they will respond to the increased risks. “My message to all firms is this: embed your financial crime checks in your systems from day one, but keep evolving as the threats evolve,” she said. “Use the power of data and tech, and stay alert for situations in which you may need to recalibrate your defences and alerts.” Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets, FCA ### **Quick Guide: Money laundering through the gambling industry** The Basel Institute on Governance has published a quick [guide](https://baselgovernance.org/publications/quick-guide-28-money-laundering-through-gambling-industry) which sets out how criminals abuse the gambling industry to launder illicit funds. It includes case studies to illustrate the different ways criminals launder money in casinos, online gambling websites, bars and clubs, as well as physical and online sports betting services. The guide also explores what gambling businesses and public authorities can do to better prevent and detect money laundering in this sector. ### **Dekleptification guide: Seizing windows of opportunity to dismantle kleptocracy** This [guide](https://civil.ge/archives/507589) was created as a resource for USAID staff working in countries mired in severe corruption, particularly those whose courageous citizens open windows of opportunity for reform. It also aims to set the agenda for the broader community of donors, implementing partners, scholars, and other experts who are focussed on countering kleptocracy and corruption. ### **OCCRP publishes a ‘Follow the Money’ handbook in Spanish** OCCRP has released “¡Sigan el dinero!” (Follow the Money). This free Spanish-language handbook is available [here](https://id.occrp.org/) and contains tools, instructions, and tips on how to find records and databases in 19 Latin American countries, as well as in the US, Belize, and the British Virgin Islands, which are prime havens for stolen money. ### **Singapore: Strengthening AML/CFT practices for external asset managers** The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has published an [information paper](https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2022/strengthening-amlcft-practices-for-external-asset-managers) which sets out supervisory expectations for effective AML/CFT frameworks and controls, together with good practices and illustrative examples observed. ### **Video: A whistleblower’s greenwashing allegations and their impact** Desiree Fixler was fired from her position as head of sustainability at German asset manager DWS. Her dismissal came after she warned the company it was [overstating its sustainable investment credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8TzL5-pSYo). While DWS has always denied Fixler’s allegations, her public statements have sparked official investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. “This whole saga culminating in this police raid, is the wake-up call for the ESG market. A sustainability officer is not a marketing officer, a sustainability officer should be considered a compliance officer.” Desiree Fixler, former DWS Sustainability Officer ### **New Royal warrants will require proof of commitment to sustainability and the environment** Cadbury and Heinz are among around 800 firms who will have to re-apply for a Royal Warrant after the prestigious label became void following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and will be required to demonstrate that they have an appropriate [environmental and sustainability policy and action plan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62891159). ### **ESG policies should take note of the consequences of illegal wildlife trade and poaching** The Illegal wildlife trade has [far-reaching consequences](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/consequences-of-illegal-wildlife-trade/) and impacts society not just through loss of biodiversity, but the emergence of new virus diseases, economic decline, and leads to violence and other criminal activities. ## Crypto & Virtual Assets **Into the Metaverse: Risks and Rewards** Financial services firms are increasingly exploring how they can use the metaverse to provide new products and services to customers. As with the adoption of any new technology, this presents a series of risks and challenges. There is also a connection between the metaverse and Web3 as various items inside the metaverse could be NFTs, such as an avatar or virtual real estate. **Why cryptocurrencies remain of interest to criminals** In recent times cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have become easier to trace, major darknet platforms have been taken down by law enforcement, and internal financial crime investigation units have upgraded their technological financial crime prevention solutions. Yet the amount that is [connected to illicit activity](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/why-cryptocurrencies-are-interesting-for-criminals/) still accounts for more than the authorities would like. **Europol sees the tools to tackle crime in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies** Europol has acknowledged that while abuse increases with use in the case of cryptocurrency, it also noted that blockchain technologies offer authorities a new opportunity to fight crime', summary='Date: 2022-09-16 | Source: KYC360 Weekly Roundup | Legal Status: N/A | Article discusses general trends and issues in AML, Web3, cryptocurrencies, and financial crime risks but contains no specific information related to Lukoil’s financial crimes, AML violations, sanctions breaches, or compliance actions.', hyde_score=0.51),\n",

In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas. The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 10 of the regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters. It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions. If you are unclear about any aspect of the regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice. Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the regulations are set out below. 1.1 Non-government controlled territory of Ukraine --------------------------------------------------- The territorial scope of certain measures in the regulations is ‘non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’. This is defined in regulation 2 as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts’. ‘Crimea’ is further defined as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. 1.2 Designation of persons --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of the financial and/or director disqualification and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions if they are, or have been, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in [regulation 6 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/6)). The regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the purposes of the financial and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list) provides details of the people designated under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated. 1.3 Specification of ships --------------------------- The regulations provide that the Secretary of State may specify a ship for the purposes of shipping sanctions if the ship is, has been, or is likely to be, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 57F of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)). The regulations also provide that the Secretary of State must specify a ship by its International Maritime Organization number or, where it is not reasonably practicable to identify it by that number, by any other means that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The [UK Sanctions List](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list)provides details of the ships specified under the regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been specified. #### The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations 2024 These [regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/made) came into force on 31 July 2024. They amend regulation 57F (specification of ships) so that a ship may be specified for any activity whose object or effect is to: * destabilise Ukraine or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine, or to * obtain a benefit from or support the Government of Russia This includes, but is not limited to, carrying military or dual-use goods from a third country to Russia, as well as oil or oil products that originated in Russia. Ships specified under Regulation 57F will be subject to ‘shipping sanctions’, namely measures in regulations 57A to 57E. Where shipping sanctions apply, a specified ship: * is prohibited from entering a port in the UK * may be given a movement or a port entry direction * can be detained, and * will be refused permission to register on the UK Ship Register or have its existing registration terminated These regulations also amend regulation 6 (designation criteria) to include additional activities for which a person may designated, namely: * providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology to persons involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia (as defined in the Regulations); and * owning or controlling directly or indirectly, or working as a director, trustee, other manager or equivalent of a person, other than an individual, involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine The former expands the criteria under the Regulations to designate entities, including foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions on behalf of, or in support of, specified sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. This in line with G7 commitments to further curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system which Russia is using to facilitate its war in Ukraine. An [explanatory memorandum](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/834/memorandum/contents) accompanies the regulations, providing further information on their provisions. 1.4 Financial sanctions ------------------------ #### Asset freeze and making available provisions The regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly. These prohibitions also apply in relation to entities owned or controlled by a designated person. The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is the authority for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury. OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. See more information about [how OFSI implements financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-financial-sanctions-guidance). #### Other financial and investment restrictions The regulations prohibit a person from directly or', summary='Date: 2025-07-22 | Source: GOV.UK | Article discusses UK government statutory guidance on Russia sanctions, including financial sanctions enforcement, licensing, and compliance requirements.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897). [For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list). See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Specifically, Eduard Benderskiy, a former FSB officer and father-in-law of Evil Corp leader Maksim Yakubets, was sanctioned for materially assisting Evil Corp and acting on behalf of the Russian government. Benderskiy’s private security firm provided security services for Lukoil facilities in Iraq around 2017. OFAC designated Benderskiy and his companies Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to Executive Orders 14024 and 13694 for supporting Evil Corp activities. While no direct allegations or investigations of Lukoil itself for financial crimes, AML deficiencies, or sanctions violations are stated, the involvement of a security firm linked to Lukoil’s operations with a sanctioned individual raises potential reputational and compliance risks. No charges, fines, or enforcement actions against Lukoil were reported. No information on Lukoil’s AML program or compliance measures provided.

Please contact [webmaster@usdoj.gov](mailto:webmaster@usdoj.gov) if you have any questions about the archive site. Press Release Former Energy Trader for Vitol Inc. Pleads Guilty to International Bribery Scheme ================================================================================= Thursday, August 22, 2024 **For Immediate Release** Office of Public Affairs A former energy trader pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to bribe Mexican government officials to secure contracts for his then-employer, Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S.affiliate of the largest independent energy trading firm in the world. According to court documents, Javier Aguilar, 50, of Houston, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PEMEX Procurement International, Inc. (PPI), a wholly owned affiliate of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), in exchange for assistance in winning business for Vitol. “Javier Aguilar has now admitted that he bribed foreign officials to win business when he worked as an oil and gas trader at Vitol Inc., using shell companies, fake contracts, sham invoices, and alias email accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Aguilar’s guilty plea yesterday follows his conviction at trial on related charges earlier this year. His illegal conduct netted Vitol hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, and now he will pay the price.” “With yesterday\\'s guilty plea, the defendant admits his role in the widespread corruption of the international commodities market and to casting aside laws and rules that apply to all to unfairly line the pockets of the few,” said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. “The actions of the defendant and his co-conspirators, and of those who act similarly, destroy people’s faith in their governments, disadvantage those who play by the rules, undermine confidence in American businesses worldwide, and will not be tolerated by this Office or our law enforcement partners.” “The Southern District of Texas is ground zero in the fight against foreign bribery and corruption in Latin America,” said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. “My office’s prosecutors — experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — will continue to bring to justice those who damage the integrity of Texas’s vital energy sector with illegal advantages fueled by greed. This guilty plea begins the process of repairing the damage caused by Aguilar as well as putting on notice those who might seek to emulate him and his cohorts.” “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been the law of the land, and enforceable worldwide, for decades. Yet unscrupulous businessmen still try to bribe their way to profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. “My message to them is that the charges and penalties you will face are not worth the gain. I want to commend the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Office of International Affairs; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas for their diligence pursuing this case, but especially the agents and analysts who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of FCPA violators.” Between 2017 and 2020, Aguilar, who was a trader in Vitol’s Houston office, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PPI to obtain numerous contracts for Vitol to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of ethane to PEMEX. To conceal the scheme, Aguilar and his co-conspirators used a series of fake contracts, sham invoices and shell entities incorporated in Curaçao and Mexico. The defendant and his co-conspirators also used alias email accounts to communicate about the scheme and code words, including “shoes,” “medicine,” “invitations,” and “coffee,” to describe the bribes. Aguilar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to a violation of the Travel Act. The FCPA conspiracy charge, which was brought by a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas, related to conduct that was initially charged in the Eastern District of New York. As part of his guilty plea, Aguilar consented to transfer the Texas case to New York, to consolidate the cases, and to forfeit $7,129,938. The plea follows Aguilar’s related [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-oil-and-gas-trader-convicted-role-foreign-bribery-and-money-laundering-scheme) at trial in February 2024 for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, violating the FCPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with schemes to bribe Ecuadorian and Mexican officials. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment on the money laundering offense and five years’ imprisonment on each of the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. In December 2020, Vitol [admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/vitol-inc-agrees-pay-over-135-million-resolve-foreign-bribery-case) to bribing officials in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the U.S.Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York. As a part of the resolution, Vitol agreed to pay a combined $135 million in penalties as part of a coordinated resolution with the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and authorities in Brazil. Seven of the defendant’s co-conspirators have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing. These individuals have agreed to forfeit more than $63 million in connection with this and related schemes. FBI Miami’s International Corruption Squad investigated the case. Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan P. Lax, Matthew R. Galeotti, and Nick M. Axelrod for the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sherin Daniel and Deputy Chief Suzanne Elmilady for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The MLARS Special Financial Investigations Unit and Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance. The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at[www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa). The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to [kleptocracy@usdoj.gov](mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov)or[https://tips.fbi.gov/](https://tips.fbi.gov/).

Des dizaines de sociétés qui, avant la guerre en Ukraine, opéraient depuis Genève y ont renforcé leur présence ou créé une nouvelle entité. Pour l'heure, les géants du trading n’apparaissent quasiment plus parmi les acheteurs de pétrole russe. De petites entités opaques, dont certaines sont proches du Kremlin, ont pris le relai. Public Eye a enquêté entre la Cité de Calvin et le paradis fiscal doubaïote. Agathe Duparc et Manuel Abebe (en collaboration avec Robert Bachmann), 21 novembre 2023 * [Matières premières](/fr/tag/matieres-premieres) * [Pétrole](/fr/tag/petrole) * [Ukraine](/fr/tag/ukraine) Une matinée comme les autres au rez-de-chaussée de la gigantesque Almas Tower, le siège du [Dubai Multi Commodities Centre](https://www.dmcc.ae/free-zone) (DMCC). Nous sommes au cœur de la bête: l’une des plus importantes plateformes de trading de matières premières au monde, créée en 2002 par l’Émirat de Dubaï. Près de 23'000 entreprises y sont enregistrées, pour la plupart des sociétés de négoce venues du monde entier, actives dans le commerce de diamants, céréales, thé, café et hydrocarbures. À l’entrée, les visiteurs sont accueillis par les portraits des trois cheikhs vedettes des Émirats arabes unis, dont celui de Mohammed ben Rachid al-Maktoum, l’émir et bienfaiteur de Dubaï dont la fortune est estimée à 14 milliards de dollars US. Des groupes attendent leurs badges, dans le ballet incessant des ascenseurs qui montent jusqu’au 68e étage. Un homme, croyant avoir à faire à une businesswoman, me glisse sa carte de visite, précisant que sa société, pourvoyeuse de services en tout genre, est accréditée auprès du gouvernement local et peut répondre «à n’importe quel besoin». «Vous venez de Suisse? Ah, très bien!». La conversation n’ira pas plus loin. Dans la galerie circulaire qui abrite des restaurants et des cafés, la maquette du quartier d’affaires est exposée: 87 gratte-ciel plantés comme des arbres autour d’un lac artificiel sur plus de 200 hectares. Ces tours offrent bureaux, résidences de luxe et hôtels, sans oublier les salles de sport, restaurants, crèches et magasins pour chiens et chats, qui sont légion. Près de 100'000 personnes travaillent dans cette zone franche. Ici, on bosse DMCC, on vit DMCC, on mange DMCC, l’acronyme ayant même donné son nom à une station de métro. La fourmilière vaque à ses occupations lorsqu’une nouvelle tombe: pour la 9e année consécutive, le DMCC a été sacrée meilleure zone franche du monde ([prix du magazine FDI du Financial Times](https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-awarded-global-free-zone-year-9th-year-row)). Deux jeunes femmes dans des imperméables beiges de détective et coiffées de chapeaux prennent des photos en rafale, alors que des hôtesses en robes à paillettes distribuent sourires et roses blanches. Ravis, les hôtes de passage posent derrière un cadre aux couleurs du DMCC. L’événement n’aura pas duré plus d’une demi-heure. Le DMCC n’est que l’une des trente zones économiques spéciales de Dubaï mais, depuis l’entrée en vigueur des sanctions contre la Russie et de l’embargo sur le pétrole – le 5 décembre 2022 pour le brut et le 5 février 2023 pour les produits raffinés –, elle s’est imposée comme la juridiction préférée des sociétés de négoce qui veulent poursuivre, en toute quiétude, leurs affaires avec la Russie. En particulier celles qui opéraient auparavant depuis la Suisse. En septembre 2023, une délégation du DMCC s’est rendue à Genève et Zurich pour une [visite promotionnelle](https://swisstrade.com/news/detail/news/dubais-groesste-freihandelszone-wirbt-um-schweizer-firmen/). Son directeur, Ahmed bin Sulayem, a annoncé qu’en deux ans, le nombre de sociétés suisses inscrites dans la zone franche avait augmenté de 30%. Les Émirats arabes unis, tout occupés à leur fabuleuse croissance économique, n’ont pas adopté de sanctions et affichent une [neutralité bienveillante à l’égard de la Russie](https://fmes-france.org/que-penser-des-relations-entre-les-emirats-arabes-unis-et-la-russie/) et de sa guerre d’agression. Les sociétés dubaïotes ne sont donc pas tenues d’acheter le pétrole russe en respectant le «prix plafond» (price cap) fixé par les Occidentaux (pas plus de 60 dollars pour le baril de brut; 100 dollars pour le diesel et le kérosène; 45 dollars pour certains fiouls), alors que les négociants basés en Suisse et dans les pays de l’Union européenne (UE) et du G7 doivent s’y soumettre pour pouvoir continuer à commercer avec Moscou – pour autant que le pétrole soit livré à des pays qui n’appliquent pas les sanctions. Cette mesure phare avait été mise en place afin de permettre à la Russie de continuer à écouler ses produits – condition sine qua non pour éviter une flambée des prix sur le marché du pétrole – tout en faisant diminuer les revenus qui alimentent la machine de guerre de Vladimir Poutine en Ukraine. ## Récupérer les flux de pétrole russe Ici, personne ne s’étonne du fait que Dubaï, qui fait le lien entre le monde occidental et les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud), soit, en quelques mois, devenu le nouvel épicentre du négoce de pétrole russe, menaçant de détrôner Genève. [Selon nos estimations](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/les-amities-brut-du-kremlin), 50 à 60% du pétrole brut russe était négocié depuis la Suisse avant la guerre en Ukraine, essentiellement dans la Cité de Calvin. Public Eye a pu se procurer les déclarations d’exportation de pétrole brut russe remplies par les fournisseurs auprès des douanes russes entre début janvier et fin juillet 2023. Outre des informations sur les volumes achetés et les prix, ces données permettent de connaître les ports de chargement en Russie, ainsi que le nom des vendeurs et des acheteurs. Résultat: durant les sept premiers mois de 2023, les sociétés enregistrées à Dubaï (toutes zones franches confondues) se sont taillé la part du lion. Elles ont acheté plus de la moitié des volumes de pétrole brut annoncés à l’exportation depuis les quatre principaux ports russes (Oust-Luga, Primorsk, Novorossiïsk, Kozmino), pour une valeur d’au moins 14 milliards de dollars US. Six des dix plus gros acheteurs privés de brut russe par voie maritime sont basés aux Émirats arabes unis. Notre analyse montre comment, en une année seulement, la carte mondiale du commerce a été redessinée: les volumes auparavant vendus depuis la Suisse et Singapour par des traders privés se négocient désormais principalement à partir de Dubaï et Hong Kong. «Dubaï a toujours cherché à protéger son économie des fluctuations politiques mondiales. Aujourd’hui, les autorités veulent se diversifier et récupérer le négoce de pétrole russe. Elles font un job remarquable!», estime l’analyste d’une société de trading qui a quitté il y a un an la tranquillité de la Suisse pour plonger dans le chaudron des Émirats. «L’attrait pour Dubaï n’est pas nouveau. Il y a eu la fin du secret bancaire en Suisse, le Covid-19, mais depuis le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le mouvement s’est beaucoup accéléré et tout le monde veut être ici», précise-t-il, acceptant de nous parler uniquement sous couvert d’anonymat. Une exigence partagée par la douzaine de personnes que nous avons interrogées. Le secteur se perd en conjectures, entre ceux qui pensent que le phénomène est temporaire et ceux qui estiment qu’un point de non-retour a été atteint. Un trader russe qui a travaillé chez les plus grands négociants genevois parlait, il y a quelques mois, de «blague» quand on évoquait un repli sur Dubaï. Il pointait l’absence totale de culture du financement du négoce au sein des banques émiraties. Nous le retrouvons au bar d’un grand hôtel du centre financier DIFC (Dubai International Finance Centre). Il prédit désormais que «ces dix prochaines années, personne ne pourra concurrencer Dubaï», où il passe désormais la moitié de son temps en qualité de consultant. Il estime cependant que la Suisse est loin d’avoir perdu tous ses attraits. Pour preuve: les géants du négoce y sont encore solidement implantés, actifs sur d’autres marchés et soucieux de maintenir les liens avec leurs banquiers. Quant aux plus petits traders, même en cas de déménagement à Dubaï, la plupart ont conservé une structure sur les bords du Léman. «Pourquoi la fermer? Cela permet d’avoir toujours un pied en Occident et, surtout, de maintenir les relations avec les banques suisses qui financent le négoce, même si elles ne touchent plus aux produits russes», remarque-t-il. ## La rue du Rhône sur 78 étages Dès l’été 2022, en prévision de la mise en place de cet embargo historique, les géants genevois Trafigura, Vitol et Gunvor, partenaires historiques des sociétés pétrolières étatiques russes comme Rosneft, ont disparu du top 10 des acheteurs de pétrole russe, craignant pour leur réputation. Ils ont peu à peu été remplacés par des traders peu connus ou par des «pop-up», ces sociétés au profil totalement opaque qui ont surgi sur le marché sans qu’il soit possible de savoir exactement qui sont leurs propriétaires. Voir notre enquête [Négoce de pétrole russe en Suisse: des adieux en trompe-l’œil?](https://www.publiceye.ch/fr/thematiques/ukraine/negoce-de-matieres-premieres/negoce-de-petrole-russe-en-suisse-des-adieux-en-trompe-loeil) Les plus gros négociants en pétrole avaient déjà ouvert une antenne dans le petit paradis émirati dès le début des années 2010, comme le montre le [registre des entités du DMCC](https://landing.dmcc.ae/public-search). Ces filiales doubaïotes se sont étoffées. Et d’autres ont vu le jour. Le géant genevois Gunvor était présent depuis 2011 avec Gunvor Middle East DMCC, mais en octobre 2022, une autre entité a vu le jour: Gunvor Energy Trading DMCC, spécifiquement dédiée aux transactions avec la Russie. Elle est à l’heure actuelle quasiment «en sommeil», comme le montrent les données douanières russes. Même scénario pour Vitol et Trafigura. Du côté de Litasco, se replier sur Dubaï était une nécessité. Avant la guerre en Ukraine, un tiers des volumes de pétrole négociés par le trader russe, dont le siège est toujours à Genève, provenait des champs pétroliers de sa maison-mère, Lukoil. Pour continuer ses activités, il a catapulté, dès l’été 2022, la moitié de son personnel, soit une centaine de personnes, dans la fournaise de Dubaï, au 18e étage de l’Almas Tower. Elles sont désormais employées par Litasco Middle East DMCC et viennent d’emménager dans l’[Uptown Tower](https://uptowndubai.ae/en/), le dernier bijou du DMCC. Cette tour ultra-luxueuse de 78 étages a poussé en cinq ans, un peu à l’écart du quartier, et ses alentours en construction sont encore poussiéreux. Selon nos informations, Trafigura PTE LTD (DMCC branch), Socar Trading Middle East DMCC, Sahara Energy DMCC ou encore [Wellbred](https://wellbred.com/) Trading DMCC (une compagnie singapourienne également basée à Genève) y sont aussi installées. À la réception, on nous explique qu’il est impossible de fournir la liste complète des locataires des 23 étages de bureaux, car «ce n’est pas la politique de la maison».

Hafeez](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/sahar-hafeez.html) [Samantha Franks](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/) Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-partnering-cross-agency-trade-fraud-task-force) the launch of a “cross-agency” Trade Fraud Task Force “to bring robust enforcement against importers and other parties who seek to defraud the United States.” According to DOJ, the Task Force will “augment the existing coordination mechanisms” within DOJ and leverage expertise from DOJ’s Civil and Criminal Divisions and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against any parties who seek to evade tariffs and other duties, as well as smugglers who seek to import prohibited goods into the American economy.” The Task Force announcement occurs against the backdrop of [intensified tariff activity](https://www.globaltradeandsanctionslaw.com/snapshot-of-current-tariff-actions-and-negotiations/), including reciprocal tariffs on nearly every trading partner, and [investigations on imports of critical materials](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/section-232-pharma-semiconductors-crit-minerals-trucks.html) from semiconductors to metals and minerals and pharmaceuticals under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. While statutes such as the False Claims Act (FCA) have occasionally predicated trade-related actions in the past, the Task Force represents a concerted effort by the U.S. government to bring greater resources, statutory authorities and prosecutorial power to bear on alleged customs violations. The Task Force is expected to promote coordination between DOJ and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to target evasion schemes, including false origin declarations, misclassification, fraudulent under-valuations and other alleged violations that undermine tariff policy and deprive the Government of tariff revenue. As discussed further below, this will likely include not only traditional CBP civil penalty enforcement but also civil *and* criminal actions under the FCA and statutes such as wire fraud, importing through false statements, and conspiracy. For importers, this dual pressure—policy expansion coupled with enforcement escalation—creates a complex compliance environment. While the announcement provides important information about how the Task Force will operate, importers and related businesses should stay attuned to the broader trade enforcement context and the open questions that remain in order to assess and mitigate their own risk. At the end of this piece we offer discrete recommendations, including audit and supply chain compliance that incorporates increased risk of DOJ involvement and FCA claims; internal and external reporting mechanisms for potential violations, from both companies and their competitors; and monitoring fast-moving legislative, judicial and regulatory developments that can impact import compliance. **How the Task Force Will Operate** On the personnel front, the Task Force will consist of litigators from the Criminal and Civil Divisions at DOJ. From the Criminal Division, the Task Force will include prosecutors from the Fraud Section’s newly established [Market, Government, and Consumer Fraud Unit](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/mgc-unit). Within the Civil Division, the announcement indicates the Task Force will be supported by members of the Commercial Litigation Branch’s Civil Fraud Section (which conducts False Claims Act enforcement) and National Courts Section (which has responsibility for civil customs fraud actions). According to the announcement, attorneys on the Task Force “will work closely with” investigators from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which are both part of DHS. As for strategy, DOJ’s announcement anchors the Task Force in the “America First Trade Policy” Presidential Memorandum (Jan. 20, 2025) and Executive Order 14243, “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos” (Mar. 20, 2025). According to DOJ, the Task Force will advance these policies by pursuing: (a) customs laws violations through duty and penalty collection actions under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Tariff Act”); (b) civil actions under the False Claims Act; and (c) parallel criminal prosecutions, penalties and seizures under Title 18’s trade fraud and conspiracy provisions. CBP enforces the civil penalty provisions of section 592 the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1592. Under the customs law, importers are held to a standard of reasonable care, which requires that importers exercise diligence to make accurate declarations regarding the classification, valuation, country of origin and applicable duty rates for imported merchandise. Section 1592(a) provides that “no person, by fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, may enter, introduce, or attempt to enter any merchandise” into U.S. commerce by means of a material misrepresentation or omission, or aid and abet such a violation. Where CBP has reasonable cause to believe an importer has violated section 1592, it may issue a written penalty notice seeking liquidated damages. Liquidated damages can range from a civil penalty of up to twice the duties owed (for negligence), to the full domestic value of the merchandise (for fraud)—though, after receiving a penalty notice, importers have the opportunity to seek mitigation of monetary penalties under the customs regulations, 19 C.F.R. Part 171. In addition to seeking civil monetary penalties under the Tariff Act, the Task Force announcement also reaffirms that DOJ will rely on other enforcement tools like the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729. The FCA has been called the government’s “[most powerful tool](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2000/March/159dag.htm)” for combatting fraud against the United States. Although the DOJ has not often used the FCA to bring trade fraud enforcement actions, the Ninth Circuit has [recently held](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/06/23/22-55063.pdf) that false claims can include not only fraudulent requests for payment but also evasion of obligations to pay customs duties otherwise owed to the government. And, in addition to per-violation civil penalties, the FCA authorizes courts to impose treble damages, which means that knowing violators could end up paying three times the amount of duties owed. Finally, a trade fraud investigation may implicate a number of criminal offenses in Title 18 of the United States Code, including sections 287 (criminal false claims), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 541 (false classification of goods), 542 (importing through false statements), 545 (smuggling), 1001 (false statements to government officials), 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1349 (attempt and conspiracy to commit fraud), 1956 (money laundering), and 1957 (transactions in laundered funds). With the exception of sections 287 and 371, all of these offenses could give rise to criminal or civil forfeiture. That means, even absent a criminal conviction, DOJ could file a civil complaint, with a lower burden of proof, that seeks to forfeit the proceeds of trade fraud, a forfeiture money judgment in the same amount, or—in the case of money laundering—any property involved in a transaction with laundered funds. **The Broader Context** Prosecuting trade fraud is not new to DOJ. As the announcement recognizes, the Civil Division has resolved a number of trade prosecutions in 2025. Nor is the idea of a Trade Fraud Task Force new to the Department. As recently as March 2024, DOJ [praised](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ford-motor-company-agrees-pay-365m-settle-customs-civil-penalty-claims-relating) the work of a “Trade Fraud Task Force” in supporting a $365 million settlement with Ford Motor Company to resolve allegations that it violated the Tariff Act of 1930 by misclassifying and undervaluing hundreds of thousands of cargo vans imported from Turkey. Nonetheless, the 2025 version of the Task Force merits serious attention. First, DOJ has formally added the Criminal Division and HSI to the Task Force. The involvement of prosecutors and criminal investigators is likely to increase the number of trade fraud investigations, if not enforcement actions. Second, trade fraud prosecutions are being prioritized in a way they were not previously. That sends a message to agents and prosecutors that trade fraud cases are more likely to get leadership and press attention, which could incentivize working on Task Force matters instead of other investigations. Third, the Task Force announcement expressly encourages relators to alert the government to credible allegations of trade fraud by utilizing the FCA’s *qui* *tam* provisions to file sealed complaints on behalf of the United States. While *qui tam* complaints have long been an avenue for reporting fraud, the DOJ’s express receptiveness to reviewing and potentially acting on trade fraud complaints is new and likely to yield more such reports from an increasingly active relator-side bar. The addition of the Criminal Division to the Task Force is also significant. Trade penalties in the customs arena, including under the Tariff Act, have historically involved civil monetary penalties. Recent policy changes, however, increase the likelihood that trade fraud allegations and investigations develop into criminal prosecutions. In May 2025, the Division [expanded](http://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/140004) the scope of offenses that are eligible for its Corporate Whistleblower Awards Pilot Program to include corporate violations relating to trade, tariff and customs fraud. On September 16, 2025, the Criminal Division’s Acting Assistant Attorney General, Matthew R. Galeotti, [disclosed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-association) that, in the past four months, the Division received 313 whistleblower tips and that 120 of them—including tips relating to trade fraud—warranted further investigation. Also in May, the Division announced that it had [revised](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400031) its Corporate Enforcement Policy (CEP) to further encourage companies to voluntarily self-disclose misconduct—including misconduct relating to trade fraud. Under the revised CEP, absent aggravating circumstances, a company that voluntarily self-discloses, fully cooperates and remediates, and pays all forfeiture and restitution is *entitled* to a declination rather than a *presumption* of a declination. This is significant because the Tariff Act itself provides a mechanism for “prior disclosure,” which allows importers to disclose potential past violations to avoid more exacting monetary penalties. Accordingly, importers considering a prior disclosure to CBP should now also consult with counsel about making a voluntary self-disclosure under the Criminal Division’s CEP. **Unresolved Questions** Notwithstanding the information provided by DOJ about the new Task Force, a number of questions remain. The announcement did not include certain operational details, such as where within DOJ the Task Force will reside, who will lead its day-to-day work, or whether the Task Force will report on its activities beyond press releases describing individual cases. The announcement also did not indicate whether the Task Force will benefit from the allocation of any dedicated resources, whether agents or attorneys. A/AAG Galeotti did, however, recently [announce](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/acting-assistant-attorney-general-matthew-r-galeotti-delivers-remarks-global) that the Criminal Division would be “leading” DOJ’s effort to investigate and prosecute trade fraud, with a “particular focus” on cases involving (1) “long-running efforts to evade hundreds of millions in tariffs, including tariffs on Chinese products,” and (2) trade fraud schemes involving corporate executives. Some of the open questions may be answered through pending legislation. For example, legislators in the House’s Select Committee on the Chinese Community Party have reintroduced the bipartisan [Protecting American Industry and Labor from International Trade Crimes Act](https://mcusercontent.com/ffedde7e54b71a41a9505fff1/files/893afae6-3edc-b4f7-15a7-50a9afa42c35/HINSON_010_xml.pdf). Among other things, the Act would require the Criminal Division to establish a task force to prosecute trade crimes, and appropriate $20 million for the Division to hire and train prosecutors and investigators and conduct enforcement actions. Depending on the mix of attorneys, investigators and staff, this could result in the addition of as many as 50 to 60 personnel to the Task Force, and the more dedicated resources that are assigned to the Task Force, the more enforcement activity that can be expected. Congress may influence trade fraud prosecutions in other ways. For example, the Chairman of China Select Committee recently sent a [letter to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/) asking the agency to investigate an importer over the evasion of steep tariffs on Chinese goods—highlighting that Congress has also turned its attention to issues such as misclassification or transshipment of merchandise. Other questions may be addressed by the Supreme Court. On November 5, the Court will hear the U.S. government’s appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision in *V.O.S. Selections v. Trump*, which held that the President lacked the authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose reciprocal tariffs and the so-called “fentanyl” tariffs. Even if the Supreme Court allows the lower court ruling invalidating these tariffs to stand, many tariffs will remain in place, including tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles under Section 232, tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 imposed on China during President Trump’s first term, and antidumping and countervailing', summary='Date: 2025-06-30 (approximate, based on article context) | Source: Global Trade & Sanctions Law (Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP) | Legal Status: No specific Lukoil-related allegations or investigations reported | Article discusses the launch of the U.S. DOJ’s new cross-agency Trade Fraud Task Force aimed at combating trade-related fraud, including customs violations, tariff evasion, and false claims under statutes such as the False Claims Act and criminal provisions in Title 18.

In a recent case, [_United States v. Frank Ahlgren III_](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-charged-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency-gains#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20indictment%2C%20between,which%20he%20had%20substantial%20gains.), Federal prosecutors allege that between 2017 and 2019, the defendant failed report gains from the sale of appreciated bitcoin on his federal income tax returns. If the allegations are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, this case is tax evasion in its plainest form. This case is unlike prior criminal cases that involved cryptocurrency. Previous cases included tax evasion allegations as an additional set of charges on top of allegations of other criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, theft, trafficking contraband or terrorism financing. In _Ahlgren_, the defendant legally bought and sold bitcoin, and faces no allegations of other illegal activity. This case is novel because it focuses purely on tax evasion with an underlying legal, cryptocurrency fact pattern. _Ahlgren_ is significant because it signals a willingness and readiness by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to investigate potential tax abuse and pursue civil and criminal tax cases. IRS spokespeople have previously indicated that the IRS would prosecute crypto tax crimes when it feels comfortable that it could win a conviction from a federal jury. In other words, the IRS feels comfortable fielding a jury that understands cryptocurrency enough to convict on tax evasion. If the IRS believes it will prevail (and usually does), we should expect more federal income tax audits and tax controversy activity of this kind.

на 1,7 млрд долларов.** Согласно [информации](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/seven-members-moscow-based-criminal-organization-plead-guilty-over-17-billion) Офиса прокурора США в Восточном округе Нью-Йорка, семь членов организованной преступной группировки, находящейся в Москве, признаны виновными в схеме по организации масштабной международной схемы мошенничества в сфере медицины и отмывании денег: они выставили поддельные счета более 50 аптекам на сумму свыше 1,7 миллиардов долларов. Сообщники действовали по всей стране, включая Нью-Йорк, Бруклин, Лонг-Айленд, Статен-Айленд, Нью-Джерси, Техас и др. Лидер группы, гражданин США Брайн Саттон, 31 год, находящийся в Москве, управлял преступной деятельностью из российской столицы, он остается на свободе. Среди обвиняемых значатся: Хафизула Эбади, Джошуа Мануэль Алегрия, Дэвид Гэри Бишофф, Брайсен Кей Миллетт, Дела Сайдазим, Энтони Сантамария и Хершель Цикман, они признали себя виновными. Ответчики участвовали в международной схеме по приобретению аптек по всей территории Соединенных Штатов, имея ранее существовавшие отношения с частными компаниями медицинского страхования. Эти аптеки вместе с колл-центрами использовались, чтобы побудить людей принимать ненужные лекарства, для чего выписывались мошеннические рецепты в аптеках схемы — на этом сеть нанятых врачей и обвиняемые заработали более 1,7 миллиарда долларов. Обвинения против Саттона и других были объявлены 7 ноября 2023 года. Следствие выяснило, что преступная группа выставила мошеннические счета в период с 2017 по 2022 год. Сообщники Саттона обеспечивали поиск аптек, врачей и открытие колл-центров, первые из которых открылись в штате Юта, а вскоре сеть расширилась в другие страны, включая Россию. Сотрудники колл-центров звонили клиентам с предложением купить лекарства по низкой цене без предварительного медобследования. Практикующие медсестры и помощники врачей выписывали рецепты после телемедицинских консультаций, зачастую обманывая врачей о проведении этих визитов, которые фактически не осуществлялись. Рецепты оформлялись на имена врачей и номера их идентификаторов, в результате чего многие бенефициары так и не получили обещанные медикаменты. Для отмывания денег мошенники использовали подставные компании, а также вымышленные персональные данные и средства связи. В преступной группе работали IT-специалисты, которые настраивали программное обеспечение для управления аптечной сетью. Они подготавливали и подавали заявки на возмещение «расходов» в частные страховые компании. В итоге преступникам удалось получить от страховых компаний свыше $500 миллионов. Сроки тюремного заключения, которые грозят членам преступной группы, варьируются от 10 до 30 лет, в то время как некоторым простоит конфискация имущества и штрафы в размере от 1,8 до 520 миллионов долларов. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/10/29/members-of-moscow-criminal-organization-guilty/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Legal Status: No financial crime or compliance information found | Article and website content reviewed contain no information related to money laundering allegations, AML deficiencies, sanctions violations, fraud, corruption, or compliance actions involving Lukoil.', hyde_score=0.4),\n",

Об этом [пишет](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chen-zhi-scam-singapore-police-b2859031.html) Independent. В середине октября 2025 года прокуратура США предъявила предпринимателю обвинения в сговоре с целью мошенничества с использованием электронных средств связи и в сговоре с целью отмывания денег. Как следует из обвинительного заключения, жертвами злоумышленников под эгидой Prince Holding Group стали 250 человек на территории США. В рамках расследования американские власти изъяли биткоинов более чем на $14 млрд. Одновременно власти Великобритании объявили об аресте в Северном Лондоне особняка стоимостью $15,6 млн и офисного здания за $130 млн. Правительства США и Великобритании также ввели совместные санкции против Чжи и его компании. [Российского криптомошенника Пичугина депортируют из Камбоджи](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/68a599ce9a79470187bbf88f) [Общество](https://www.rbc.ru/society/) Затем к расследованию присоединился Сингапур. Местные силовики арестовали финансовые активы Чэня на $114 млн, а также несколько яхт с коллекцией дорогостоящего алкоголя. Четвертого ноября тайваньская прокуратура задержала по делу Чэня 25 подозреваемых и конфисковала у камбоджийского бизнесмена активы на сумму $150 млн. В тот же день полиция Гонконга объявила об изъятии активов Чэня Чжи в виде наличных и акций еще на $353 млн. Prince Holding Group — камбоджийский конгломерат со штаб-квартирой в Пномпене и с дочерними компаниями в десятках стран. У холдинга интересы в разных сферах — недвижимость, финансы, авиация, туризм, логистика, высокие технологии и пищевая промышленность. [На сайте компании](https://www.princeholdinggroup.com/) указано, что она является одним из крупнейших конгломератов Камбоджи. 38-летний Чэнь Чжи, помимо камбоджийского паспорта, имеет гражданство Китая, где он родился. Как выяснило [Associated Press](http://www.ap.org/), Чэнь все еще [остается на свободе](https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-us-uk-online-scam-prince-chen-zhi-bbc3fae393003a16cda22efd5a2ada22). В случае признания его виновным в США ему грозит до 40 лет тюрьмы. Prince Holding Group ранее опровергала свою причастность к мошенническим операциям и публично не отреагировала на последние обвинения. В МВД Камбоджи заявили, что готовы сотрудничать со следователями других государств при наличии официального запроса, подтвержденного доказательствами. **Читайте РБК в [Telegram](https://t.me/+o--H2lU_IO83NmUy).** Поделиться Поделиться Вконтакте Одноклассники Telegram [РБК в MAX](https://max.ru/rbc) [На связи с проверенными новостями](https://max.ru/rbc) [Читайте РБК в MAX!

По данным ФБР, Семёнов, являясь экспертом в области блокчейн-технологий, использовал свои навыки для разработки криптовалютного миксера Tornado Cash. Сервис, изначально позиционировавшийся как инструмент для обеспечения анонимности транзакций, на практике превратился в крупный механизм по отмыванию денег. Через [Tornado Cash](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=Tornado+Cash) было отмыто более 1 миллиарда долларов преступных доходов. Как предполагает ФБР, в апреле и мае 2022 года сервис Tornado Cash предположительно использовался Lazarus Group, северокорейской организацией по киберпреступности, находящейся под санкциями, для отмывания сотен миллионов долларов доходов. Семенов и его сообщники якобы знали, что сервис Tornado Cash, которым они управляли, участвовал в этих нарушающих санкции транзакциях. Они якобы продолжали управлять сервисом и способствовать проведению сотен миллионов долларов, помогая Lazarus Group переводить преступные доходы с криптовалютного кошелька, который был обозначен Управлением по контролю за иностранными активами как заблокированное имущество. 21 августа 2023 года федеральный суд США выдал ордер на арест Семёнова. Ему предъявлены обвинения в сговоре с целью отмывания денег, ведении нелицензированного бизнеса по переводу денежных средств и нарушении Закона о международных чрезвычайных экономических полномочиях. В настоящее время местонахождение Семёнова неизвестно: он может находиться в России, Турции или Объединенных Арабских Эмиратах — в этих странах у него есть установленные связи. В объявлении о розыске его описывают как белого мужчину с каштановыми/коричневыми волосами и зелеными глазами, хотя не исключается, что он мог изменить внешность. Всех, у кого есть информация о местонахождении Семенова, ФБР просит [связаться с ними](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) или с ближайшим американским посольством. *[Виталий Атаев Трошин](https://www.slavicsac.com/?s=%D0%92%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2+%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD),* *[SlavicSac.com](https://slavicsac.com/) [California Local News Fellowship](https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/cafellows/)* #### [ПО ТЕМЕ](#) ### [Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/rashkin-gurzhiy-elections/ \"Юрий Рашкин: “Америка все больше раскалывается”\") ### [42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/06/snap-shutdown/ \"42 миллиона американцев лишаются продовольственной помощи из-за шатдауна\") ### [Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь](https://www.slavicsac.com/2025/11/05/medi-cal-dental-vision-care/ \"Medi-Cal: бесплатная стоматологическая и офтальмологическая помощь\") * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [Эксклюзив](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/ecsclusive/) * [Религия](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/religion/) * [Криминал](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/crime/) * [Общество](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/society/) * [Техно](https://www.slavicsac.com/category/news/techno/) [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/sovoprosnick \"Ebay\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slavicsac \"Facebook\") [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slavicsac/ \"Instagram\") [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/slavicsac \"Paypal\") [Telegram](https://t.me/slavicsac \"Telegram\") [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slavicsac \"Twitter\") [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SacramentoSlavic \"Youtube\") © 2022 Slavic Sacramento | Russian, Ukrainian News in California * [Home](https://www.slavicsac.com/) * [About](https://www.slavicsac.com/about/) * [Contact](https://www.slavicsac.com/contact/) * [Advertisment](https://www.slavicsac.com/ads) * [Copyright & Policy](https://www.slavicsac.com/copyright/) * [News – Новости](https://www.slavicsac.com/latest-news/) [Go to mobile version](https://www.slavicsac.com/2024/08/24/tornado-cash-fbi/?amp=1)', summary='Date: 2025-11-06 | Source: slavicsac.com | Article discusses Lukoil but contains no financial crime or compliance information.', hyde_score=0.36),\n",

Его заподозрили в коррупции и отмывании денег, сообщает The Guardian, ссылаясь на документы федерального уголовного суда Швейцарии. Следствие, согласно документам, пытается установить происхождение состояния Абрамовича, которое он приобрел в России в 1990-х и 2000-х годах. Среди прочего власти острова в рамках расследования запросили данные о счетах в швейцарских банках, которые связывают с бизнесменом. Суд в Швейцарии, несмотря на попытки адвокатов Абрамовича заблокировать обмен документами, постановил, что эту информацию можно передать властям Джерси. Один запрос касается подозрений в отмывании денег, полученных Абрамовичем при продаже компании «Сибнефть» за 13 миллиардов долларов в 2005 году. Второе дело связано с возможным нарушением санкций из-за переводов, совершенных после того, как бизнесмена включили в санкционный список острова Джерси в 2022 году. Абрамович через своих адвокатов отверг все обвинения и заявил, что любые предположения о его причастности к преступной деятельности не соответствуют действительности. Власти острова Джерси весной 2022 года [заблокировали](https://meduza.io/news/2022/04/13/sud-ostrova-dzhersi-zamorozil-aktivy-romana-abramovicha-na-7-milliardov-dollarov) активы Романа Абрамовича на семь миллиардов долларов, сообщал Bloomberg. Это произошло вскоре после того, как власти Евросоюза и Великобритании ввели санкции против бизнесмена из-за полномасштабного вторжения войск России в Украину. Журнал Forbes [оценивает](https://www.forbes.ru/profile/roman-abramovich) состояние Абрамовича в 9,2 миллиарда долларов.

Свои предложения он опубликовал в [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid023LmPDPQUpAEQJtKNy6Ex6Lr6sPS3CorrgwMhZgBcurhmDddjmftJvpJ76urEi7obl&id=100075452118676&locale=ru_RU), сообщает [Orda.kz](orda.kz).** Марат Башимов рассказал, что направил письмо с предложениями генпрокурору Берику Асылову. Депутат хочет не просто вернуть государству выведенные за рубеж деньги, но и провести «расширенную конфискацию». По словам депутата, во многих странах учли рекомендации ФАТФ и внесли соответствующие изменения в законодательство. Раньше принять такие законы было невозможно из-за активного противостояния лоббистов, но сейчас это сделать необходимо, считает Башимов. Казахстан не полностью ратифицировал конвенцию ООН по борьбе с коррупцией, но всё равно является её участником — а это значит, что страна должна бороться с незаконным обогащением не только чиновников, но и членов их семей. > «Сейчас из-за того, что этой нормы нет, и активы переписаны на третьих лиц, многие уходят от ответственности, их имущество не конфискуется в полном объёме, а осуждённый «сидит» спокойно, зная, что у него не забрали то, что переписано на третьих лиц, родственников, любовниц и так далее. И этими активами и деньгами он завтра будет наслаждаться».Марат Башимов Мажилисмен указывает: в законодательстве есть понятие «имущество, приобретённое преступным путем». И оно относится в том числе к имуществу, которым владеют третьи лица. Например, члены семьи, сообщники по уголовным делам, аффилированные юрлица. Сюда же попадают активы, подаренные или за бесценок проданные «на сторону». > «При расширенной конфискации нет необходимости в отдельном судебном разбирательстве и вынесении обвинительного приговора в отношении предшествующей преступной деятельности, в результате которой предположительно были получены активы. Поскольку предполагаемая предшествующая преступная деятельность не нуждается в уточнении. Расширенную конфискацию можно применять лишь в отношении имущества, законность приобретения которого лицо объяснить не может. Механизм предлагается следующий: лицу, в отношении которого начато досудебное производство, предлагается доказать законность приобретения остального имущества. Если он не сможет доказать, то оно подлежит конфискации», — развивает свою мысль депутат. Марат Башимов уточнил, что расширенную конфискацию нужно применять не ко всем подряд — но в первую очередь под неё должны попадать отдельные категории госслужащих и политиков, а также те, кто работает на руководящих постах в госструктурах. Тем временем другие депутаты мажилиса, напротив, предложили [провести амнистию капиталов](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) — и простить казахстанским олигархам вывод денег из страны в обмен на их возвращение в родную экономику. **Читайте также:** * [Возврат активов: почему нельзя просто забрать элитную недвижимость казахстанцев в ОАЭ](https://orda.kz/vozvrat-aktivov-pochemu-nelzja-prosto-zabrat-jelitnuju-nedvizhimost-kazahstancev-v-oaje-399460/) * [Олигархи инвестируют 10,5 млрд долларов в экономику Казахстана](https://orda.kz/oligarhi-investirujut-105-mlrd-dollarov-v-jekonomiku-kazahstana-400481/) * [Понять и простить: казахстанским олигархам разрешат законно вернуть деньги в страну](https://orda.kz/ponjat-i-prostit-kazahstanskim-oligarham-razreshat-zakonno-vernut-dengi-v-stranu-401853/) [возврат активов](/tag/vozvrat-aktivov/) [казахстан](/tag/kazahstan/) [мажилис](/tag/mazhilis/) [марат башимов](/tag/marat-bashimov/) ## Лента новостей * [Токаев встретился с Госсекретарем США Марком Рубио и представителями администрации Дональда Трампа](/tokaev-vstretilsja-s-gossekretarem-ssha-markom-rubio-i-predstaviteljami-administracii-donalda-trampa-408811/) * [Что позволено женщине, то не позволено мужчине?

Dahinter verbarg sich einer der meistgesuchten Drogenbosse Europas. Nun stand eine der Frauen in Zürich vor Gericht. ![René Laglstorfer](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/3tw5IWneaKo8BIJbXh_YFL.jpg) ![Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/BLeGt9CK4FP9PcnTeZSeEt.jpg \"Die Treuhänderin Aida P. vor dem Zürcher Bezirksgericht\") Der Albtraum begann in den Ferien mit einem Anruf ihrer Enkelin im Juli 2022. «Fedpol und Kantonspolizei durchsuchen gerade dein Haus», sagte die junge Frau zu ihrer Grossmutter. «Ich bin komplett durch den Wind gewesen und habe gedacht: Spinnen die?», schildert die 63-Jährige. Die Frau ist langjährige Beizerin am Bodensee. 2013 hatte sie eine Firma gegründet, um in einer thurgauischen Seegemeinde ein Hotel zu bauen. Doch Investoren blieben aus, im November 2020 wollte die Beizerin die Firma wieder loswerden. «Ich habe meiner Treuhänderin Aida P. (Name geändert) eine Vollmacht gegeben, die Firma zu verkaufen, aber ich wusste nicht, an wen», sagt die Wirtin dieser Redaktion. Zurück aus den Ferien wurde die Frau zwei Stunden lang einvernommen. Polizisten hätten viele Fragen gestellt und ihr zig Blätter mit Namen darauf gezeigt, von denen sie niemanden gekannt habe. «Ich finde es verrückt, wie leicht man in so was hineingeraten kann», sagt die Beizerin. ## Dolder, Baur au Lac und Rüschlikon Rund fünf Monate vor dem scheinbar unbedeutenden Firmenverkauf waren der damals 33-jährige «Artur Gitta» und die 26-jährige «Simone Jung» als Touristen in die Schweiz eingereist. Für mehr als 75’000 Franken und mit gefälschten Reisepässen checkte das deutsche Paar im Juni 2020 für einen Monat im Zürcher Luxushotel Dolder ein. Es folgten zwei Wochen im Baur au Lac für rund 22’000 Franken, bis das offenbar wohlhabende Paar in einer Villa am See in Rüschlikon für monatlich 18’000 Franken eine feste Bleibe fand. ![Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/7U7oS4JR4Dc9sHOL49V5wV.jpg \"Bilder des ehemaligen Hauses des belgischen Kokain-Königs Flor Bressers 05.07.23\") Damit endete die jahrelange Flucht rund um den Globus von einem der meistgesuchten Kriminellen Europas: Denn hinter dem Namen «Artur Gitta» verbirgt sich der belgische Kokainkönig Flor Bressers, dessen Drogenkartell tonnenweise Rauschgift nach Europa geschmuggelt haben soll. «Simone Jung» wiederum ist die gefälschte Identität seiner holländischen Lebensgefährtin [Philomina Veenstra](/freundin-von-kokainkoenig-sass-monatelang-mit-baby-in-zuercher-gefaengnis-134865075326) (Name geändert). ## Familiengründung in der Schweiz 20 Monate lang, bis zu seiner [spektakulären Verhaftung](/belgischer-topverbrecher-von-zuercher-spezialeinheit-verhaftet-276783770429) im Februar 2022 in einer Luxuswohnung im Zürcher Renaissance-Tower, sollte Flor Bressers einen sicheren Hafen in der Schweiz haben. Von hier aus konnte der Kokainkönig unbehelligt sein internationales Drogenkartell lenken. So sicher muss er sich gefühlt haben, dass er in dieser Zeit mit seiner Freundin eine Familie gründete – ein Sohn kam in der Schweiz zur Welt. Das Paar führte ein Leben in Saus und Braus mit [Ausgaben in Millionenhöhe,](/das-unglaubliche-luxusleben-des-belgischen-kokainkoenigs-am-zuerichsee-184889075678) wie diese Redaktion zuerst berichtete. ## Flor Bressers findet einen Job Möglich gemacht haben das Luxusleben, finanziert aus dem internationalen Drogenhandel, am Zürichsee zahlreiche Helfer. Doch nicht alle dürften gewusst haben, wer sich hinter «Gitta» wirklich verbarg, wie Recherchen zeigen. ![Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/2gwpU9f1qKaA7utZtF82KO.jpg \"Blick über den Bodensee, an den Flor Bressers seine geschäftlichen Aktivitäten und seinen offiziellen Wohnsitz verlegte, während er in Wirklichkeit am Zürichsee wohnte.\") Eine dieser Helferinnen ist die eingangs erwähnte Treuhänderin Aida P., die sich am Donnerstag wegen schwerer Geldwäscherei, Begünstigung und Täuschung der Behörden vor dem Bezirksgericht Zürich verantworten muss. Die Thurgauerin konnte den sichtlich wohlhabenden «Artur Gitta» spätestens Ende August 2020 – wenige Monate nach dessen Ankunft in der Schweiz – zu ihrem Kundenkreis zählen. ## «Anschein eines rechtschaffenen Bürgers» Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Aida P. vor, nicht nur einen Wohnsitz für «Gitta» und dessen Familie an der Zürcher Goldküste für einen maximalen Mietbetrag von monatlich 25’000 Franken gesucht zu haben. Die 36-Jährige soll ihm bereits Ende August zum Schein einen Arbeitsvertrag als Mitarbeiter in ihrem Treuhandbüro ausgestellt haben. «Die Idee war, unseren Kundenstamm über sein Netzwerk zu erweitern. Er wollte Neukunden bringen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. Als Wohnort gab sie dessen Adresse in einem Wohnblock im thurgauischen Amriswil an, wo er jedoch laut den Ermittlern nie gewohnt hat. ![Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/EdaEx7mbKe29b_TumnzYuR.jpg \"Sonnenuntergang über Amriswil – Flor Bressers wählte die thurgauische Gemeinde als offiziellen Wohnsitz aus.\") Gestützt auf diese Angaben, stellte das Migrationsamt Thurgau dem angeblichen Artur Gitta eine B-Aufenthaltsbewilligung aus. «Mit ihrem Verhalten und ihren Tätigkeiten erweckte die Beschuldigte den Anschein, dass es sich bei Artur Gitta (Flor Bressers) um einen rechtschaffenen Bürger handelte», heisst es in der Anklageschrift. Auch soll Aida P. «Gitta» dabei unterstützt haben, dass er bei Behörden nie selber oder mit seinen echten Personalien auftreten musste. Damit habe sie ihm «wissentlich oder willentlich geholfen», seine wahre Identität zu verschleiern und ihn dem Zugriff der Strafverfolgungsbehörden zu entziehen. ## Der Finanzchef und der Concierge Als schwerster Vorwurf wiegt jedoch, dass die 36-jährige Treuhänderin Gelder aus dem Kokainhandel gewaschen haben soll, indem sie diese entgegennahm und in der Schweiz investierte. Der direkte Gewinn für die Treuhänderin betrug dabei laut Anklageschrift 51’000 Franken, wobei aus einem Bauprojekt am Bodensee weitere 100’000 Franken erwartet wurden. Ab September 2020 erhielten Aida P. und ihre 34-jährige Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. (Name geändert) über Geldkuriere nachweislich insgesamt 320’000 Franken Bargeld von drei Männern: «Gitta», dessen damals ebenso im Kanton Zürich lebenden Finanzchef Bastiaan K. und einem ergebenen [privaten Concierge](/concierge-ermoeglichte-luxusleben-wie-sich-der-kokainkoenig-in-zuerich-versteckte-847540903985). ## Wusste die Treuhänderin, wer Artur Gitta wirklich ist? 190’000 Franken davon seien in zwei Tranchen jeweils in einer Schuhschachtel in Aida P.s Treuhandbüro am Bodensee übergeben worden. Das Geld war vorgesehen, um die unverdächtige Firma der eingangs erwähnten Beizerin zu kaufen. Die Kauf- und Vertragsverhandlungen dafür führte Aida P. laut Staatsanwaltschaft im Namen von «Gitta». 190’000 Franken Bargeld gingen an die Beizerin. Vor Gericht sagt die Treuhänderin: «Wir haben seinen Ausweis überprüft, aber nicht sein Geld.» Auch für zwei Banken sei Artur Gitta «sauber» gewesen. Nach der Übernahme wurde die Firma in «Gitta Suisse AG» umbenannt und residierte an der derselben Adresse am Bodensee wie das Treuhandbüro. Dies sollte Flor Bressers den Anschein eines gewöhnlichen Unternehmers verleihen mit offiziellem Wohn- und Arbeitsort im ländlichen Thurgau. ![Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. ](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/9qlyQJe14XOAq3ua2_2vsd.jpg \"Blick auf den Bodensee im thurgauischen Münsterlingen. \") Mit Geld vom Konto seiner unscheinbaren Firma kaufte die Treuhänderin im Februar 2021 zehn Kilo Silberbarren im Schätzwert von 6800 Franken und verwahrte sie im Bankschliessfach ihres Büros. ## Die verzweigten Geldflüsse der Treuhänderinnen Die verbleibenden etwa 130’000 Franken Bargeld zahlten Aida P. und ihre Geschäftspartnerin Giulia S. in vier- bis fünfstelligen Beträgen zunächst auf ihre Privatkonten ein. Von dort überwiesen die beiden Frauen das Geld laut Anklageschrift unter Angabe falscher Gründe, etwa «Rückzahlung Kleinkredit», auf das Firmenkonto ihres Treuhandbüros. Von diesem und einem weiteren Firmenkonto der Gitta Suisse AG überwies Aida P. zwischen September 2020 und November 2021 elf «fingierte Gehaltszahlungen» an Artur Gitta über jeweils 4500 Franken – insgesamt rund 50’000 Franken. Doch laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat «Gitta» nie für das Treuhandbüro am Bodensee gearbeitet. «Man hätte es vermuten können, wer er in Wahrheit ist, aber ich habe es nicht vermutet. Ich bin zu wenig vorsichtig gewesen», sagt Aida P. vor Gericht. ## Falsche Angaben bei Behörden Im Juni und Juli 2021 soll die beschuldigte Treuhänderin bei den Steuer- und Einwohnerbehörden der Stadt Amriswil unwahre Angaben über den tatsächlichen Wohnort des Kokainkönigs gemacht haben. Zur selben Zeit überwies Aida P. 70’000 Franken auf ihr Privatkonto, um damit bei einem Luxusgeschäft im Zürcher Kreis 4 eine exklusive Stereoanlage für «Gitta» zu kaufen. Dieser gab mit seiner Lebensgefährtin im selben Laden weitere 64’000 Franken aus. Für Schmuck waren es 667’000 Franken und für Wein 400’000 Franken – über 2,5 Millionen Franken in etwa 20 Monaten. ## Finanzchef wird am Basler Flughafen verhaftet Im Oktober 2021 musste «Gitta» einen schweren Rückschlag verdauen: Sein engster Vertrauter, der erwähnte Finanzchef Bastiaan K., wurde am Flughafen Basel-Mulhouse verhaftet und später nach Belgien ausgeliefert. Dasselbe Schicksal ereilte den als Flor Bressers enttarnten «Gitta» vier Monate später. Beide mutmasslichen Schwerkriminellen warten seither mit 33 weiteren Beschuldigten auf ihren Prozess in Belgien, wie diese Redaktion aus Justizkreisen erfahren hat. Bei einer Verurteilung drohen beiden lange Gefängnisstrafen. ## «Die Alarmglocken müssen schrillen» Weit glimpflicher kommen die beiden Treuhänderinnen dank Geständnissen und eines Deals mit der Staatsanwaltschaft davon. Giulia S. erhielt einen rechtskräftigen Strafbefehl mit einer bedingten Geldstrafe von 180 Tagessätzen à 90 Franken und einer Geldbusse von 3900 Franken. Zudem muss sie 80’000 Franken als Ersatzforderung an den Staat zahlen. ![Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)](https://cdn.unitycms.io/images/6dudW4BXquo9FvO50rGpti.jpg \"Themenbiild: Berzirksgericht Zürich an der Badenerstrasse 90. Aussenansicht. 24.11.2016 (Tages-Anzeiger/Urs Jaudas)\") Am Ende erkennt Aida P. sämtliche Vorwürfe an. Die Richter verurteilten sie zu einer bedingten Freiheitsstrafe von zwölf Monaten sowie zu eine bedingten Geldstrafe von 90 Tagessätzen à 110 Franken – insgesamt 9900 Franken. Ausserdem muss sie 120’000 Franken mutmassliche Drogengelder an den Staat zahlen. «Wenn man soviel Bargeld erhält, müssen im Kopf die Alarmglocken schrillen. Das war bei Ihnen nicht der Fall», sagte der Richter zum Schluss. Das Urteil ist nicht rechtskräftig.

Aida P. allegedly helped Bressers conceal his true identity by providing a false identity (\"Artur Gitta\"), securing a Swiss residence permit under false pretenses, and issuing a sham employment contract to create the appearance of a legitimate citizen. She is accused of knowingly facilitating money laundering by receiving and investing drug proceeds in Switzerland, including handling at least CHF 320,000 in cash delivered by money couriers connected to Bressers and his associates. Part of these funds (CHF 190,000) were used to purchase a local company under Bressers’ control, with Aida P. conducting negotiations on his behalf. The treuhänderin reportedly profited directly by CHF 51,000, with further gains expected.

       " 'hyde_list': ['**Lukoil Under Scrutiny: Potential Money Laundering Risks and Regulatory Implications**\\n\\nRecent investigative reports have brought to light allegations of money laundering activities linked to Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil companies. From a regulatory compliance standpoint, these developments warrant a thorough examination of the company’s adherence to international anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks and sanctions regimes, particularly given the heightened geopolitical tensions and stringent enforcement environments.\\n\\nThe primary concern centers on whether Lukoil’s financial transactions have circumvented key provisions under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, which constitute the global standard for AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Specifically, FATF Recommendation 10 mandates robust customer due diligence (CDD) and ongoing monitoring to detect and prevent illicit financial flows. If Lukoil engaged in structuring payments or layering transactions to obscure the origin of funds, this would constitute a breach of these protocols.\\n\\nMoreover, given the current sanctions imposed by the United States under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the European Union’s restrictive measures targeting Russian entities, any facilitation of sanctioned transactions by Lukoil could result in significant penalties. OFAC’s enforcement actions have historically included hefty fines and restrictions on correspondent banking relationships for entities found complicit in evading sanctions. Compliance officers should note that secondary sanctions risks also arise if third-party financial institutions inadvertently process illicit payments linked to Lukoil.\\n\\nIn addition to AML and sanctions compliance, the European Union’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD), which criminalizes money laundering as a standalone offense and extends liability to legal persons, may provide a legal basis for prosecution within EU jurisdictions.\\n\\nFor compliance teams and legal counsel, this situation underscores the critical importance of enhanced transaction monitoring, rigorous vendor and counterparty screening, and real-time sanctions screening protocols. Failure to implement these controls not only jeopardizes regulatory standing but also exposes financial institutions to reputational damage and operational disruptions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil money laundering allegations highlight a complex intersection of AML and sanctions compliance risks. Vigilance and proactive regulatory adherence remain paramount to mitigating exposure in this evolving landscape.',\n",
       "  '**Unveiling the Veil: Forensic Financial Analysis Exposes Lukoil’s Money Laundering Scheme**\\n\\nBy [Journalist Name]\\n\\nIn an intricate web of cross-border transactions and shell entities, Lukoil, Russia’s oil giant, stands accused of orchestrating a sophisticated money laundering operation designed to obscure illicit proceeds and shield them from regulatory scrutiny. My forensic financial investigation, grounded in meticulous transaction pattern analysis and accounting record scrutiny, reveals alarming irregularities that pose significant reputational and regulatory risks to associated financial institutions.\\n\\nThe scheme’s architecture hinges on a multi-layered layering process, wherein Lukoil funneled revenues through a network of offshore subsidiaries registered in low-transparency jurisdictions. Transaction flow analysis exposes a recurrent pattern: large-volume transfers denominated in multiple currencies rapidly cycling through a series of accounts with minimal economic rationale. These “round-tripping” transactions artificially inflate trading volumes and generate misleading audit trails, complicating the detection of true cash origins.\\n\\nFurthermore, anomalous invoice patterns emerged—contracts with inflated values and vague service descriptions—suggesting the use of trade-based money laundering techniques. These invoices served as a façade to legitimize the flow of funds, masking proceeds from potentially corrupt procurement deals or kickbacks. The financial statements reflect disproportionate growth in intangible assets and intercompany receivables, inconsistent with operational performance metrics, signaling potential asset misclassification to conceal illicit gains.\\n\\nCritical to this forensic inquiry is the identification of “layering nodes,” accounts exhibiting high-frequency, low-value transactions designed to fragment money flows and evade threshold-based monitoring systems. These nodes correlate strongly with entities flagged in international sanctions lists, indicating possible circumvention of compliance controls.\\n\\nFor risk managers and auditors, this case underscores the imperative of integrating advanced forensic analytics into due diligence protocols. Reliance on traditional financial reporting obscures the complex laundering mechanisms employed by conglomerates like Lukoil. Enhanced scrutiny of transaction patterns, combined with cross-jurisdictional data sharing, is essential to preempt reputational damage and uphold the integrity of the global financial system.',\n",
       "  '**Lukoil and the Imperative of Strengthened Operational Controls Amid Money Laundering Allegations**\\n\\nRecent allegations implicating Lukoil in money laundering activities underscore critical vulnerabilities in corporate governance and internal control frameworks that demand urgent attention from operational risk professionals. As one of Russia’s largest oil companies, Lukoil’s exposure to complex financial transactions and cross-border dealings inherently increases its susceptibility to illicit financial flows, necessitating robust operational safeguards.\\n\\nFrom an operational risk assessment standpoint, the reported money laundering activities reveal potential lapses in Lukoil’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls and compliance monitoring systems. Effective AML frameworks require comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, transaction monitoring, and timely reporting mechanisms. The emergence of suspicious transactions linked to Lukoil suggests deficiencies in these core processes, possibly exacerbated by inadequate segregation of duties and insufficient oversight at governance levels.\\n\\nMoreover, the governance structures overseeing Lukoil’s financial operations warrant scrutiny. Operational risk teams must evaluate whether the board and senior management have established a risk-aware culture that prioritizes transparency and accountability. The presence of systemic risks—such as collusion among employees or external intermediaries—can significantly impair the integrity of financial reporting and expose the institution to regulatory sanctions and reputational damage.\\n\\nTo mitigate such risks, operational risk functions should advocate for enhanced internal audit cycles focusing on AML compliance, reinforced training programs for staff on fraud detection, and integration of advanced analytics to identify anomalous patterns. Additionally, strengthening whistleblower protections can empower employees to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil case serves as a cautionary tale emphasizing the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls and governance mechanisms. Operational risk professionals must leverage this incident to reassess and fortify their AML frameworks, ensuring resilience against financial crimes that threaten organizational stability and market integrity.',\n",
       "  '**Lukoil and the Shadow of Money Laundering: Assessing Reputational Risks in a High-Stakes Partnership**\\n\\nIn recent months, Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil producers, has found itself entangled in allegations of money laundering—an issue that reverberates far beyond legal boundaries into the realm of reputational risk. For financial institutions considering partnerships or transactional relationships with Lukoil, understanding the nuanced media landscape and public sentiment is critical to safeguarding brand integrity.\\n\\nMedia outlets across Europe and North America have reported extensively on investigations linking Lukoil executives to complex laundering schemes designed to obscure illicit proceeds. These reports often highlight the use of shell companies and offshore accounts, underscoring the sophisticated nature of the alleged operations. Importantly, the narrative is not confined to isolated accusations but is framed within a broader context of systemic corruption in the energy sector, amplifying concerns among stakeholders.\\n\\nPublic perception, as gauged through social media discourse and analyst commentary, reveals a growing skepticism toward institutions associated with Lukoil. Environmental activists and anti-corruption watchdogs have seized on these allegations to call for heightened scrutiny and divestment, placing additional pressure on banks and financial partners. The reputational fallout is palpable: associations with entities accused of money laundering risk eroding public trust and invite regulatory scrutiny that can disrupt business continuity.\\n\\nFor communications and public relations professionals, the imperative is clear. Engaging with Lukoil in any capacity demands rigorous due diligence and transparent communication strategies that address stakeholder concerns head-on. Failure to do so risks not only legal exposure but also the erosion of brand equity in an era where reputational capital is as valuable as financial assets.\\n\\nIn sum, the Lukoil money laundering allegations serve as a cautionary tale. They underscore the intricate interplay between criminal investigations, media framing, and public perception—an interplay that must be carefully navigated to protect institutional reputations in an increasingly vigilant global marketplace.',\n",
       "  '**Assessing Lukoil’s Exposure to Money Laundering Risks: A KYC/AML Compliance Perspective**\\n\\nRecent allegations linking Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil companies, to potential money laundering activities underscore critical vulnerabilities in corporate KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) frameworks within the energy sector. From a compliance standpoint, these developments warrant a rigorous examination of Lukoil’s customer identification procedures, beneficial ownership transparency, and transaction monitoring controls.\\n\\nAt the core of effective AML compliance is robust customer due diligence (CDD). For an entity of Lukoil’s scale, this entails comprehensive verification of counterparties, including end-users and intermediaries involved in oil trading and financing arrangements. Deficiencies in identifying ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) can create opacity, facilitating illicit actors to exploit complex ownership structures for layering illicit proceeds. Reports suggest that opaque offshore entities and shell companies may have been leveraged to obscure the origin and destination of funds, a classic red flag in money laundering typologies.\\n\\nMoreover, transaction monitoring systems must be calibrated to detect atypical patterns consistent with trade-based money laundering (TBML), such as over- or under-invoicing of oil shipments, circular trading, or rapid movement of funds through high-risk jurisdictions. The absence of dynamic risk-based controls and real-time analytics can delay the detection of suspicious activities, increasing regulatory and reputational risks.\\n\\nFrom a regulatory compliance perspective, Lukoil’s AML program should align with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, including enhanced due diligence (EDD) for politically exposed persons (PEPs) and entities operating in high-risk countries. Failure to implement such standards not only contravenes international norms but also exposes the company to sanctions and enforcement actions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Lukoil case exemplifies the imperative for energy companies to strengthen KYC/AML controls, ensuring transparency and mitigating the risk of facilitating money laundering. Compliance officers should prioritize continuous enhancement of beneficial ownership disclosures and deploy sophisticated transaction monitoring tools to safeguard against illicit financial flows.'],\n",
