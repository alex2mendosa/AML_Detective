None of these cases are founded on monetary claims against Danube SRL or the company’s ability to manage its day-to-day business affairs, but revolve around a personal claim of Bemol Retail SRL, a third party, on a former general manager of Bemol.\\n\\n[![Image 9: Footer Logo Alternative Text](https://www.ebrd.com/content/dam/ebrd_dxp/background-images/ebrd-regular.svg)](https://www.ebrd.com/home.html)\\n\\n[Engage with us](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2023/ebrd-will-appeal-imposed-external-administration-of-assets-of-moldovas-danube-logistics-srl.html \"Engage with us\")\\n\\n*   [Comment on proposals](https://www.ebrd.com/home/comment-on-proposal.html \"visit page about ebrd proposals and opportunity to comment\")\\n*   [Report fraud, corruption and misconduct](https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/strategies-governance-compliance/office-chief-compliance-officer/report-fraud-corruption-prohibited-practices.html \"visit page about reporting fraud and corruption\")\\n*   [Submit environmental or social complaint](https://www.ebrd.com/home/what-we-do/projects/independent-project-accountability-mechanism.html \"visit ebrd project accountability page\")\\n\\n[Contact us](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts.html \"visit page about contacting the EBRD\")\\n\\n*   [Request for information](https://www.ebrd.com/home/forms/information-request.html \"visit form for requesting information about ebrd\")\\n*   [A-Z contacts list](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts/ebrd-contacts-list.html \"visit page of full A-Z contacts for the ebrd\")\\n*   [Media enquiries](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts/ebrd-media-enquiries.html \"visit page about media enquiries\")\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   [Cookie Policy](https://www.ebrd.com/home/cookie-policy.html \"click to view information on website cookie policy\")\\n*   [Site map](https://www.ebrd.com/home/site-map.html \"click to view ebrd sitemap\")\\n*   [Terms and conditions](https://www.ebrd.com/home/terms-and-conditions.html \"click to view terms and conditions of website\")\\n*   [Access to Information Policy](https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/strategies-governance-compliance/access-to-information-policy.html \"visit page about ebrd access to information policy\")\\n\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/ebrdhq \"Visit EBRD page on Facebook (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://x.com/ebrd \"Visit EBRD page on X (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/ebrd_official/ \"Visit EBRD page on Instagram (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/ebrdtv \"Visit EBRD page on YouTube (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ebrd/ \"Visit EBRD page on Linkedin (opens in new window)\")\\n\\nCookie consent\\n\\nCookies are pieces of code used to track website usage and give audiences the best possible experience.

    "IMPORTANT\n",
    "- Do NOT re-classify. Use each item's `claim_type` as ground truth.\n",
    "- Do NOT invent facts or fields. Use only what is present in the summaries.\n",
    "- Return ONLY the structured object matching `ClaimsFromSummaries` (no extra text).\n",
    "\n",
    "INPUT (per item): url, source, summary, claim_type, date_published, hyde_score\n",
    "\n",
    "SCOPE & FILTERS\n",
    "- Include ONLY items about {state[\"entity_name\"]}. If an item focuses on another company, skip it.\n",
    "- If an affiliate/subsidiary is mentioned, include only if the summary explicitly ties it to {state[\"entity_name\"]} (ownership/control/parent–subsidiary stated). Otherwise skip.\n",
    "- Ignore items that explicitly say there is no information about {state[\"entity_name\"]}.\n",
    "- RAW CONTENT may include boilerplate or unrelated text—ignore noise and use only substantive financial-crime details.\n",

    "DEFINITION — CLUSTER\n",
    "- A **cluster** is a set of items that describe the **same underlying event** and share the same `claim_type`.\n",
    "- “Underlying event” means a single discrete action/outcome (e.g., one fine order, one settlement agreement, one charge/indictment, one conviction/plea, one sanctions listing, one clearance/closure, one investigation opening) concerning {state[\"entity_name\"]}.\n",
    "- Press updates or multiple articles about the **same** order/filing/decision belong to the **same cluster**.\n",
    "- If there is a **material difference** (e.g., different regulator/agency, different amount/currency, different case number or court, clearly different event dates), treat as **separate clusters** even if wording is similar.\n",
    "- Each **cluster maps to exactly one `EvidenceClaim`** (one cluster ⇒ one claim).\n",
    "\n",
    "CONSOLIDATION (NO RE-CLASSIFICATION)\n",
    "1) Form clusters using semantic overlap in:\n",
    "   - regulator/agency/court names\n",
    "   - action (fine/settlement/charge/plea/conviction/investigation/allegation/clearance/sanction_listing)\n",
    "   - amounts & currency (treat “€1.5B” ≈ “€1,500,000,000”)\n",
    "   - timeframe or event date window\n",
    "   - jurisdiction/country/court\n",
    "   When uncertain, prefer merging items with higher `hyde_score`; if still unsure, keep separate claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) For each cluster, output ONE `EvidenceClaim`:\n",
    "   - `claim_text`: One precise sentence for {state[\"entity_name\"]} capturing shared details (amounts, agency, timeframe, jurisdiction). If sources conflict on a detail, omit that detail rather than guessing.\n",
    "   - `claim_type`: COPY from the clustered items (do not change).\n",
    "   - `supporting_urls`: ALL unique URLs from the cluster. Deduplicate. Order by descending `hyde_score`; if scores tie or are missing, preserve first appearance.\n",
    "   - `date_publish`: choose in this order:\n",
    "       a) A clear event date in the summaries (YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
    "       b) Else the most recent non-\"Unknown\" publication date among the clustered items.\n",
    "       c) Else \"Unknown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3) If items refer to the same matter but have DIFFERENT `claim_type` (e.g., investigation → settlement → clearance), output SEPARATE claims (one per type).\n",
    "\n",
    "FORMAT RULES\n",
    "- `date_publish` must be \"YYYY-MM-DD\" or \"Unknown\".\n",
    "- If no valid claims remain after filtering, return `evidence_claims: []`.\n",
    "- Sort `evidence_claims` by `date_publish` ascending; place \"Unknown\" dates last.\n",

    "    KEY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. VIOLATION SEVERITY\n",
    "    - Calculate total fines from the evidence (don't hardcode)\n",
    "    - Identify the scale of violations (amounts involved vs fines paid)\n",
    "    - Determine if violations were systemic or isolated\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. CURRENT RISK STATUS\n",
    "    - Count active investigations (ongoing = unresolved risk)\n",
    "    - Identify investigating authorities \n",
    "    - Assess geographic spread (multiple jurisdictions = higher risk)\n",
    "    - Evaluate timeline and provide quote with date in ISO 8601 format (recent violations = weak current controls)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n",
    "    - Evaluate settlement efforts (genuine improvement vs PR)\n",
    "    - Check for leadership accountability (executives resigned?)\n",
    "    - Assess system improvements (new AML systems, training?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. PATTERN RECOGNITION\n",
    "    - Multiple fines for similar issues = poor compliance culture\n",
    "    - Repeated violations across years = systemic failure\n",

Danske Bank faced multiple regulatory investigations, criminal charges in Denmark and other jurisdictions, and paid hundreds of millions in fines. In December 2022, Danske Bank agreed to forfeit $2 billion as part of a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC for defrauding U.S. banks and violating AML laws.

       "  AIMessage(content='**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\\n\\nDanske Bank has been implicated in one of the largest money laundering scandals in European history, with over €200 billion in suspicious funds processed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The bank has admitted guilt, faced criminal convictions, and paid fines totaling over €2.5 billion across multiple jurisdictions, including the US, Denmark, France, and Estonia. The violations were systemic, spanning nearly a decade, and involved failures in AML controls, client due diligence, and transaction monitoring. While major settlements have been reached and executive resignations have occurred, ongoing investigations and recent fines indicate that the risk is not fully resolved.\\n\\n**Total Fines Paid Calculation:**\\n- €470 million (2024-11-18)\\n- $2 million (2025-08-29) ≈ €1.85 million (at $1 = €0.925)\\n- Over $2 billion (2025-06-20) ≈ €1.85 billion\\n- €6,028,799 + €300,000 = €6.33 million (2025-05-27)\\n- $50 million (2025-10-08) ≈ €46.25 million\\n- €6.3 million (2024-09-18) [French settlement]\\n- Additional fines referenced but not quantified (hundreds of millions, billion-dollar fine, etc.)\\n\\n**Total (rounded, using largest confirmed numbers and avoiding double-counting):**\\n- €470 million + €1.85 billion + €6.33 million + €1.85 million + €46.25 million + €6.3 million = **€2,380,730,000** (approx. €2.38 billion)\\n\\n**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\\n\\n- **Nature:** Systemic money laundering through Estonian branch (2007–2015), with €200+ billion in suspicious transactions, mainly from Russian clients.\\n- **Criminal Conviction:** Admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud (2024-07-11).\\n- **Regulatory Failures:** Inadequate AML controls, poor client due diligence, and failure to act on warnings (e.g., from Central Bank of Russia in 2013).\\n- **Leadership Accountability:** CEO and key executives resigned; Estonian branch closed in 2019.\\n- **Jurisdictions:** Denmark, Estonia, US, UK, France, and broader EU.\\n\\n**3. CURRENT STATUS**\\n\\n- **Resolved:** Major settlements with US, Danish, and French authorities; Estonian branch closed; executive resignations.\\n- **Ongoing:** Investigations by Danish, Estonian, US, and UK authorities (as of 2025-06-20); recent fines (2025-08-29, 2025-10-08) indicate continued regulatory scrutiny.\\n- **Geographic Spread:** Multi-jurisdictional (EU, US, Russia, Baltics).\\n- **Recent Activity:** Fines and settlements as recent as October 2025.\\n\\n**4.

[Lucinity](/blog/author/lucinity) 5 min With illicit financial flows becoming increasingly complex, combating money laundering is a major challenge for the financial sector. [Global estimates suggest that 2-5% of the world\\'s GDP is laundered annually](https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas/economic-crime/money-laundering?ref=lucinity.ghost.io), shedding light on the severe need for more effective compliance solutions. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in, fundamentally changing how businesses tackle anti-money laundering (AML) compliance problems. This blog covers AI\\'s indispensable role in enhancing AML compliance, showcasing its potential to significantly improve detection and operational efficiency, thus offering a robust defense against financial crimes. ## **Importance of Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is essential to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the financial system. [Effective AML practices prevent the financial market from becoming a playground for illicit activities](https://lucinity.com/blog/the-framl-model?ref=lucinity.ghost.io), such as drug trafficking, terrorism financing, and other serious crimes. Enforcing robust AML measures allows financial institutions to comply with legal mandates. Additionally, it helps safeguard their reputation, sustain customer trust, and plays a significant role in maintaining global economic stability. The urgency for stringent [anti-money laundering](https://lucinity.com/blog/fintech-anti-money-laundering-tips?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) compliance has escalated as financial systems become more interconnected globally, providing greater opportunities for sophisticated criminal networks to exploit vulnerabilities. The laundering of money poses a severe threat to the financial world, influencing everything from market volatility to international relations. Strengthening anti-money laundering compliance helps counter this threat by safeguarding the financial sector against various risks. It also contributes to establishing a secure and stable economic environment worldwide. However, money laundering techniques continue to adapt and grow, and AML regulations are getting increasingly complicated in response. This creates multiple compliance challenges for businesses. ## **Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Challenges** [AML compliance](https://lucinity.com/blog/aml-compliance-what-you-should-know?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) challenges are a major concern for financial institutions, as they face several obstacles in maintaining a robust anti-money laundering program. Here are some common AML compliance hurdles- * **Data Volume and Complexity**- The sheer amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed for AML purposes can be overwhelming. Traditional tools, often manual and data-intensive, lack the efficiency and effectiveness to cope with the intricacies of modern financial crimes. * **Evolving Criminal Tactics**- Money launderers continually adapt, using sophisticated methods to evade detection. This necessitates a dynamic and equally sophisticated response from AML systems, a task that often overwhelms conventional compliance mechanisms. * **Integration with Legacy Systems**- [Many financial institutions operate on legacy systems that are not readily compatible with advanced AI solutions.](https://lucinity.com/blog/saas-vs-legacy?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) This brings us to the challenge of integrating new technologies without disrupting existing operations. * **False Positives**- Striking the right balance to reduce false positives without missing genuine suspicious activities is a major challenge in AML compliance programs, especially while using traditional systems. These AML compliance challenges are ubiquitous, and there’s a pressing need for innovative solutions capable of addressing these multifaceted issues. This is where AI is instrumental. Let’s learn about advanced AML compliance solutions and how they leverage AI to help you handle these challenges and ensure efficient AML compliance. ## **The Role of AI in Anti-money Laundering Compliance** Here’s how [Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing anti-money laundering compliance solutions](https://lucinity.com/blog/from-solo-to-copilot?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) to directly address AML challenges and apply best practices proactively- * **Advanced Detection and Analysis**- AI algorithms excel at sifting through vast datasets quickly, identifying suspicious patterns that might elude human analysts. The advanced suspicious transaction detection and analysis of AI algorithms help pinpoint potential money laundering activities hidden within complex financial transactions with ease. * **Predictive Analytics**- AI\\'s predictive capabilities allow financial institutions to foresee and mitigate potential AML risks before they escalate. By analyzing historical data and current trends, AI can forecast future money laundering schemes, enabling proactive rather than reactive measures. * **Operational Efficiency**- AI streamlines AML processes by automating routine tasks like data collection, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity report generation. Speeding up the compliance process, AI also frees up valuable resources to focus on more strategic, high-level analysis. * **Reducing False Positives**- A major benefit of integrating AI in anti-money laundering compliance is its ability to minimize false positives, which are costly and time-consuming. AI\\'s precision in differentiating between legitimate and suspicious activities helps fine-tune the alert system, ensuring that compliance teams concentrate on genuine threats. * **Continuous Improvement and Learning**- AI systems, particularly those employing machine learning, evolve and improve over time. They adapt to new money laundering tactics, ensuring that AML policies and procedures remain effective against the constantly evolving threats. * **Integration and Scalability**- AI can be integrated with existing systems, enhancing their capabilities without necessitating a complete overhaul. Its scalability means that it can handle increasing volumes of transactions and data, which is essential for growing financial institutions. With these advantages, AI fortifies the anti-money laundering compliance framework and also ensures it is adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. ## **Case Studies: AI in Action for AML** We will now consider real-life examples to better interpret the practical application of AI in enhancing Anti-Money Laundering compliance: * [**Danske Bank**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/achieving-real-business/9781492038214/ch06.html?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- Facing challenges with its existing AML processes, Danske Bank adopted an AI-powered system that analyzed customer data and transaction patterns in real time. This shift resulted in a 60% reduction in false positives, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of its AML program. * [**HSBC**](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/hsbc-deploys-industry-first-automated-aml-system/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- By implementing an AI-driven system for AML, HSBC managed to automate its compliance processes, leading to a more streamlined operation and effective customer due diligence. The technology helped the bank reduce the time spent on AML reviews and save approximately $400,000 annually, demonstrating considerable cost-effectiveness. * [**Standard Chartered**](https://loopline.org.uk/navigating-card-fees-in-retail-a-guide-to-interchange-fees-and-maximising-savings/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- This bank implemented AI to automate its AML processes, analyzing data and transaction patterns effectively. The result was a 40% reduction in compliance review time, showcasing the efficiency gains achievable with AI integration. * [**JPMorgan Chase**](https://www.thestack.technology/transaction-monitoring-banking/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- In an effort to enhance its AML initiatives, JPMorgan Chase implemented AI and achieved a remarkable 95% reduction in false positives.

However, it can also be exploited by criminals for severe crimes like human trafficking and terrorism. Danske Bank is dedicated to fighting financial crime and we have completed a groupwide financial crime enhancement programme, investing in systems and controls to protect the bank and its customers. Continuing to develop and improve our efforts to preserve the integrity of our business and uphold our societal responsibility is a key priority for us. ## How we fight financial crime ### We adhere to Finance Denmark\\'s principles At Danske Bank, we adhere to the principles developed by Finance Denmark’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Taskforce in which we participated, to prevent and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. These principles are reflected in our approach. * #### We always prioritise ethics over profit * #### We comply with the spirit and the letter of the law * #### We welcome oversight * #### We have a targeted corporate culture commitment * #### We assume managerial responsibility and ensure that all staff take responsibility for AML/CTF efforts * #### We have constructive partnerships with all stakeholders, including the authorities ### We focus on people, partnerships and processes * ### ### We ensure that we have the right PEOPLE and competencies in place to fight financial crime. ### Key initiatives + #### Fighting financial crime is a top priority We have governance structures in place to ensure escalation of compliance matters when required. Our Chief Compliance Officer is a member of our Executive Leadership Team, ensuring that compliance and the fight against financial crime is an integrated part of how we do business. Financial crime prevention is part of our organisational DNA and we nurture a shared mind-set, where employees are mindful of doing the right kind of business with the right customers in the right way. + #### Mandatory fighting financial crime training All employees are required to complete mandatory training in fighting financial crime every year. We also provide targeted financial crime prevention training to employees throughout the organisation, ranging from senior management to frontline advisors. This specialised training considers different learning objectives that are specific to certain roles and includes feedback loops to ensure that we are learning from the past. + #### An essential part of our business We have experienced financial crime prevention specialists in our organisation, and we maintain strong competencies across our three lines of defence. * ### ### We engage proactively with authorities and industry colleagues in PARTNERSHIPS to fight financial crime together. **### Key initiatives** + #### Supporting a stronger industry framework Danske Bank contributes expertise and policy recommendations to create a more efficient and effective industry framework for preventing money laundering and countering terrorist financing. + #### Participation in public-private partnerships Danske Bank actively engages in initiatives to collectively fight financial crime by increasing cooperation between the financial sector and authorities. The collaboration facilitates the detection of criminal methods, criminal individuals and criminal networks. Furthermore, the public-private partnerships enable more and better collaboration and greater knowledge sharing among all participants and parties involved in societal initiatives against money laundering and terrorist financing. Some examples of this work are our participation in the Operational Danish Intelligence Network (ODIN), the Swedish Anti Money Laundering Initiative (SAMLIT) and the Finnish Anti Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FAMLIT). + #### Joint efforts against cybercrime Danske Bank collaborates with external cyber security organisations to help strengthen cyber resilience in the Nordic countries. In addition, we also provide advice and tools for our customers that enable them to protect themselves against cyber criminals and payment fraud, such as investment scams, romance scams, crypto-currency scams, and ID theft. To raise awareness of fraud trends, we also collaborate with the Danish Consumer Council on their free self-defence app, [Mit digitale forsvar](https://taenk.dk/om-os/apps-fra-forbrugerraadet-taenk/app-mit-digitale-selvforsvar) * ### ### We continually develop our PROCESSES, controls, and systems to maintain our ability to effectively prevent financial crimes. ### Key initiatives + #### Customer on-boarding and data quality As a bank, we are required by law to review our customers to better understand who they are, why they want to become customers of Danske Bank, and how they intend to use our services. We use digital platforms and tools to optimise our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data collection and ensure the quality of existing KYC data, allowing us to validate the data quickly and making it easy to become a customer of Danske Bank. + #### International money transfers We require complete information about the payer and recipient of international payments. This means that several items of information about the payer and recipient must follow the transaction throughout the payment process. The purpose of these requirements is to prevent, investigate and trace money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to ensure that international payments are secure. + #### Transaction monitoring systems Monitoring and screening of customers and their transactions are a vital part of Danske Bank\\'s financial crime defence. We undertake automated monitoring and surveillance of transactions and communications by utilising technologies to optimise the process and target relevant risks, and we continue to ensure that our systems are fit to identify potentially unusual patterns. + #### Investigation and reporting At Danske Bank, we pursue investigation efficiency and effectiveness to ensure that any suspicion of financial crime is reported to the relevant authorities for further investigation. We continue to ensure that the speed and coverage of our investigations are fit to identify potential financial crime risks. We use data analytics and visualisation systems to provide both our management and relevant authorities with higher quality suspicious activity reports. + #### Complying with financial sanctions Danske Bank complies with all legally applicable financial sanctions, including sanctions imposed by the UN, the EU and jurisdictions in which Danske Bank operates, including the UK. In addition, Danske Bank complies with US sanctions to the required extent due to the extraterritorial nature of those sanctions and for overall risk management reasons. At Danske Bank, we have processes in place to ensure that we do not offer banking services to sanctioned parties and that we do not engage in transactions or activities in violation of sanctions. Due to the overall financial crime risk associated with a specific country, area or sector, Danske Bank’s policy towards specific countries, areas, sectors, etc. may be more restrictive than applicable financial sanctions. We generally do not facilitate any business or transactions involving North Korea, Iran, Syria and the territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea and any other territory not under the control of the Ukrainian government. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have implemented a restrictive approach to any new business or activities involving Russia or Belarus. We also maintain a limited financial crime risk position for activities involving Cuba. We may consider processing specific transactions involving these territories, such as transactions related to humanitarian aid, if we receive a request from our customer in advance. We may, in our sole discretion, decide not to process transactions or provide certain products or services or decide to otherwise decline to facilitate transactions in cases where these activities fall outside Danske Bank’s risk appetite. ### Our Three-Lines-of-Defence ensures effective governance The-Three-Lines-of-Defence-Model is a key element in ensuring effective governance and oversight of financial crime risk - including ensuring that clearly defined roles and responsibilities are in place. **The 1st Line of Defence** owns and manages business activities and related risks. Includes business units and Group functions (e.g. operations, HR and finance). **The 2nd Line of Defence**provides risk management framework and performs risk oversight. Supports and challenges the 1st Line of Defence. Includes Group Compliance and Group Risk Management. **The 3rd Line of Defence** is an independent and objective unit (Internal Audit) evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes in relation to the control environments of the 1st and 2nd Lines of Defence. ## How this affects customers Preventing and fighting financial crime are two essential tasks that every responsible financial institution must perform. That is why we at Danske Bank have both an obligation and a commitment to comply with Danish and international anti-money laundering legislation and regulations and to fight money laundering and fraud against banks and customers. Among other things, this means that we continuously update our knowledge of our customers and their use of our products and services, carefully monitor transactions and cooperate closely with authorities in and outside Denmark We understand that customers can feel a little inconvenienced or even irritated when we ask for information and a copy of their proof of identity. However, just as the security check at the airport ensures that all travellers can enjoy a safe journey, it is both necessary and in the interest of us all. fd64f5f5-00090258-dd6cc6eb ## Financial crime policy and whistleblowing scheme ### Financial crime policy Our group-wide financial crime policy is a crucial part of our overall [Compliance Framework](/about-us/corporate-governance/compliance).

Lenahan-Pfahlert](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/l/lenahan-pfahlert-kelly) on September 4, 2024 Posted in [Civil Penalty](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/civil-penalty/), [Compliance Program](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/compliance-program/), [Correspondent Bank Accounts](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/correspondent-bank-accounts/), [Customer Due Diligence](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/customer-due-diligence/), [New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/new-york-department-of-financial-services/), [Panama Papers](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/panama-papers/), [Transaction Monitoring](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/transaction-monitoring/) ![Image 2](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/09/AdobeStock_56312148-656x437.jpeg) On August 27, 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) [announced](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20240827) a [consent order](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/08/ea20240827-co-nordea.pdf) involving a $35 million settlement with Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) for alleged significant failures related to anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance. Nordea, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, operates globally, including through a licensed branch in New York, [which has its own AML and transaction monitoring requirements](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2017/01/2016-year-in-review-nydfs-finalizes-broad-aml-regulations/). The enforcement action, which followed revelations from the [Panama Papers leak](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/12/first-u-s-indictment-relating-to-panama-papers-charges-lawyer-asset-manager-accountant-and-client/), found that Nordea allegedly failed to conduct proper due diligence on high-risk correspondent banking relationships and maintained inadequate AML controls. According to the NYDFS, the Panama Papers implicated Nordea in aiding clients in establishing offshore shell companies in order to facilitate illicit activities. The consent order alleges that Nordea violated New York law by allowing compliance failures in its AML program and procedures to persist. Meanwhile, [Danish officials recently charged Nordea](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/denmark-takes-nordea-court-possible-breaches-anti-money-laundering-act-2024-07-05/) with repeatedly violating Denmark’s anti-money laundering act between 2012 and 2015, thereby exposing Nordea, potentially, [to extremely significant fines](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/11/nordea-risks-money-laundering-fine-near-1-billion-experts-say/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Nordea%20Bank%20could,exceed%20the%20lender%27s%20own%20expectations.). As we will discuss, although the consent order implicates many different issues, the NYDFS enforcement action represents, in part, the latest chapter in the continued fall-out from the [massive AML scandal involving Dankse Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2023/01/sdny-sentences-danske-bank-in-massive-aml-scandal/). The consent order also highlights, once again, the particular risks posed by correspondent banking relationships, on which we repeatedly have blogged (for example, [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2021/03/amla-expands-doj-grand-jury-subpoena-power-over-correspondent-bank-accounts-and-foreign-banks/), [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/10/fincen-solicits-commentary-on-due-diligence-for-correspondent-and-private-bank-accounts/), and [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/06/28-north-korean-and-5-chinese-bankers-accused-of-a-2-5-billion-laundering-scheme/)). ### _Key Takeaways_ The Consent Order reflects that the NYDFS made the following findings: 1. **Deficient AML Program**: Nordea’s AML program, particularly within its Baltic branches (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and the International Branch in Denmark, exhibited significant deficiencies. These included insufficient policies and procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious activities, exposing the bank to heightened risks of money laundering. 2. **Inadequate Due Diligence**: Nordea failed to conduct adequate due diligence on its correspondent banking relationships. Failure to properly assess the risks associated with the banking parties may have facilitated money laundering. 3. **Insufficient Transaction Monitoring**: Nordea’s transaction monitoring system was inadequate, further exacerbating the risks associated with its AML compliance failures. 4. **High-Risk Transactions**: The NYDFS linked Nordea’s Baltic operations to billions of dollars in high-risk transactions. These transactions underscored the vulnerabilities in the bank’s control mechanisms. 5. **Prior Regulatory Warnings**: Regulatory bodies in Nordic countries previously identified weaknesses in Nordea’s AML compliance programs. Despite these warnings, the bank did not take adequate measures to address the identified issues, allowing the risks to persist. ### _Challenges in the Baltic Branches_ According to NYDFS, Nordea’s Baltic branches faced significant challenges in managing money laundering risks, particularly concerning customers from post-Soviet states with high corruption indices. Despite recognizing these risks, the bank’s efforts to enhance its AML compliance between 2010 and 2017 were insufficient. Audits conducted during this period revealed an overreliance on manual monitoring, inadequate customer identification data, and persistent shortcomings in Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) and Enhanced Due Diligence (“EDD”) processes. These issues left the bank vulnerable to financial crimes. ### _Issues at the International Branch at Vesterport_ Nordea’s International Branch in Vesterport, Denmark (“VIB”), which primarily served corporate customers with connections to Russia and Eastern Europe, was implicated in numerous money laundering scandals, including the Panama Papers, [Russian Laundromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Laundromat), and [Azerbaijani Laundromat](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat). Audits conducted in 2009 and 2013 allegedly identified significant gaps in CDD, EDD, and transaction monitoring processes. These deficiencies, coupled with media scrutiny and increased inquiries from correspondent banks, ultimately led to the branch’s closure in 2014. ### _Nordea’s Correspondent Banking and RMA Relationships_ Nordea maintained extensive correspondent banking relationships and exchanged SWIFT Relationship Management Application (“RMA”) keys with various financial institutions, including Danske Bank, ABLV, and Bank of Cyprus. The NYDFS found that Nordea failed to adequately manage and monitor the risks associated with these relationships. **Danske Bank** [Danske Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2019/03/massive-danske-bank-money-laundering-scandal-continues-to-unfold/), headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, had a significant correspondent banking relationship with Nordea, with substantial annual cross-border payment traffic. Despite adverse findings from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in 2012 and other issues, Nordea assigned Danske an AML risk class “A” rating in 2013. However, internal reviews in 2016 and 2017 identified significant compliance failures, necessitating a downgrade in Danske’s AML risk rating and increased monitoring. **ABLV** ABLV Bank, based in Latvia, [was identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) in 2018 as a primary money laundering concern](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/02/fincen-imposes-section-311-fifth-special-measure-on-latvian-bank-ablv/). Despite identifying numerous red flags, Nordea delayed terminating its relationship with ABLV until after FinCEN’s notice. NYDFS determined that this delay exposed Nordea to significant risks and highlighted the need for more timely and effective AML compliance measures. **Bank of Cyprus** The Bank of Cyprus, known for its associations with Russia, allegedly posed substantial money laundering risks. Despite identifying high risks and red flags, NYDFS found that Nordea maintained its relationship with the bank until 2019. Internal audits and KYC reviews allegedly revealed gaps in Nordea’s due diligence regarding the Bank of Cyprus. In 2015, Nordea’s internal audit revealed deficiencies in KYC procedures, including insufficient Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) screening, and lack of site visits at the Bank of Cyprus. The KYC file from that year flagged additional risks, including Cyprus’s status as an offshore financial center and ineffective financial oversight. Notably, the file identified three PEPs on the board of Bank of Cyprus, including a former KGB agent and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. It was not until 2023 that Nordea had fully exited its association with the Bank of Cyprus, closing all RMAs except those required by prior guarantees. ### _Transaction Monitoring_ In 2008, Nordea implemented an IT-supported transaction monitoring system, fully operational by 2010. Initially, the system included three monitoring scenarios, expanding to six by 2013, but did not cover correspondent banking transactions. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority identified these deficiencies in 2015, prompting Nordea to introduce 28 new monitoring scenarios in 2016, specifically for correspondent banking risks. Despite these enhancements, Nordea Bank Finland faced challenges integrating transaction data into the automated system, leading to the development of semi-automated controls by mid-2018. Additionally, Nordea allegedly failed to prevent transactions involving ABLV due to delays in updating internal sanctions lists, resulting in breaches of internal sanctions standards. Between 2016 and 2018, flagged transactions related to the Bank of Cyprus were not addressed, and the relationship continued until 2019. NYDFS acknowledged Nordea’s efforts to improve transaction monitoring but noted ongoing significant challenges and areas requiring improvement. ### _The Consent Order_ As part of the settlement, Nordea agreed to several measures to address the deficiencies identified by the NYDFS in addition to the $35 million monetary penalty. These measures include: 1. **Strengthening the AML Compliance Program**: Nordea committed to enhancing its AML policies, procedures, and controls to better detect and prevent money laundering activities. 2. **Enhancing Transaction Monitoring**: The bank agreed to upgrade its transaction monitoring system to more effectively identify and report suspicious activities. 3. **Rigorous Due Diligence on Correspondent Banking Relationships**: Nordea will conduct more thorough due diligence on its correspondent banking partners to ensure compliance with AML standards. 4. **Independent Compliance Review**: An independent consultant will be appointed to assess Nordea’s compliance with the Consent Order, providing recommendations for further improvements and ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon measures. 5. **Regular Progress Reports**: Nordea is required to submit periodic progress reports to the NYDFS, detailing the steps taken to comply with the Consent Order and the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

Für Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, die Feinheiten zu verstehen. ### Definition und Grundlagen der Geldwäsche Geldwäsche ist der Prozess, bei dem illegal erzielte Erlöse als legal erscheinen. Es ist eine Methode, die von Kriminellen verwendet wird, um ihre Aktivitäten und das damit verbundene Geld zu verschleiern und die Erträge aus ihren Verbrechen legitim erscheinen zu lassen. Dies wird oft durch eine komplexe Abfolge von Banküberweisungen oder kommerziellen Transaktionen erreicht, was die Rückverfolgung der ursprünglichen Geldquelle schwierig macht. Einige gut dokumentierte Beispiele für Geldwäsche sind die Verwendung von Bargeld für den Kauf von Lebensversicherungspolicen und deren anschließendes Verfallenlassen, der Kauf und Verkauf wertvoller Vermögenswerte wie Kunst und die Verwendung von [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) zur Verschleierung des Eigentums und des Transfers von Geldern, insbesondere im Immobiliensektor. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen bei [der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"handelsbasierte Geldwäsche\") und der Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen (MSBs) sind ebenfalls gängige Methoden zur Geldwäsche. ### Die Phasen der Geldwäsche Das Verständnis der [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) ist entscheidend, um diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Diese Phasen umfassen in der Regel die Platzierung, das Layering und die Integration. **Platzierung**: Dies ist der Prozess der Einführung des illegalen Geldes in das Finanzsystem. Dies kann durch die Aufteilung großer Bargeldbeträge in weniger auffällige kleinere Summen geschehen, die dann direkt auf ein Bankkonto eingezahlt werden, oder durch den Kauf einer Reihe von Instrumenten (wie Schecks oder Zahlungsanweisungen), die dann gesammelt und auf Konten an einem anderen Ort eingezahlt werden. **Schichtung**: In dieser Phase führt der Geldwäscher in der Regel eine Reihe von Umrechnungen oder Bewegungen der Gelder durch, um sie von ihrer Quelle zu entfernen. Das Layering kann aus mehreren Bank-zu-Bank-Überweisungen, Überweisungen zwischen verschiedenen Konten mit unterschiedlichen Namen in verschiedenen Ländern, Ein- und Auszahlungen bestehen, um den Geldbetrag auf den Konten kontinuierlich zu ändern, die Währung des Geldes zu ändern und hochwertige Gegenstände (wie Häuser oder Unternehmen) zu kaufen, um die Form des Geldes zu ändern. Dies wird manchmal als [komplexe Schichtung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) bezeichnet. **Integration**: Die letzte Phase des Prozesses. In der [Integrationsphase](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) gelangt das Geld in legitim aussehender Form wieder in die Mainstream-Ökonomie – es scheint aus einem legalen Geschäft zu stammen. Dabei kann es sich um eine abschließende Überweisung auf das Konto eines lokalen Unternehmens handeln, in das der Geldwäscher im Austausch für eine Gewinnkürzung „investiert“, um den Verkauf einer Immobilie, die während der Schichtungsphase gekauft wurde, oder einfach um die Ausgabe von Geld, das für Luxusgüter gewaschen wurde. Durch das Verständnis der Grundlagen der Geldwäsche und ihrer Phasen können sich Fachleute besser darauf vorbereiten, diese Aktivitäten zu erkennen und zu verhindern, die entscheidende Aspekte der [Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind. ## Ein Blick auf Beispiele aus dem wirklichen Leben Um die Dynamik der Geldwäsche besser zu verstehen, schauen wir uns Beispiele aus der Praxis an. Diese Fälle, in denen es um Lebensversicherungen, die Kunstwelt und Briefkastenfirmen im Immobilienbereich geht, enthüllen die komplizierten Strategien, mit denen illegale Gelder verschleiert werden. ### Geldwäsche durch Lebensversicherung Eine Methode der Geldwäsche sind Lebensversicherungen. Einzelpersonen verwenden Bargeld, um diese Policen zu kaufen, dann Kredite gegen sie aufzunehmen und schließlich die Policen verfallen zu lassen. Diese zirkuläre Methode verschleiert die Herkunft der Gelder und verleiht dem illegalen Bargeld einen Anstrich von Legitimität ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dieses Beispiel unterstreicht die Bedeutung von [Know-Your-Customer- (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) und [Kunden-Due-Diligence-Verfahren](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) im Versicherungssektor als Schlüsselkomponenten der [Anti-Geldwäsche-Compliance](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/). ### Geldwäsche in der Kunstwelt Die Kunstwelt ist ein weiterer Bereich, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Kriminelle kaufen und verkaufen wertvolle Kunstwerke, um die Herkunft des bei diesen Transaktionen verwendeten Bargelds zu verschleiern. Der hohe Wert von Kunstwerken, gepaart mit der subjektiven Natur ihrer Preisgestaltung, macht dies zu einem fruchtbaren Boden für Geldwäschesysteme. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit strenger Kontrollen und Transparenz bei hochwertigen Kunsttransaktionen. ### Briefkastenfirmen und Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen, insbesondere solche, an [denen Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) beteiligt sind, sind ein weiterer häufiger Kanal für Geldwäsche. Kriminelle kaufen Immobilien oft mit Bargeld und verschleiern ihr Eigentum durch Briefkastenfirmen oder versteckten Immobilienbesitz, um die Spur der Gelder zu verwischen und die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft zu erschweren ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). In einigen Fällen werden Immobilienbewertungen manipuliert, und Kriminelle arbeiten mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese illegale Praxis ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. In einem bemerkenswerten Fall hat ein Mann aus Honduras über 1 Million US-Dollar an Bestechungsgeldern durch internationale Überweisungen gewaschen, um Immobilien in New Orleans zu kaufen, darunter auch Büroräume ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). In einem anderen Fall soll eine Privatbank einem Konto des Vatikans erlaubt haben, 350 Millionen Dollar für Investitionen in Londoner Immobilien auszugeben und damit illegale Immobilientransaktionen zu erleichtern, darunter auch solche von Drogenhändlern, um Immobilien in Bulgarien zu kaufen ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, wie wichtig die Transparenz der [wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) bei Immobilientransaktionen ist und wie wichtig strenge Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in diesem Sektor sind. Sie heben auch die Herausforderungen hervor, mit denen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden bei der Verfolgung des Flusses illegaler Gelder konfrontiert sind, und die zentrale Rolle des [Offshore-Bankwesens](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) bei Geldwäschesystemen. ## Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche ist eine komplexe Form der Finanzkriminalität, bei der Handelstransaktionen genutzt werden, um illegal verdientes Geld zu verstecken, zu bewegen und zu investieren. Es ist neben Layering und Integration eine der drei grundlegenden Methoden der Geldwäsche, die alle in unserem Artikel über die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) untersucht werden können. ### Falsche Darstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen Bei handelsbasierter Geldwäsche werden der Preis, die Menge oder die Qualität von Waren oder Dienstleistungen falsch dargestellt, um Werte zwischen Ländern zu transferieren und die illegale Geldquelle zu verbergen ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Diese Methode kann sowohl in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) verwendet werden, um komplexe Transaktionsschichten zu erstellen, als auch in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) , um das gewaschene Geld wieder in die legale Wirtschaft einzuführen. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen kann verschiedene Formen annehmen, wie z. B. Überfakturierung, Unterfakturierung, Mehrfachrechnungsstellung oder falsche Beschreibung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen. Diese betrügerischen Praktiken werden häufig durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) und verschleierte [wirtschaftliche Eigentümerstrukturen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) erleichtert, was es den Behörden erschweren kann, diese Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu untersuchen. ### Fallstudien zur handelsbasierten Geldwäsche Ein bemerkenswertes Beispiel für handelsbasierte Geldwäsche war eine kriminelle Organisation, die unterbewertete Waren und gefälschte Rechnungen verwendete, um 1,8 Millionen US-Dollar an schmutzigem Geld zu waschen ([UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). In diesem Fall kaufte die Organisation Waren in einem Land zu einem niedrigen Preis und verkaufte sie dann in einem anderen Land zu einem viel höheren Preis. Die Preisdifferenz wurde zur Geldwäsche des Schwarzgeldes verwendet. Dieser Fall erinnert eindringlich daran, wie wichtig robuste Verfahren zur [Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind, einschließlich einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und einer kontinuierlichen Überwachung von Transaktionen. Durch das Verständnis der Techniken, die bei der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche eingesetzt werden, können Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, die mit dieser Art von illegalen Aktivitäten verbundenen Risiken besser erkennen und [mindern](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Minderung der Risiken\") . Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit einer kontinuierlichen Wachsamkeit und wirksamer Kontrollen im globalen Handelssektor. Da sich die von Kriminellen verwendeten Methoden ständig weiterentwickeln, ist es für Unternehmen von entscheidender Bedeutung, auf dem Laufenden zu bleiben und ihre [Strategien zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche\") entsprechend anzupassen. Durch das Verständnis der Taktiken, die bei der Geldwäsche angewendet werden, können Fachleute ihre Organisationen besser schützen und zum globalen Kampf gegen Finanzkriminalität beitragen. ## Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen Money Services Businesses (MSBs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle im globalen Finanzsystem und bieten Dienstleistungen wie Geldtransfer, Währungsumtausch und Scheckeinlösung an. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist jedoch zu einem erheblichen Problem bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche geworden, da diese Unternehmen die Bewegung von Geldern ohne angemessene Prüfung oder behördliche Aufsicht erleichtern können ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Nicht registrierte Geldübermittler Im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche nutzen Kriminelle häufig nicht registrierte Geldübermittler, eine Untergruppe von MSBs, aus, um illegale Gelder zu bewegen, ohne die Aufmerksamkeit der Behörden auf sich zu ziehen ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese nicht registrierten Unternehmen operieren unter dem Radar und umgehen die strengen Vorschriften und [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden,](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) denen traditionelle Finanzinstitute unterliegen. Überweisungen, die über diese nicht registrierten MSBs getätigt werden, hinterlassen möglicherweise keine Aufzeichnungen, was es schwierig macht, die ursprüngliche Quelle oder den endgültigen Bestimmungsort der Gelder zurückzuverfolgen. Dies macht sie zu einem idealen Kanal während der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/), in der das Ziel darin besteht, die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern. Die relative Leichtigkeit und Anonymität, die nicht registrierte Geldübermittler bieten, macht sie attraktiv für Kriminelle, die diese Dienste nutzen, um Geld unentdeckt über Grenzen zu bewegen. Dies ist eine große Herausforderung für [die weltweiten Bemühungen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche.](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) ### Fallstudien zum MSB-Missbrauch Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist leider keine Seltenheit, wobei zahlreiche Fälle auf der ganzen Welt verzeichnet wurden. So ist beispielsweise bekannt, dass Kriminelle MSBs nutzen, um Geld aus illegalen Aktivitäten wie Drogenhandel, Betrug und organisierter Kriminalität zu waschen. In vielen Fällen werden diese illegalen Gelder über nicht registrierte MSBs bewegt, was es für die Behörden schwierig macht, die Transaktionen zu erkennen und zurückzuverfolgen. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie wichtig eine solide regulatorische Aufsicht im Finanzsektor ist. Es unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit effektiver [Know-Your-Customer-Verfahren (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) einer strengen Überwachung von Transaktionen und einer gründlichen Due-Diligence-Prüfung, um einen solchen Missbrauch zu verhindern. Der Kampf gegen Geldwäsche ist kontinuierlich, wobei ständig neue Methoden und Techniken entstehen. Indem sie diese [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/) verstehen und daraus lernen, können sich Aufsichtsbehörden, Compliance-Beauftragte und Finanzinstitute besser darauf vorbereiten, illegale Geldflüsse in Zukunft zu erkennen und zu verhindern. ## Geldwäsche durch Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen bieten Kriminellen eine effektive Möglichkeit, illegale Gelder zu waschen. Die hochwertigen Transaktionen des Sektors in Kombination mit den oft komplexen rechtlichen und finanziellen Vereinbarungen stellen eine attraktive Gelegenheit für Kriminelle dar, die versuchen, ihre unrechtmäßig erworbenen Gewinne zu legitimieren. ### Kauf und Verkauf von Immobilien Eine gängige Methode, die Kriminelle anwenden, besteht darin, Immobilien mit Bargeld zu erwerben und deren Eigentum dann durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) oder verstecktes Eigentum zu verbergen ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Diese Methode verwischt die Spur der Gelder und erschwert die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft, was die Strafverfolgungsbehörden vor Herausforderungen stellt. Eine weitere Strategie ist die Manipulation von Immobilienbewertungen. Kriminelle arbeiten oft mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese Taktik ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. Kriminelle gründen auch Briefkastenfirmen in ausländischen Gerichtsbarkeiten, um Immobilien zu besitzen, was den grenzüberschreitenden Fluss illegaler Gelder erleichtert. Diese Methode erschwert es den Behörden, den Geldfluss zu verfolgen, und zeigt eine Methode, mit der Geldwäscheaktivitäten verschleiert werden. ### Fallstudien zur Geldwäsche im Immobilienbereich Immobiliengeldwäsche ist ein globales Problem. Laut einem Bericht von Global Financial Integrity (GFI) wurden von 2015 bis 2021 mehr als 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar über US-Immobilien gewaschen. Dies unterstreicht, dass Immobilien nach wie vor eine der beliebtesten Möglichkeiten sind, illegale Gelder zu bewegen. Ein weiteres Beispiel: In den letzten zehn Jahren flossen etwa 20 Milliarden US-Dollar in den Immobilienmarkt im Großraum Toronto in Kanada, ohne dass die Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörden eine angemessene Prüfung durchführten ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Region | Gewaschene Menge (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | USA | 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar | | Großraum Toronto, Kanada | 20 Milliarden US-Dollar | Diese Beispiele unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Wachsamkeit und wirksamer [Einhaltung der Geldwäschebekämpfung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) im Immobiliensektor. Wenn sie die Taktiken von Kriminellen verstehen und sich der [Warnsignale](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Rote Fahnen\") bewusst sind, können Fachleute im Immobiliensektor eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Unterbrechung dieser illegalen Finanzströme spielen. Für diejenigen, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, kann das Verständnis dieser [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) helfen, potenzielle Risiken zu identifizieren und effektive [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) zu implementieren. ## Geldwäsche-Skandale Trotz strenger [Compliance-Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) und behördlicher Kontrollen tauchen immer wieder Fälle von Geldwäsche in großem Maßstab auf. Schauen wir uns einige bemerkenswerte Geldwäscheskandale an, die in den letzten Jahren Schlagzeilen gemacht haben. ### Das FinCEN-Dateileck Im Jahr 2020 enthüllte das Durchsickern der FinCEN-Dateien (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) ein riesiges Netzwerk von Finanzkorruption. Über 400 Journalisten aus 88 Ländern arbeiteten an dieser Untersuchung zusammen und deckten verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von erstaunlichen 2 Billionen US-Dollar auf. Diese geheimen Dateien enthielten Informationen über Transaktionen, die von Banken als verdächtig gekennzeichnet wurden, aber fortgesetzt werden durften. Der Bericht hob schwerwiegende Versäumnisse in den globalen Bankensystemen hervor, die es ermöglichten, große Geldsummen ohne angemessene Kontrollen zu bewegen. Das FinCEN-Files-Leck unterstrich die Bedeutung einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der rigorosen Durchsetzung von [Know Your Customer (KYC)-](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) Vorschriften. Der Fall ist eine eindringliche Erinnerung an das potenzielle Ausmaß und die Komplexität von Geldwäscheoperationen. ### Das Panama-Papers-Leak Das Leak der Panama Papers im Jahr 2016 war eine monumentale Enthüllung, die zahlreiche aufsehenerregende Fälle von Geldwäsche, Steuerhinterziehung und Umgehung internationaler Sanktionen enthüllte. Das Leck betraf Banken, Anwaltskanzleien und hochkarätige Einzelpersonen weltweit und enthüllte das Ausmaß illegaler Finanzaktivitäten, die durch [Offshore-Banken](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) und [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) verschleiert wurden. Die Panama Papers hoben den Missbrauch anonymer Briefkastenfirmen hervor, um [wirtschaftliches Eigentum](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/). Infolgedessen führte der Skandal zu Forderungen nach mehr Transparenz bei Offshore-Finanzdienstleistungen und strengeren Vorschriften zur Identifizierung der wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer. ### Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon Der „Troika-Waschsalon“-Skandal umfasste die Geldwäsche von 4,6 Milliarden US-Dollar über ein Netzwerk von Scheinfirmen und illegale Finanztransaktionen zwischen 2006 und 2013. An diesem System waren mehrere Parteien in verschiedenen Gerichtsbarkeiten beteiligt, was die globale Reichweite von Geldwäscheoperationen zeigt. Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon brachte den Missbrauch von Briefkastenfirmen ans Licht, um die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/). Der Skandal führte zu Ermittlungen und rechtlichen Schritten, was die Bedeutung der globalen Zusammenarbeit bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche weiter unterstreicht. Jeder dieser Skandale unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche und die anhaltende Notwendigkeit von Wachsamkeit und Durchsetzung. Durch die Untersuchung dieser „Geldwäschebeispiele“ können Fachleute in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität ein tieferes Verständnis für die von Geldwäschern angewandten Taktiken erlangen und erfahren, wie diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufgedeckt und verhindert werden können. ## Aus Geldwäschefällen lernen Das Verständnis realer Szenarien ist eine der effektivsten Möglichkeiten, den komplexen Prozess der Geldwäsche zu verstehen. Dieser Abschnitt wirft einen genaueren Blick auf einige der bedeutendsten Geldwäschebeispiele der jüngeren Geschichte, um wertvolle Einblicke in den Ablauf dieser Ereignisse und die daraus gezogenen Lehren zu geben. ### Der Fall Wachovia Bank Im Jahr 2010 war die Wachovia Bank in eine umfangreiche Geldwäscheoperation verwickelt, an der mexikanische Drogenkartelle beteiligt waren. Zwischen 2004 und 2007 ermöglichte die Bank über ihre Filialen die Geldwäsche von fast 390 Milliarden US-Dollar. Die illegalen Gelder, die aus dem Drogenhandel in den USA stammten, wurden über die mexikanische Grenze geschmuggelt und später auf die US-Konten von Wachovia zurücküberwiesen. Die Bank hat es versäumt, die Herkunft dieser Gelder zu überprüfen und ist damit ihren [Know Your Customer (KYC)-Verpflichtungen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) nicht nachgekommen. Anstelle einer Strafverfolgung zahlte Wachovia eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 160 Millionen US-Dollar und versprach, seine [Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche (AML)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verbessern. ### Der Standardfall der Chartered Bank Die Standard Chartered Bank wurde wegen wiederholter Verstöße gegen US-Sanktionen mit hohen Strafen belegt. Nachdem die Bank 2012 zunächst mit einer Geldstrafe von 670 Millionen US-Dollar wegen Verstößen gegen den Iran belegt worden war, wurde sie 2019 erneut beschuldigt, Sanktionen gegen Länder wie Simbabwe, Burma, Iran, Sudan, Kuba und Syrien ignoriert zu haben. Für diese Verstöße verhängten die US-amerikanischen und britischen Behörden eine Geldstrafe von insgesamt 1,1 Milliarden US-Dollar gegen Standard Chartered und unterstrichen damit die schwerwiegenden Folgen einer Missachtung des Völkerrechts. ### Der Fall Danske Bank Die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank diente zwischen 2007 und 2015 als Kanal für geschätzte 228 Milliarden US-Dollar an gewaschenen Geldern. Dieser Skandal, in den Tausende von verdächtigen Kunden verwickelt waren, lenkte die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit auf die Compliance-Versäumnisse der Bank. Die dänischen Behörden verhängten Geldstrafen in Höhe von insgesamt 2 Millionen US-Dollar und wiesen mehreren Managern der Bank die Schuld zu. ### Der Fall BCCI Die Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) war an Betrugs [– und Geldwäscheaktivitäten](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) in Höhe von insgesamt bis zu 23 Milliarden US-Dollar beteiligt. Die BCCI nutzte ausgeklügelte Geldwäschesysteme wie [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/), Datenschutzoasen, Provisionen und Bestechung. Die Schließung der Bank im Jahr 1991 führte zu zahlreichen rechtlichen Schritten, darunter die Klage der BCCI gegen die Bank of England wegen Nachlässigkeit bei der Identifizierung von Frühwarnzeichen. Dieser Fall unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster AML-Compliance-Programme ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche unterstreichen die Bedeutung strenger AML-Verfahren, einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der Notwendigkeit, die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) zu verstehen, um Finanzkriminalität aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Indem sie aus diesen Fällen lernen, können Fachleute im Bereich Compliance und Risikomanagement ihre Unternehmen besser auf ähnliche Situationen vorbereiten und schützen.

Les blanchisseurs, pas de frontières. Ces derniers profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance et des législations européennes pour passer entre les mailles du filet. Avec la création, cet été, de l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (Anti-Money Laundering Authority ou AMLA), l’Union européenne peut-elle centraliser la lutte contre la finance illicite?** * * * L’inclusion probable et imminente de Monaco, symbole mondial de richesse et de discrétion, dans la [liste des pays à haut risque en matière de blanchiment d’argent](https://www.touteleurope.eu/economie-et-social/blanchiment-d-argent-quels-pays-sont-consideres-a-risque-par-la-commission-europeenne/) établie par l’Union européenne (UE), a suscité de nombreuses réactions. L’ajout potentiel de la principauté sur la liste noire met en évidence le défi que représente la lutte contre la finance illicite. Dans une zone comme l’UE, l’ouverture des frontières contraste avec la mise en œuvre et la surveillance des mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ([l’AML –Anti-Money Laundering](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en?prefLang=fr)). Des politiques qui restent largement confinées à la responsabilité des différents pays membres. Une [transaction financière](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022SC0344&utm_) peut commencer dans un pays à haut risque, passer par une banque européenne et se terminer par une transaction immobilière à Londres ou un trust suisse. C’est précisément pour cette raison que la coordination internationale est si importante. Sans elle, les blanchisseurs d’argent profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance, en particulier au sein de l’UE. Avec l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent , ou Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), qui entre en fonction cet été, l’Union européenne opte pour la [centralisation](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jfc-03-2023-0059/full/pdf). Les politiques européennes et françaises de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ont échoué [pour plusieurs raisons](https://op.europa.eu/fr/publication-detail/-/publication/03f702aa-03bb-11ec-8f47-01aa75ed71a1/language-fr): une application inégale des réglementations, un manque de ressources et de coopération internationale, des sanctions peu dissuasives face à des techniques toujours plus sophistiquées et un phénomène global difficile à cerner. Pour progresser, il faut renforcer l’harmonisation des règles, augmenter les moyens des autorités, adopter des technologies avancées et améliorer la transparence des structures. Des objectifs que l’AMLA a précisément [vocation à concrétiser](https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en). Cent milliards d’euros par an ----------------------------- Quelques rares et prudentes estimations confirment que les flux financiers illicites traversent trop facilement les frontières et que leurs montants sont colossaux. Selon les estimations de l’Office des Nations unies contre la drogue et le crime (ONUDC), le [blanchiment d’argent représenterait de 2% à 5% du PIB mondial, soit de 800 milliards à 2 000 milliards de dollars américains](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) actuels. Dans l’Union européenne, le produit des activités criminelles est [estimé à plus de 100 milliards d’euros par an](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/criminal_asset_recovery_in_the_eu_web_version_0.pdf), dont seul un pourcentage négligeable est finalement saisi. [Des recherches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75653-x) estiment que l’argent provenant du trafic de drogue, du trafic des personnes et du terrorisme passe souvent par des banques de 4 à 6 pays différents avant d’être blanchi et d’entrer dans l’économie légale. * * * ![Image 7](https://images.theconversation.com/files/652674/original/file-20250303-32-etg46y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip) _Du lundi au vendredi + le dimanche, recevez gratuitement les analyses et décryptages de nos experts pour un autre regard sur l’actualité.

La [Danske Bank](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180924-danemark-estonie-danske-bank-scandale-oligarque) est devenue l’épicentre du plus grand scandale de blanchiment d’argent en Europe. Il a été révélé que plus de 200 milliards d’euros de transactions suspectes ont transité par sa succursale estonienne. La [Deutsche Bank](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/banque-assurances/des-centaines-de-milliards-de-dollars-dargent-sale-blanchis-par-de-grandes-banques-1244280) a fait l’objet de multiples enquêtes pour avoir facilité des transferts illicites de plusieurs milliards d’euros, notamment par le biais de sa collaboration avec Danske et de ses liens avec le système _Russian Laundromat_. [ING](https://trends.levif.be/a-la-une/banque/ing-a-verse-775-millions-deuros-pour-regler-une-affaire-de-blanchiment/) a payé une amende de 775 millions d’euros aux autorités néerlandaises pour des violations de la législation anti-blanchiment en 2018. Tracfin en France ----------------- Les pays de l’Union européenne mettent en œuvre les directives européennes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, avec des niveaux d’ambition variables. La France a montré un [engagement ferme](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin/la-qualite-du-dispositif-francais-de-lbc-ft-reconnue-par-le-gafi) dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent grâce à l’approche de sa cellule de renseignement financier, [Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins (Tracfin)](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin). Elle a récemment renforcé son analyse des [transactions suspectes](https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/4153148-20250513-tracfin-recu-nombre-record-declarations-soupcon-2024), élargi sa coopération avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux et amélioré son utilisation des analyses de données avancées pour détecter les flux illicites complexes. Malgré ces progrès, certaines affaires récentes, comme les failles des [néobanques](https://theconversation.com/qonto-monabanq-hellobank-lascension-des-neobanques-ira-t-elle-trop-loin-242541) ou l’enquête visant BNP Paribas pour blanchiment via [Chypre](https://decouverte.challenges.fr/economie/france-bnp-paribas-pris-dans-une-enquete-pour-blanchiment-aggrave-liee-a-chypre_878359), montrent que des flux illicites échappent encore à la détection de Tracfin. Dissuader les défaillances des contrôles bancaires internes ----------------------------------------------------------- Malgré son poids économique, l’Allemagne a été [critiquée](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/cash-hungry-germany-criticised-by-watchdog-over-money-laundering) pour son implication insuffisante, ainsi que pour les défaillances de sa surveillance. La mise en œuvre de sa politique varie d’un Land à l’autre; les difficultés rencontrées en matière de coopération internationale, en particulier avant l’effondrement de la société spécialisée dans le paiement électronique Wirecard, n’aident pas. En revanche, les autorités néerlandaises ont suivi l’exemple des États-Unis. Ils ont infligé des amendes importantes à des établissements tels que [ING](https://www.prosecutionservice.nl/latest/news/2018/09/04/ing-pays-775-million-due-to-serious-shortcomings-in-money-laundering-prevention) et [ABN AMRO](https://apnews.com/article/business-netherlands-money-laundering-b7c07284946e1561c1f2231de30dcfef), démontrant ainsi leur ferme volonté de lutter contre la criminalité financière en dissuadant les défaillances des contrôles internes dans les banques. * * * _**Read more: [Credit Suisse: les leçons d’une lente descente aux enfers](https://theconversation.com/credit-suisse-les-lecons-dune-lente-descente-aux-enfers-202363)**_ * * * Ces approches inégales de la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans les États membres de l’UE s’expliquent par [plusieurs facteurs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0170_EN.html). Les différentes interprétations des règles en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent créent des lacunes dans la couverture juridique. Une coopération judiciaire transfrontalière irrégulière, en particulier avec les pays tiers, entrave l’efficacité de l’application de la législation. En outre, les cellules de renseignement financier ont des pouvoirs et des responsabilités très variables. L’absence de format standardisé pour les déclarations d’opérations suspectes complique l’intégration des données dans la plate-forme centrale de l’Union européenne. Elle rend la coordination des actions plus difficile qu’elle ne devrait l’être. Mais tout cela est sur le point de changer… Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AMLA) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Pour remédier à ces faiblesses, l’Union européenne est en train de créer l’[Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/753212c5-166b-48ae-a44f-ffbb09a1eede/files/3de11274-cba7-414d-b0dd-6fbfcabf4d10), ou _Anti-Money Laundering Authority_ (AMLA). Elle devrait être pleinement opérationnelle à partir de 2028. Basée à Francfort, l’AMLA supervisera directement une quarantaine d’établissements financiers transfrontaliers à haut risque, harmonisera l’application des règles dans les États membres et coordonnera les régulateurs nationaux. Elle aura le pouvoir de mener des inspections sur place, d’imposer des sanctions et de renforcer le cadre global de l’UE en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. ![Image 8](https://images.theconversation.com/files/678599/original/file-20250707-56-wmpqc5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip) L’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, créée en 2024 par l’Union européenne, est chargée de la traque des flux financiers suspects.[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stuttgart-germany-03102025-person-holding-cellphone-2604415937) Afin de soutenir le rôle de l’AMLA, l’UE introduit un règlement unique qui remplacera les différentes législations nationales par un ensemble de normes unifiées dans tous les États membres. Avec l’AMLA, Bruxelles parie que la centralisation peut réussir là où la décentralisation a échoué. La décentralisation signifie que chaque État membre appliquait les règles anti-blanchiment à sa manière, en transposant les directives européennes dans son droit national. Cela a conduit à des normes [contradictoires](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12027-024-00805-9). Par exemple, certains pays imposaient des seuils de déclaration différents ou avaient des définitions divergentes des entités à surveiller, rendant la coopération inefficace et les contrôles inégaux. Avertissement symbolique ------------------------ L’AMLA pourrait se heurter à des difficultés. La complexité des différences juridiques et institutionnelles entre les États membres, la mobilisation de nombreuses expertises pour superviser un large éventail de secteurs, pourrait rendre ce travail fastidieux. La nécessité de trouver un équilibre entre les préoccupations en matière de souveraineté nationale et la nécessité d’une application efficace et unifiée dans toute l’UE également. Alors que l’Union européenne se prépare à lancer l’AMLA, l’inclusion de pays comme Monaco sur sa liste noire est un avertissement symbolique. Désormais, aucune juridiction, aussi riche ou prestigieuse soit-elle, n’est à l’abri d’un examen minutieux. Le devenir de l’AMLA comme véritable autorité de contrôle puissante dépendra de trois piliers: la volonté politique, la solidité de sa conception institutionnelle et l’ampleur des moyens humains et techniques qui lui seront alloués. Sans volonté politique, l’AMLA risque d’être affaiblie par les intérêts nationaux. Sans conception institutionnelle solide, ses compétences pourraient se heurter à des obstacles juridiques et bureaucratiques. Sans moyens humains et techniques suffisants, elle ne pourra pas exercer une supervision directe et efficace sur les entités à haut risque ni coordonner les autorités nationales. * [Union européenne (UE)](https://theconversation.com/topics/union-europeenne-ue-20281) * [frontières](https://theconversation.com/topics/frontieres-20283) * [finance](https://theconversation.com/topics/finance-20382) * [entreprises](https://theconversation.com/topics/entreprises-20563) * [Organisation des Nations unies (ONU)](https://theconversation.com/topics/organisation-des-nations-unies-onu-20684) * [fraude](https://theconversation.com/topics/fraude-21144) * [droit](https://theconversation.com/topics/droit-21145) * [économie](https://theconversation.com/topics/economie-23177) * [coopération](https://theconversation.com/topics/cooperation-29450) * [mafia](https://theconversation.com/topics/mafia-30332) * [crime](https://theconversation.com/topics/crime-61345) * [fraude fiscale](https://theconversation.com/topics/fraude-fiscale-111273) * [« Entreprise(s) »](https://theconversation.com/topics/entreprise-s-137378) ### Want to write?

Das unter Führung der S&D-Fraktion ausgehandelte Gesetzespaket wird die Spielregeln stark verändern und dazu beitragen, Skandale zu verhindern, wie wir sie in den letzten Jahren nur allzu oft erlebt haben. Das übergeordnete Ziel der neuen Rechtsvorschriften ist die Vereinheitlichung der geltenden nationalen Regeln – die zu fragmentiert und nicht gut aufeinander abgestimmt sind –, mit dem Ziel, die Vorschriften besser durchsetzen zu können und den gemeinsamen Kampf gegen Geldwäsche zu verstärken. Die Bedeutung der neuen Regeln lässt sich anhand einiger konkreter Beispiele illustrieren: Für Superreiche, zu denen auch russische Oligarchen zählen, wird es sehr viel schwerer, das System zu überlisten und Kontrollen zu umgehen. Die Vorschriften dienen außerdem dazu, im Fußball aufzuräumen, und die Risiken einzudämmen, die aus der Vergabe „goldener Visa“ resultieren. **Eero** **Heinäluoma, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Wirtschaftsausschuss, sagte:** „Heute ist ein guter Tag für die Bürger und Unternehmen in der EU und ein schlechter Tag für Oligarchen und Terroristen. Die lang erwartete Reform war angesichts der Skandale in den letzten Jahren, an denen die Danske Bank und die Credit Suisse beteiligt waren, und der jüngsten Enthüllungen aus Zypern wahrhaft notwendig. Die neuen Regeln werden die Dunkelmänner hinter undurchsichtigen rechtlichen Strukturen ans Licht bringen. Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt zu mehr Unternehmenstransparenz. Sie gilt auch für Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU: Falls diese in der EU Geschäfte machen wollen, müssen sie ihre Eigentumsverhältnisse im Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer offenlegen. Da bei der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung Bargeld eine große Rolle spielt, werden Barzahlungen über 10.000 Euro in der EU verboten. Dadurch können Transaktionen mithilfe hoher Geldbeträge besser kontrolliert werden, um Geldwäsche zu verhindern.“ **Paul Tang, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Justizausschuss, meinte:** „Eins unserer Hauptziele war, dafür zu sorgen, dass Wirtschaftskriminelle nicht länger durch den Kauf teurer Autos, Jachten und Privatflugzeuge Geldwäsche betreiben können. Die neuen Vorschriften erschweren es den Reichen und Mächtigen, ohne richtige Kontrollen in der EU zu investieren und Sanktionen zu umgehen, da ihre Prestigeobjekte nun den Behörden gemeldet werden müssen. Durch diese historische Einigung entstehen das erste einheitliche europäische Regelwerk zur Geldwäschebekämpfung und eine neue EU-Behörde mit umfassenden Kontroll- und Koordinierungsbefugnissen. Nicht nur der Finanz-, sondern auch der Nichtfinanzsektor wird künftig wesentlich strengeren Regeln und einer verstärkten Aufsicht unterworfen. Wichtig ist, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten.“ **Hinweis für die Redaktion:** Das Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket besteht aus einer Verordnung und einer Richtlinie zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung sowie einer Verordnung zur Errichtung einer neuen EU-Behörde, deren Aufgabe es sein wird, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung zu unterbinden. Über die letztgenannte Verordnung wurde bereits letzten Monat Einigkeit erzielt, während der Rest des Pakets gestern Abend festgezurrt wurde. **Hier eine Liste der wichtigsten von der S&D-Fraktion durchgesetzten Punkte in dem Paket:** **In der Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Erweiterung der Liste von Einrichtungen, die die Vorschriften befolgen müssen, um hochrangige Profifußballvereine und -agenten, Anbieter von Kryptowerten, Vermittler von „goldenen Visa“ sowie Personen, die mit Luxusgütern handeln. Da das Fußballgeschäft und seine Risiken in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten jedoch sehr unterschiedlich sind, können für kleinere Vereine Ausnahmen gelten, falls das Risiko nachweislich gering ist und sie von der Kommission genehmigt werden. Die neuen Regeln im Bereich des Fußballs müssen erst fünf Jahre nach ihrem Inkrafttreten angewendet werden statt nach drei Jahren wie bei allen anderen Verpflichteten. * Einstufung der Bürgermeister bestimmter Städte sowie der Geschwister von Regierungsmitgliedern und anderen hochrangigen Politikern als „politisch exponierte Personen“, für die eine höhere Sorgfaltspflicht gilt * Aufnahme gezielter Sanktionen in die Rechtsvorschriften, damit Instrumente zur Geldwäschebekämpfung eingesetzt werden können, mit denen sich versuchte Sanktionsumgehungen aufdecken lassen * Eindämmung der Risiken, die von Personen ausgehen, die sich Aufenthaltsrechte durch Investitionen erkaufen wollen, auch als „goldene Visa“ bekannt, mittels eines neuen Kontrollregimes, bei dem die Antragsteller stärker kontrolliert werden * Einführung eines komplett harmonisierten Regelwerks für wirtschaftliches Eigentum, das bessere Einblicke in die Eigentümer von Unternehmen in Hochrisikosektoren erlaubt, sowie Sicherstellung, dass Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU in bestimmten Fällen ihre wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer in EU-Register eintragen müssen, etwa wenn sie Immobilien in der EU erwerben oder besitzen * Sicherstellung, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten: Wir haben dafür gesorgt, dass dieser Sektor bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung denselben Vorschriften und Pflichten unterliegt wie der traditionelle Finanzsektor, insbesondere was die Sorgfaltspflicht bei Feststellung der Kundenidentität und die Pflichten hinsichtlich der Korrespondenzbankbeziehungen angeht. * Einführung einer Meldepflicht bei Handelsgeschäften mit hochwertigen Gütern wie Luxusautos, Flugzeugen und Booten, die die Verpflichteten bei den Zentralstellen für Geldwäsche-Verdachtsanzeigen (FIU) melden müssen * Verschärfung der Wachsamkeit in Bezug auf hochvermögende Kunden mit hohem Risiko * Verbot von Barzahlungen von über 10.000 Euro **In der Richtlinie zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Einführung strengerer Zulassungs- und Registrierungsanforderungen für Verpflichtete und von Befugnissen für die Aufsichtsbehörden zur Überprüfung der fachlichen Eignung und Zuverlässigkeit von Führungskräften * Stärkung der Verantwortung und Verbesserung der Vorgaben für die Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer in den Mitgliedstaaten: Nach den neuen Regeln sind die EU-Länder befugt, zu überprüfen, ob die Angaben zu den wirtschaftlichen Eigentümern angemessen, präzise und aktuell sind. * Einführung klarer Regeln, die sicherstellen, dass Journalisten, die Zivilgesellschaft und andere, die ein berechtigtes Interesse geltend machen, Zugang zu den Angaben haben * Verpflichtung der Mitgliedstaaten, ihre Regeln für die Vergabe „goldener Visa“ so zu ändern, dass die Risiken gemindert werden, sowie Übertragung der Befugnis an die Kommission, die Bemühungen zur Risikominderung zu bewerten * Einrichtung einer zentralen Zugangsstelle für die nationalen zentralen Meldestellen (FIU), über die Informationen über Immobilienbesitzer abgefragt werden können * Verbesserung des Zugangs der zentralen Meldestellen zu Informationen aus verschiedenen Quellen und Ausbau der EU-weiten Zusammenarbeit zwischen diesen Stellen, um sie in die Lage zu versetzen, bei komplexen oder grenzüberschreitenden Fällen mit Unterstützung der europäischen Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörde (AMLA) gemeinsame Analysen vorzunehmen * Verbesserung des Aufsichtsrahmens und der Zusammenarbeit unter der Ägide der ALMA und vermehrte Beaufsichtigung des Nichtfinanzsektors, insbesondere durch die Möglichkeit der Einrichtung von Kollegien * Sicherstellung eines stärker harmonisierten, wirkungsvollen und abschreckenden Rahmens für Geldstrafen und Verwaltungssanktionen **In der Verordnung** **zur Errichtung der europäischen Anti‑Geldwäsche-Behörde (AMLA):** * Ausweitung des Geltungsbereichs der direkten Beaufsichtigung durch die Behörde auf eine größere Gruppe von Unternehmen, darunter Anbieter von Kryptowerten * Einrichtung besonderer Befugnisse, damit die Behörde bei Aufsichtsversagen eingreifen und selbst Aufsichtsaufgaben übernehmen oder auch Verfahren wegen Verletzung des Unionsrechts einleiten kann * Sicherstellung einer wirksamen Rolle für die Behörde zur Unterstützung der Finanzermittlungsstellen und zur Koordinierung von deren Tätigkeiten, insbesondere durch Mithilfe bei gemeinsamen Analysen * Übertragung der Befugnis an die Behörde, Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den Finanzaufsichtsbehörden verbindlich beizulegen und als Vermittler zwischen Aufsichtsbehörden im Nichtfinanzbereich aufzutreten * Sicherstellung neuer Kompetenzen für die Behörde zur Beaufsichtigung des Nichtfinanzsektors, einschließlich der Befugnis, bei Versagen der nationalen Aufsichtsbehörden einzuschreiten ##

Nov. 2017 | 09:00 Uhr | von Gerd Mischler Aktualisiert am: 16. Jan. 2024 ## Wirecard, Siemens, VW # Die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale in Deutschland Manager-Versagen oder kriminelle Energie: Für diese 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale mussten die Beteiligten oft beides aufbringen. Diese Firmen waren mit besonderem „Engagement“ dabei. Können Sie sich noch erinnern? Schon so einige deutsche Unternehmen und Manager haben Negativschlagzeilen gemacht. Wir haben die größten Skandale für Sie zusammengestellt. (Bild: Goss Vitalij - stock.adobe.com) Ob Steuerbetrug, Schneeballsystem oder großflächige Bilanzfälschung: Deutsche Unternehmen haben sich in der Vergangenheit einiges einfallen lassen, um in die (negativen) Schlagzeilen zu kommen. Wir haben die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale zusammengetragen – garantiert subjektiv und ausdrücklich nicht wertfrei. #### Platz 10: Arcandor – Thomas Middelhoff veruntreut Millionen Obwohl es ihm nicht gelungen war, den Handelskonzern Arcandor und seine Töchter Karstadt, Quelle, Primondo und Thomas Cook zu retten, lässt sich Vorstandschef Thomas Middelhoff kurz vor der Pleite im Jahr 2009 rund 2,3 Millionen Euro Bonus auszahlen. Dafür wurde er wegen Veruntreuung zu drei Jahren Haft verurteilt, von denen er zwei absitzen musste. Middelhoff pendelte außerdem auf Firmenkosten für 1,1 Millionen Euro mit dem Hubschrauber von seiner Villa in Bielefeld zur Arbeit in die Essener Arcandorzentrale und ließ sich mit Privatjets in seine Villa in St. Tropez und nach New York fliegen. Einen Beigeschmack hinterließ auch der Verkauf von fünf Immobilien an einen Fonds, an dem Middelhoff und seine Frau beteiligt waren. Der Fonds vermietete die fünf Kaufhäuser für durchschnittlich gut 8,5 Millionen Jahresmiete an Karstadt. Für ihre 164 anderen Filialen zahlte die Kette dagegen nur jeweils 1,7 Millionen Euro Miete. #### Platz 9: Mannesmann-Vodafone – Abfindungsaffäre bei Übernahme Der Deal ist perfekt. Am 4. Februar 2000 stimmt nach einer spektakulären Abwehrschlacht der Mannesmann-Aufsichtsrat der Übernahme des Industriekonzerns durch Vodafone für 178 Milliarden Euro zu. Noch am selben Tag verteilen im Aufsichtsratsausschuss für Vorstandsangelegenheiten Deutsche-Bank-Vorstand Josef Ackermann, Mannesmann-Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Funk und IG-Metall-Boss Klaus Zwickel 30 Millionen Euro „Anerkennungsprämien“ an Topmanager bei Mannesmann. Obwohl eine Stuttgarter Kanzlei deshalb am 24. Februar 2000 Anzeige wegen des Verdachts auf Untreue erstattet, verteilt der Ausschuss im März weitere 32 Millionen Euro an bereits pensionierte Mannesmann-Vorstände. Das Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf spricht Ackermann, Funk und Zwickel zunächst vom Vorwurf der Untreue frei. Später hebt der Bundesgerichtshof das Urteil auf. Im zweiten Anlauf wird das Verfahren gegen eine Zahlung von 5,8 Millionen Euro eingestellt. ## Platz 8: Flowtex - Schneeballsystem mit fiktiven Bohrmaschinen In den 90er Jahren betrog der badische Unternehmer Manfred Schmider Banken und Versicherungen um rund zwei Milliarden Euro. Seine Firma Flowtex produzierte Horizontalbohrsysteme, mit denen man unterirdisch Kabel verlegt, ohne die Straßen aufzureißen. Flowtex verkaufte zahlreiche dieser Systeme an Investoren und leaste sie anschließend zurück. Dieses Vorgehen ist an sich nicht unüblich, nur dass in diesem Fall die meisten der Geräte gar nicht existierten. Das Unternehmen täuschte einen hohen Bestand an Bohrern vor, indem es an die wenigen real exisiterenden Systeme immer neue Seriennummern schraubte. Um die Leasingraten zahlen zu können, musste die Firma im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr fiktive Maschinen verkaufen – es war ein Schneeballsystem. Im Februar 2000, nur Tage vor dem geplanten Börsengang, wurden Schmider und weitere Verantwortliche festgenommen. Er war sieben Jahre in Haft, bevor er auf Bewährung entlassen wurde. Im Jahr 2016 wurde er in der Schweiz dann erneut zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt - wegen Geldwäsche. ## Das sind die 6 größten Schneeballsysteme der Geschichte 1. **Madoff Investment Securities**. Anlageverluste: 60 Milliarden Euro - Die nach ihrem Gründer Bernhard Madoff benannte Investmentfirma galt lange Zeit als einer der zuverlässigsten Partner an der Wall Street. Allerdings stellte sich 40 Jahre später heraus, dass Madoff die Renditen seiner Kunden mit den Einlagen neuer Kunden bezahlte. Seine Söhne zeigten ihn schließlich an und ein Gericht verurteilte ihn zu 150 Jahren Gefängnis. Sein Betrug betraf Millionen von Menschen und trieb etliche in den Selbstmord. 2. **MMM.** Anlageverluste: Über 1,85 Milliarden Euro - 1989 gründete Sergey Mavrodi in Moskau mit seinem Bruder und seiner Frau MMM. Das Unternehmen verkaufte sehr erfolgreich Bürogeräte, bis Probleme mit dem Finanzamt auftraten. Daraufhin wechselte MMM in den Finanzsektor und gab alsbald eigene Aktien heraus. Diese wurden ohne erkennbaren Grund stetig teurer. Die Zahl der Anleger stieg rapide an, nachdem eine Rendite von bis zu 1.000 Prozent kolportiert wurde. Innerhalb von sechs Monaten stieg der Wert der Wertpapiere um das 127-fache. Im Jahr 1994 versprach das Unternehmen Dividenden in Höhe von 3.000 Prozent pro Jahr. Allerdings wurden die hohen Zinsen auf alte Einlagen immer nur durch das Anziehen neuer Einlagen finanziert. Als das Geld nicht mehr ausreichte, reduzierte MMM die Papiere auf den Ausgabewert. Das System brach zusammen. Unmittelbar nach dieser Nachricht begingen 50 Menschen Selbstmord. Mavrodi wurde verhaftet und verurteilt. Seine Machenschaften betrafen rund 15 Millionen Menschen. 3. **Stanford International Bank**. Anlageverlust: 7,4 Milliarden Euro - Der erfolglose Immobilienmakler Robert Allen Stanford gründete 1986 in Antigua und Barbuda die Stanford International Bank. Diese Bank gab Einlagenzertifikate als Alternative zu einer Einlage aus und warb mit Renditen weit über dem Marktwert. Die Einlagen schienen durch das Vermögen gedeckt zu sein, da Stanford die Bilanzen der Bank frisierte. Die hohen Zinsen auf die Einlagenzertifikate wurden tatsächlich nur durch das Geld neuer Anleger gezahlt. Dies funktionierte 23 Jahre lang, bis Robert Allen Stanford im Jahr 2012 wegen Betrugs zu einer Haftstrafe von 110 Jahren verurteilt wurde. 4. **European Kings Club**. Anlageverlust: 1 Milliarde Euro´- Der Fall \\'European Kings Club\\' war das größte europäische Schneeballsystem und war von 1992 bis 1994 im DACH-Bereich aktiv. Der Klub sollte seinen Mitgliedern, KMU-Unternehmern, finanzielle Unterstützung bieten. Um Mitglied zu werden, musste man sich einen Anteil für umgerechnet 715 Euro kaufen. Dafür sollten dann jeden Monat etwa 102 Euro ausgezahlt werden - natürlich mit den Anteilserlösen der neuesten Mitglieder. Das funktionierte, bis die Behörden die Gründerin des Clubs, Damara Bertges, und ihren Partner verhafteten. Die Finanzämter beschlagnahmten 255,6 Millionen Euro und gaben sie an die Investoren zurück. 5. **Caritas / John Stoica**. Anlageverluste: 930 Millionen Euro - Innerhalb eines Jahres betrog John Stoica mit seiner Firma Caritas (die Namensgleichheit mit der karitativen kirchlichen Organisation war beabsichtigt) rund 4 Millionen Rumänen. Er versprach Zinsen von 800 Prozent in 3 Monaten. Sogar Teile der Regierung und Verwaltung unterstützten das Unternehmen. Das Schneeballsystem brach schnell zusammen. Viele Rumänen hatten investiert und es bestand die Furcht vor Straßenprotesten und weiteren Reaktionen wütender Investoren. Caritas nahm etwa 3 Milliarden US-Dollar ein und besaß auf dem Höhepunkt des Erfolgs ein Drittel aller rumänischen Banknoten. John Stoica verbrachte 1,5 Jahre im Gefängnis. 6. **Mutual Benefits Corporation**. Anlageverluste: 1,15 Milliarden Euro - Im Jahr 1994 gründete Joel Steinger die Mutual Benefits Corporation, obwohl die US-Börsenaufsichtsbehörde den Verkauf von Wertpapieren bereits verboten hatte. Die Vorgehensweise war folgende: Die Mutual Benefits Corporation kaufte Versicherungspolicen von Patienten mit unheilbaren Krankheiten, verkaufte sie an Dritte weiter und wurde zum Vermittler zwischen der Versicherungsgesellschaft und den neuen Eigentümern. Diese zahlten monatliche Beiträge und sollten im Gegenzug einen guten Prozentsatz der Sterbegeldzahlung erhalten. Das Unternehmen lieferte falsche Berichte über die Krankheiten der Versicherungsnehmer. Da jedoch kaum jemand tatsächlich starbst, wurden mit dem Geld neuer Investoren alte Investoren bezahlt. Im Jahr 2001 übergab ein Mitarbeiter von Mutual Benefits Informationen an die Polizei. Joel Steinger wurde daraufhin im Jahr 2014 zu 20 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. #### Platz 7: MAN – Schmiergeldauszahlungen in bar Dreist: Wer im Dienste der Volkswagentochter bis 2009 Kunden schmieren wollte, ließ sich die erforderliche Summe in bar an der Kasse auszahlen. Später verschleierte der Münchner Nutzfahrzeughersteller die Korruption mit Briefkastenfirmen und Scheinverträgen mit vermeintlichen Beratern in Slowenien und Liechtenstein. Die insgesamt rund 50 Millionen Schmiergelder schlug [MAN](https://www.produktion.de/schwerpunkte/mega-maschinen/man-und-basf-wollen-die-groesste-waermepumpe-der-welt-bauen-691.html) auf den Preis für seine Busse und Lkw drauf. So ließen sich die Münchner den Betrug von den Steuerzahlern in den Abnehmerstaaten finanzieren. Im Jahr 2009 flogen die Machenschaften auf. Die Affäre kostete MAN über 250 Millionen Euro – größter Posten war mit 150,6 Millionen Euro die Geldbuße der Staatsanwaltschaft. #### Platz 6: Scania - Rekord-Bußgeld für LKW-Kartell 1997 bis 2010 sprachen sich mehrere europäische LKW-Hersteller über Preise ab und über die Einführung neuer Emissionstechnologien sowie die Weitergabe der damit verbundenen Kosten. Die ersten Treffen der leitenden Manager:innen fanden in Brüssel und auf Messen statt. Später verlagerte sich die Organisation zu den Tochterunternehmen der deutschen Hersteller. MAN ließ das Kartell schließlich auffliegen und ging als Kronzeuge straffrei aus, während die anderen Hersteller Geldbußen zahlen mussten. DAF, Daimler Iveco und Volvo/Renault teilten sich eine Rekord-Kartellbuße von insgesamt 2,93 Milliarden Euro. Scania arbeitete nicht mit den Ermittlern zusammen und büßte deshalb in einem getrennten Verfahren mit 880 Millionen Euro. #### Platz 5: Siemens – Größter Schmiergeldskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte Am 15. November 2006 durchsuchen Fahnder Büros an 30 [Siemens](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft/175-jahre-siemens-vom-zeigertelegraf-zum-digitalisierer-337.html)-Standorten. Auch Privatwohnungen führender Manager des Konzerns blieben nicht unbehelligt. Sie finden Beweise für wenigstens 4.300 Schmiergeldzahlungen. Damit hatte sich der Elektronik- und Telekommunikationskonzern zwischen 1999 und 2006 Aufträge in Ägypten, Saudi-Arabien, Indonesien und Griechenland erkauft. Insgesamt 1,3 Milliarden Euro blätterten die Münchner dafür hin. Außerdem unterhielt der Dax-Konzern mit mehreren Hundert Millionen Euro gefüllte schwarze Kassen in Österreich, Liechtenstein und der Schweiz und machte sich so der Geldwäsche schuldig. Aufsichtsratchef Heinrich von Pierer und Vorstandsvorsitzender Klaus Kleinfeld müssen ihren Hut nehmen. Der Skandal kostet Siemens rund 2,9 Milliarden Euro an Strafen, Steuernachzahlungen und Anwaltskosten. ## Platz 4: Deutsche Bank - dienstbar für Geldwäsche im großen Stil Wenn es um Skandale geht, darf die Deutsche Bank nicht fehlen. Jahrelang drückte sie gern ein Auge zu, wenn es um verdächtige Geldflüsse ging und musste in den USA und Großbritannien deshalb diverse Strafen begleichen: 2017 zahlte sie 630 Millionen US-Dollar, weil sie verdächtigen Geldflüssen aus Russland nicht nachgegangen war. Zusätzlich kam im selben Jahr noch eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 41 Millionen US-Dollar dazu, weil sie Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche nicht eingehalten hatte. Dagegen ist die diesjährige Strafzahlung gar nicht so teuer: \"Nur\" 186 Millionen Dollar forderte die FED im Juli 2023 von der Bank - auch diesmal wegen ungenügender Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche. Es geht um die frühere Geschäftsbeziehung zur estnischen Tochter der Danske Bank. Die Danske Bank hatte in den Jahren 2008 bis 2016 diverse US-Banken betrogen und wurde in einem der größten US-Geldwäscheskandale zu einer Milliarden-Geldbuße verurteilt. Die Deutsche Bank wickelte verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von mehr als 267 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Danske Bank ab. #### Platz 3: Volkswagen-Dieselbetrug – Größter Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte In der Motorsteuerung von wenigstens elf Millionen Fahrzeugen verbaute Volkswagen bis 2015 illegale Abschalteinrichtungen. Damit ist „Dieselgate“ der größte Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte und ein schamloser Betrug an Kunden und Behörden. Verwickelt in die kriminellen Machenschaften sind fast alle Marken des Konzerns sowie der Zulieferer Bosch. Die Konzerntochter Audi soll bei der Entwicklung der verbotenen Software eine Vorreiterrolle gespielt haben. Der Dieselbetrug kostete den langjährigen [VW](https://www.produktion.de/rohstoffe/schrott/georgsmarienhuette-und-vw-recyceln-schrott-gemeinsam-617.html)-Chef Martin Winterkorn den Job. Ein Strafverfahren wegen möglicher Marktmanipulation gegen VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess und Aufsichtsratschef Hans Dieter Pötsch wurde gegen eine Zahlung von neun Millionen Euro eingestellt. Rupert Stadler wurde wegen Betrugs zu einer Bewährungsstrafe von einem Jahr und neun Monaten sowie einem Bußgeld von 1,1 Millionen Euro verurteilt. ## Platz 2: Wirecard - spektakulärster Bilanzskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte An der Geschäftspraxis und den Bilanzzahlen des deutschen Fintech-Hoffnungsträgers Wirecard kamen schon mehr als ein Jahrzehnt vor der Insolvenz Zweifel auf, aber die Firma schaffte es trotzdem in den Dax. Im Jahr 2019 deckt ein Bericht der britischen Zeitung \\'Financial Times\\' Unregelmäßigkeiten bei Geschäften in Singapur auf. Nach einigem Hin und Her kam 2020 der jähe Absturz des Unternehmens, als klar wurde, dass auf Treuhandkonten 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlen. CEO Markus Braun trat zurück und wurde festgenommen, während Vorstandsmitglied Jan Marsalek unter einem Vorwand das Land verließ und die Flucht ergriff. Am 25. Juni 2020 meldete der Dax-Konzern Insolvenz an. Es stellte sich heraus, dass wesentliche Teile des Geschäfts tatsächlich nie stattgefunden hatten. Der damalige Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz geriet unter Druck, weil die ihm unterstellte Bafin trotz aller Hinweise wenig gegen den Zahlungsdienstleister unternommen hatte. 2022 begann der Strafprozess gegen Markus Braun, Oliver Bellenhaus und den ehemaligen Wirecard-Chefbuchhalter. Sie sind angeklagt wegen Marktmanipulation, Untreue, falscher Darstellung und gewerbsmäßigen Bandenbetrugs. Marsalek wäre sicherlich mit auf der Anklagebank, ist aber bis heute flüchtig und wird mit internationalem Haftbefehl gesucht. Im Juli 2023 meldete er sich mit einem Brief beim Landgericht München, welcher Braun entlasten sollte. Zeugenaussagen zeichneten im Prozess das Bild eines Konzerns, in dem es chaotisch zuging und der Vorstand kein besonderes Interesse an der Rechtstreue zeigte. Auch die Firmenkultur ließ wohl zu wünschen übrig: \"Pornografie war ganz normal bei uns\", gab ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter der internen Revision im Zeugenstand zu Protokoll. Brauns Anwälte versuchten unterdessen mit 450 Beweisanträgen zu belegen, dass Marsalek und Kronzeuge Bellenhaus sowie zahlreiche Mittäter die Schuld tragen, während Braun ahnungslos war. Ob sie das Gericht überzeugen können? Aktuell zeichnet sich erstmal eine Verlängerung der Verhandlung ab. Für diesen filmreifen Skandal gibt es hier im Ranking Platz 2. #### Platz 1: Cum-Ex-Skandal – Größter Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Die kriminelle Energie deutscher Banken und ihrer Anleger kennt keine Grenzen. Mit „Cum-Ex“- und „Cum-Cum“-Wertpapiertransaktionen zwischen mehreren Anlegern rundum den Dividendenstichtag einer Aktie verwirrten die Kreditinstitute von 2005 bis 2011 gezielt den Fiskus. So sehr, dass Finanzbeamte am Schluss nicht mehr erkennen konnten, welcher Bankkunde auf die Ausschüttung Kapitalertragsteuer gezahlt hatte, und welcher nicht. So konnten sich auch Anleger die Steuer zurückerstatten lassen, die sie gar nicht bezahlt hatten. Insgesamt prellten Banken und Aktionäre den deutschen Steuerzahler so um bis zu 32 Milliarden Euro – der größte Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik. *Überarbeitet von Julia Dusold und Dagmar Merger (14.08.2023)* ## Sie möchten gerne weiterlesen? ### Jetzt kostenlos registrieren oder einloggen: Newsletter-Anmeldung Bleiben Sie zu allen Themen, Trends und Innovationen der Branche informiert. ## Auch interessant ## Aktuelle Beiträge [Wirtschaft](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft.html) 15.

Il est essentiel que les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière en comprennent les subtilités. ### Définition et principes de base du blanchiment d’argent Le blanchiment d’argent est le processus qui consiste à faire paraître légal le produit de l’argent illégal. Il s’agit d’une méthode utilisée par les criminels pour dissimuler leurs activités et l’argent en jeu, en faisant apparaître le produit de leurs crimes comme légitime. Cela se fait souvent par le biais d’une séquence complexe de virements bancaires ou de transactions commerciales, ce qui rend difficile le traçage de la source d’origine des fonds. Parmi les exemples bien documentés de blanchiment d’argent, citons l’utilisation d’espèces pour acheter des polices d’assurance-vie et les laisser ensuite expirer, l’achat et la vente d’actifs de valeur comme des œuvres d’art, et l’utilisation de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) pour dissimuler la propriété et le transfert de fonds, en particulier dans le secteur immobilier. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services dans le [cadre du blanchiment d’argent axé sur le commerce](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce\") et l’utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) sont également des méthodes courantes utilisées pour blanchir de l’argent. ### Les étapes du blanchiment d’argent Comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) est crucial pour détecter et prévenir cette activité illicite. Ces étapes comprennent généralement le placement, la superposition et l’intégration. **Placement** : Il s’agit du processus d’introduction de l’argent illicite dans le système financier. Cela peut être fait en divisant de grandes quantités d’argent en petites sommes moins visibles qui sont ensuite déposées directement dans un compte bancaire, ou en achetant une série d’instruments (tels que des chèques ou des mandats) qui sont ensuite collectés et déposés dans des comptes à un autre endroit. **Superposition** : À ce stade, le blanchisseur d’argent s’engage généralement dans une série de conversions ou de mouvements des fonds pour les éloigner de leur source. La superposition peut consister en plusieurs virements bancaires, des virements bancaires entre différents comptes à des noms différents dans différents pays, des dépôts et des retraits pour faire varier continuellement le montant d’argent sur les comptes, changer la devise de l’argent et acheter des articles de grande valeur (tels que des maisons ou des entreprises) pour changer la forme de l’argent. C’est ce qu’on appelle parfois [la superposition complexe](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). **Intégration** : La dernière étape du processus. Au [stade de l’intégration](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/), l’argent réintègre l’économie traditionnelle sous une forme d’apparence légitime – il semble provenir d’une transaction légale. Il peut s’agir d’un virement bancaire final sur le compte d’une entreprise locale dans laquelle le blanchisseur « investit » en échange d’une part des bénéfices, de la vente d’une propriété achetée pendant la phase de superposition ou simplement de la dépense d’argent qui a été blanchi pour des produits de luxe. En comprenant les bases du blanchiment d’argent et ses étapes, les professionnels peuvent mieux s’outiller pour détecter et prévenir ces activités, qui sont des aspects cruciaux de la [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ## Regarder des exemples concrets Pour mieux comprendre la dynamique du blanchiment d’argent, penchons-nous sur des exemples concrets. Ces affaires, impliquant l’assurance-vie, le monde de l’art et les sociétés écrans dans l’immobilier, dévoilent les stratégies complexes employées pour dissimuler des fonds illicites. ### Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’assurance-vie L’une des méthodes de blanchiment d’argent consiste à souscrire des polices d’assurance-vie. Les particuliers utilisent de l’argent comptant pour acheter ces polices, puis empruntent sur celles-ci et finissent par laisser les polices expirer. Cette méthode circulaire obscurcit l’origine des fonds et donne un vernis de légitimité à l’argent illicite ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Cet exemple souligne l’importance des procédures de [connaissance du client (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) et de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle dans le secteur de l’assurance en tant qu’éléments clés de [la conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ### Le blanchiment d’argent dans le monde de l’art Le monde de l’art est un autre domaine vulnérable au blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent et vendent des œuvres d’art de valeur pour masquer l’origine de l’argent utilisé dans ces transactions. La valeur élevée des œuvres d’art, associée à la nature subjective de leur prix, en fait un terrain fertile pour les stratagèmes de blanchiment d’argent. Cela met en évidence la nécessité de contrôles rigoureux et de transparence dans les transactions d’œuvres d’art de grande valeur. ### Sociétés fictives et biens immobiliers Les transactions immobilières, en particulier celles impliquant [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), sont un autre canal courant de blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent souvent des biens immobiliers en utilisant de l’argent comptant et dissimulent leur propriété par le biais de sociétés fictives ou de propriétés cachées afin d’obscurcir la piste des fonds et de compliquer la recherche de leurs origines illicites ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dans certains cas, les évaluations immobilières sont manipulées et les criminels collaborent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette pratique illicite leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Dans un cas notable, un Hondurien a blanchi plus d’un million de dollars de pots-de-vin par virement bancaire international pour acheter des propriétés à la Nouvelle-Orléans, y compris des espaces de bureaux ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Dans un autre cas, une banque privée aurait permis à un compte appartenant au Vatican de dépenser 350 millions de dollars pour investir dans l’immobilier londonien, facilitant ainsi les transactions immobilières illégales, y compris celles effectuées par des trafiquants de drogue pour acheter des propriétés en Bulgarie ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Ces exemples illustrent l’importance de la transparence des [bénéficiaires effectifs](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans les transactions immobilières et la nécessité de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur. Ils soulignent également les défis auxquels sont confrontés les organismes chargés de l’application de la loi pour retracer les flux de fonds illicites et le rôle central des [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) dans les systèmes de blanchiment d’argent. ## Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce est une forme complexe de criminalité financière qui utilise des transactions commerciales pour cacher, déplacer et investir de l’argent gagné illicitement. C’est l’une des trois méthodes fondamentales de blanchiment d’argent, avec la superposition et l’intégration, qui peuvent toutes être explorées dans notre article sur les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/). ### Fausse déclaration de biens ou de services Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce consiste à faire de fausses déclarations sur le prix, la quantité ou la qualité de biens ou de services afin de transférer de la valeur entre les pays et de dissimuler la source illicite des fonds ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Cette méthode peut être utilisée à la fois à [l’étape de la stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour créer des couches complexes de transactions et à [l’étape d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour réintroduire l’argent blanchi dans l’économie légitime. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services peut prendre plusieurs formes, telles que la surfacturation, la sous-facturation, la facturation multiple ou la description mensongère de biens ou de services. Ces pratiques frauduleuses sont souvent facilitées par [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) et des structures de [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dissimulées, ce qui peut rendre difficile pour les autorités de détecter ces activités et d’enquêter sur celles-ci. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent lié au commerce Un exemple notable de blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce concerne une organisation criminelle qui utilise des biens sous-évalués et de fausses factures pour blanchir 1,8 million de dollars d’argent sale ([ONUDC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). Dans ce cas, l’organisation a acheté des biens dans un pays à bas prix, puis les a vendus dans un autre pays à un prix beaucoup plus élevé. La différence de prix a été utilisée pour blanchir l’argent illicite. Cette affaire nous rappelle brutalement l’importance de solides procédures de [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) , y compris une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard de la clientèle et une surveillance continue des transactions. En comprenant les techniques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce, les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux identifier et [atténuer les risques](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Atténuer les risques\") associés à ce type d’activité illicite. Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent mettent en évidence la nécessité d’une vigilance continue et de contrôles efficaces dans le secteur du commerce mondial. Alors que les méthodes utilisées par les criminels continuent d’évoluer, il est crucial pour les organisations de rester informées et d’adapter leurs stratégies [de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent\") en conséquence. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent, les professionnels peuvent mieux protéger leurs organisations et contribuer à la lutte mondiale contre la criminalité financière. ## Utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires Les entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) jouent un rôle crucial dans le système financier mondial, offrant des services tels que le transfert d’argent, le change de devises et l’encaissement de chèques. Cependant, l’utilisation abusive des ESM est devenue une préoccupation importante dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, car ces entreprises peuvent faciliter le mouvement de fonds sans examen ou surveillance réglementaire appropriés ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Transmetteurs d’argent non enregistrés Dans le contexte du blanchiment d’argent, les criminels exploitent souvent des émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés, un sous-ensemble d’ESM, pour transférer des fonds illicites sans attirer l’attention des autorités ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces entités non enregistrées opèrent sous le radar, contournant les réglementations strictes et les procédures de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle auxquelles les institutions financières traditionnelles sont soumises. Les transferts effectués par l’intermédiaire de ces ESM non inscrites peuvent ne pas laisser de traces, ce qui rend difficile la reconstitution de la source d’origine ou de la destination finale des fonds. Cela en fait un canal idéal pendant la [phase de stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/), où l’objectif est de dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites. La relative facilité et l’anonymat offerts par les émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés les rendent attrayants pour les criminels, qui utilisent ces services pour transférer de l’argent au-delà des frontières sans être détectés. Il s’agit d’un défi de taille pour les efforts [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le monde entier. ### Études de cas d’utilisation abusive d’ESM L’utilisation abusive des ESM n’est malheureusement pas rare, avec de nombreux cas enregistrés à travers le monde. Par exemple, les criminels sont connus pour utiliser les ESM pour blanchir de l’argent provenant d’activités illégales telles que le trafic de drogue, la fraude et le crime organisé. Dans de nombreux cas, ces fonds illicites transitent par des ESM non enregistrées, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de détecter et de retracer les transactions. L’utilisation abusive des ESM est un rappel brutal de l’importance d’une surveillance réglementaire rigoureuse dans le secteur financier. Il souligne la nécessité de mettre en place des procédures efficaces de [connaissance du client (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) un suivi rigoureux des transactions et une diligence raisonnable approfondie pour prévenir de tels abus. La lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent est continue, avec de nouvelles méthodes et techniques qui émergent constamment. En comprenant et en tirant des leçons de ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/), les organismes de réglementation, les responsables de la conformité et les institutions financières peuvent mieux s’équiper pour détecter et prévenir les flux d’argent illicites à l’avenir. ## Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’immobilier Les transactions immobilières offrent aux criminels un moyen efficace de blanchir des fonds illicites. Les transactions de grande valeur du secteur, combinées aux montages juridiques et financiers souvent complexes qu’elles impliquent, représentent une opportunité intéressante pour les criminels qui cherchent à légitimer leurs gains mal acquis. ### Achat et vente d’une propriété Une méthode courante employée par les criminels consiste à acheter des biens immobiliers en espèces, puis à dissimuler leur propriété par le biais de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) ou de propriétés cachées ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Cette méthode obscurcit la piste des fonds et complique la recherche de leurs origines illicites, ce qui pose des défis aux organismes d’application de la loi. Une autre stratégie consiste à manipuler les évaluations immobilières. Les criminels collaborent souvent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette tactique leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Les criminels établissent également des sociétés fictives dans des juridictions étrangères pour posséder des biens immobiliers, ce qui facilite le mouvement transfrontalier de fonds illicites. Cette méthode rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux de fonds, ce qui démontre une méthode utilisée pour dissimuler des activités de blanchiment d’argent. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent immobilier Le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur immobilier est un problème mondial. Selon un rapport de Global Financial Integrity (GFI), plus de 2,3 milliards de dollars ont été blanchis dans l’immobilier américain entre 2015 et 2021. Cela montre à quel point l’immobilier reste l’un des moyens les plus populaires de transférer des fonds illicites. Autre exemple, au cours de la dernière décennie, environ 20 milliards de dollars sont entrés sur le marché immobilier dans la région du Grand Toronto au Canada sans que les autorités de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ne fassent l’objet [d’un examen minutieux (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Région | Quantité blanchie (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | États-Unis | 2,3 milliards de dollars | | Grand Toronto, Canada | 20 milliards de dollars | Ces exemples soulignent l’importance de la vigilance et de la conformité efficace en [matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le secteur immobilier. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées par les criminels et en étant conscients des [signaux d’alarme](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Signaux d’alarme\"), les professionnels du secteur immobilier peuvent jouer un rôle essentiel dans la perturbation de ces flux financiers illicites. Pour ceux qui travaillent dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière, comprendre ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) peut aider à identifier les risques potentiels et à mettre en œuvre des procédures efficaces [de diligence raisonnable à l’égard de la clientèle](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) . ## Scandales de blanchiment d’argent Même avec la mise en place de mesures strictes [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) et de contrôles réglementaires, des cas de blanchiment d’argent à grande échelle continuent de faire surface. Examinons quelques scandales notables de blanchiment d’argent qui ont fait la une des journaux ces dernières années. ### La fuite des fichiers FinCEN En 2020, la fuite des FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) Files a révélé un vaste réseau de corruption financière. Plus de 400 journalistes de 88 pays ont collaboré à cette enquête, découvrant un montant stupéfiant de 2 000 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes. Ces fichiers secrets contenaient des informations sur des transactions signalées comme suspectes par les banques, mais qui ont été autorisées à se poursuivre. Le rapport a mis en évidence de graves défaillances dans les systèmes bancaires mondiaux, permettant de transférer d’importantes sommes d’argent sans contrôles adéquats. La fuite des FinCEN Files a souligné l’importance d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et d’une application rigoureuse des réglementations [KYC (Know Your Customer).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) L’affaire est un rappel brutal de l’ampleur et de la complexité potentielles des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. ### La fuite des Panama Papers La fuite des Panama Papers en 2016 a été une révélation monumentale qui a révélé de nombreux cas très médiatisés de blanchiment d’argent, d’évasion fiscale et de contournement des sanctions internationales. La fuite a impliqué des banques, des cabinets d’avocats et des personnalités de premier plan dans le monde entier, révélant l’étendue des activités financières illicites dissimulées par le biais de [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) et de [sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/). Les Panama Papers ont mis en évidence l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives anonymes pour dissimuler la [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/), une tactique courante dans la [phase de superposition du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). En conséquence, le scandale a suscité des appels à une plus grande transparence dans les services financiers offshore et à une réglementation plus stricte pour identifier les bénéficiaires effectifs. ### Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka Le scandale de la « Troïka Laundromat » a impliqué le blanchiment de 4,6 milliards de dollars par le biais d’un réseau de fausses entreprises et de transactions financières illicites entre 2006 et 2013. Ce stratagème a impliqué de multiples parties dans différentes juridictions, ce qui montre la portée mondiale des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka a mis en lumière l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives pour dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites, une tactique courante dans la [phase d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/). Le scandale a donné lieu à des enquêtes et à des actions en justice, soulignant davantage l’importance de la coopération mondiale dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. Chacun de ces scandales souligne l’importance de mesures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et la nécessité constante de faire preuve de vigilance et d’application de la loi. En étudiant ces « exemples de blanchiment d’argent », les professionnels de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux comprendre les tactiques employées par les blanchisseurs d’argent et la façon de détecter et de prévenir ces activités illicites. ## Tirer les leçons des affaires de blanchiment d’argent Comprendre des scénarios du monde réel est l’un des moyens les plus efficaces de comprendre le processus complexe du blanchiment d’argent. Cette section examine de plus près certains des exemples de blanchiment d’argent les plus significatifs de l’histoire récente afin de fournir des informations précieuses sur la façon dont ces événements se sont déroulés et les leçons apprises. ### L’affaire Wachovia Bank En 2010, la Wachovia Bank a été impliquée dans une importante opération de blanchiment d’argent impliquant des cartels de la drogue mexicains. Entre 2004 et 2007, la banque a facilité le blanchiment de près de 390 milliards de dollars par l’intermédiaire de ses succursales. Les fonds illicites, glanés lors de la vente de drogue aux États-Unis, ont été passés en contrebande à travers la frontière mexicaine et ont ensuite été retournés sur les comptes américains de Wachovia. La banque n’a pas vérifié l’origine de ces fonds, manquant ainsi à ses obligations en matière de [connaissance du client (KYC).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) Au lieu de poursuites, Wachovia a payé une amende de 160 millions de dollars et s’est engagé à améliorer ses [procédures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AML).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) ### L’affaire de la Standard Chartered Bank La Standard Chartered Bank s’est heurtée à de lourdes sanctions pour des violations répétées des sanctions américaines. Initialement condamnée à une amende de 670 millions de dollars en 2012 pour des violations impliquant l’Iran, la banque a de nouveau été accusée en 2019 d’ignorer les sanctions contre des pays tels que le Zimbabwe, la Birmanie, l’Iran, le Soudan, Cuba et la Syrie. Pour ces infractions, les autorités américaines et britanniques ont infligé à Standard Chartered une amende totale de 1,1 milliard de dollars, soulignant les graves conséquences du non-respect du droit international. ### L’affaire Danske Bank La succursale estonienne de Danske Bank a servi d’intermédiaire pour environ 228 milliards de dollars de fonds blanchis entre 2007 et 2015. Ce scandale, impliquant des milliers de clients suspects, a attiré l’attention du public sur les manquements de la banque en matière de conformité. Les autorités danoises ont infligé des amendes d’un montant total de 2 millions de dollars et ont attribué la faute à plusieurs responsables de la banque. ### L’affaire BCCI La Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) s’est livrée à des activités de fraude et de [blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) totalisant jusqu’à 23 milliards de dollars américains. La BCCI a utilisé des stratagèmes sophistiqués de blanchiment d’argent tels que [des sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), des paradis fiscaux, des commissions et des pots-de-vin. La fermeture de la banque en 1991 a donné lieu à de nombreuses actions en justice, notamment la poursuite de la Banque d’Angleterre par la BCCI pour négligence dans l’identification des signes avant-coureurs. Cette affaire met en évidence l’importance de solides programmes de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment [d’argent (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)).

Juli 2024 - 22 Minuten Lesezeit **[Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/wie-funktioniert-geldwaesche/)** – ein Begriff, der längst nicht nur in Kriminalromanen auftaucht, sondern reale und tiefgreifende Konsequenzen für Wirtschaftssysteme weltweit darstellt. Insbesondere **Deutschland** hat sich, vielleicht unerwartet für viele, zu einem wahren Hotspot bzw. **Geldwäscheparadies** entwickelt. In diesem Artikel widmen wir uns den zentralen Fragen: **Warum** ist Deutschland zu einem Eldorado für Geldwäsche avanciert? **Wie** schneidet die Bundesrepublik im europäischen Vergleich ab, und **welche** **Folgen** hat das Geldwäscheparadies Deutschland für die Wirtschaft und den Finanzsektor? Die Antworten auf diese Fragen sind vielschichtig und führen uns in die Tiefen des internationalen Finanzwesens, zu Schwachstellen in nationalen Rechtssystemen und den politischen wie ökonomischen Dynamiken, die Deutschland in dieser Rolle festigen. Wir betrachten die **Hintergründe**, die strukturellen Probleme und die Verstrickungen, die Deutschland zur Zieladresse für schmutziges Geld machen. Zudem stellen wir die **Strategien und Maßnahmen** vor, die auf nationaler und europäischer Ebene ergriffen werden, um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzuwirken und zeigen auf, **welche Schritte** noch notwendig sind, um effektive Kontrollmechanismen zu etablieren. Inhalt [Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788086) [Europäischer Vergleich](#t-1722253788087) [Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788088) [Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788089) ## Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### Gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen Deutschland verfügt über **umfangreiche gesetzliche Bestimmungen** zur Bekämpfung der [Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/phasen-der-geldwaesche/), darunter das [Geldwäschegesetz (GwG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/), die [6 Geldwäscherichtlinien](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) sowie [§ 261 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__261.html). Trotz dieser Regulatorien gibt es Schwächen in der Umsetzung. Die Verfolgung von Geldwäschefällen hängt stark von der **Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Behörden** wie Polizei, Finanzbehörden und der Justiz ab. Eine häufige Kritik ist, dass es zu lange dauert, bis verdächtige Aktivitäten untersucht und rechtlich verfolgt werden. Zudem fehlen oft klare Vorgaben für die präventive Eindämmung illegaler Vermögensumwandlung in bestimmten Branchen, wie z.B. im Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel. ### Finanzaufsicht und Kontrolle Die [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/pflicht-zur-bestellung-eines-geldwaeschebeauftragten/) in Deutschland steht zunehmend in der Kritik, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die **Zuständigkeiten und die Effizienz der Aufsichtsbehörden**. Während die **Bundesanstalt für Finanz-dienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin)**für den Finanzsektor zuständig ist, liegen die Aufsichtspflichten für andere Bereiche wie z.B. Autohäuser, Immobilienmakler, Juweliere etc. bei den lokalen Aufsichtsbehörden. Dieses System führt zu einem **\"Flickenteppich\"** an undurchsichtigen Zuständigkeiten, was die Wirksamkeit der Geldwäschebekämpfung erheblich beeinträchtigt. Zusätzlich sorgt die **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)**, die zentrale Meldestelle für Verdachtsmeldungen, für massive Kritik. Der FIU wird Fach- und Knowhow-Mangel sowie ein erheblicher Personalmangel vorgeworfen. Dies führt dazu, dass viele Verdachtsmeldungen nicht zeitnah bearbeitet werden können. Die ineffiziente Struktur und mangelnde Ressourcen der FIU schwächen die Geldwäscheprävention und lassen Kriminellen zu viel Spielraum. ### Banken und Finanzdienstleister **Banken und andere Finanzinstitute** sind **Schlüsselakteure** im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Sie sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, Verdachtsmeldungen über fragwürdige Transaktionen abzugeben und interne Kontrollen zur Prävention von Finanzwäsche durchzuführen. Dennoch gibt es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Banken ihrer **Sorgfaltspflicht** nicht nachkommen. Ursachen hierfür sind oft unzureichende interne Kontrollen, mangelnde Schulung des Personals oder bewusstes Ignorieren von Vorschriften. Große Banken sind häufig in Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, was zeigt, dass trotz bestehender Regelungen die praktische Umsetzung mangelhaft ist. ### Hohe Bargeldnutzung Deutschland hat traditionell eine **hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen**. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. Dies führt zu mehreren spezifischen Schwächen: #### **Anonymität der Transaktionen** * Bargeldtransaktionen sind anonym und hinterlassen keine digitalen Spuren, was es den Strafverfolgungsbehörden erschwert, die Herkunft und den Fluss der Gelder nachzuverfolgen. Dies macht Bargeld zu einem bevorzugten Mittel für Kriminelle, die illegale Gelder waschen möchten. #### ****Mangelnde Transparenz**** * Große Bargeldtransaktionen sind weniger transparent als elektronische Transaktionen. Selbst wenn solche Transaktionen gemeldet werden müssen, ist es schwieriger, verdächtige Muster zu erkennen und zu analysieren. Dies führt zu Lücken in der Prüfung und Erkennung von Geldwäscheaktivitäten. #### ******Erschwerte Durchsetzung von Gesetzen****** * Die hohen Bargeldnutzungsraten erschweren die Durchsetzung von Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetzen. Während Banken und andere Finanzinstitute strengen Regulierungen und Meldepflichten unterliegen, sind Bargeldtransaktionen oft weniger reguliert, insbesondere wenn sie außerhalb formaler Finanzinstitute stattfinden. ### Kritische Sektoren: ### ### Immobilien, Kunst- und Auktionshäuser, Autohäuser Bestimmte [Sektoren](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/warnung-vor-neuer-betrugsmasche-fuer-gwg-relevante-haendler/) sind besonders anfällig für Geldwäsche, darunter der **Immobiliensektor, Kunst-** und **Auktionshäuser** sowie **Autohäuser**. Diese Sektoren bieten aufgrund hoher Transaktionssummen und oftmals unzureichender Überwachung ideale Bedingungen für die Umwandlung illegaler Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte. #### **Immobiliensektor** Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt ist besonders anfällig für \"schmutziges\" Geld. **Große Bargeldtransaktionen** und **komplexe Eigentumsstrukturen** machen es schwierig, die Herkunft von Geldern nachzuverfolgen. In Städten wie Berlin, Hamburg und München wird der Immobilienmarkt oft genutzt, um Schwarzgeld zu waschen. Der Erwerb von Luxusimmobilien oder die Investition in Bauprojekte sind gängige Methoden, um illegale Gelder in den legalen Wirtschaftskreislauf einzuschleusen. Seit dem **1. April 2023** gibt es zwar in Deutschland ein **Bargeldverbot beim Immobilienkauf (**[**§ 59 Abs. 11 GwG**](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/__59.html)**)**, um die Finanzwäsche einzudämmen, dennoch bleibt die Umsetzung und Überwachung dieser Regelungen eine Herausforderung. #### **Kunst- und Auktionshäuser** Der Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel ist ein weiterer Sektor, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Hier **fehlen oft klare Vorgaben und Meldepflichten**, die eine wirksame Überwachung und Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen ermöglichen würden. Es gibt **keine** flächendeckende, verpflichtende **Registrierung** **und Lizenzierung** von Kunst- und Antiquitätenhändlern, was die systematische Überwachung erschwert. Für **Transaktionen über 10.000 Euro** bestehen jedoch **Meldepflichten**, die häufig nicht konsequent umgesetzt werden. Kunsthändler und Auktionshäuser sind verpflichtet, bei hochpreisigen Transaktionen die Herkunft der Gelder und die Identität der Käufer umfassend zu überprüfen und zu dokumentieren. #### **Autohäuser** Autohäuser sind ebenfalls ein kritischer Sektor, da hier **hohe Summen in bar** bezahlt werden können, um illegale Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte umzuwandeln. In Deutschland gilt eine **Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro für Fahrzeugkäufe**. Transaktionen, die diesen Betrag überschreiten, müssen dokumentiert und die am Kauf Beteiligten müssen identifiziert werden. Trotz dieser Regelungen gibt es oft Lücken in der Überwachung und Durchsetzung, was die Kontrolle und Dokumentation solcher Transaktionen erschwert. ### Unternehmen und Steueroasen Viele Unternehmen nutzen **komplexe Firmenstrukturen**, darunter auch Briefkastenfirmen bzw. allgemein Offshore-Konstrukte, um Geldwäsche zu betreiben. **Offshore-Konstrukte** sind rechtliche und finanzielle Strukturen, die in Ländern oder Gebieten mit günstigen Steuer- und Regulierungsgesetzen (z.B. Bulgarien, Luxemburg, Schweiz, Malta...) eingerichtet werden. Diese Gebiete werden oft als Steueroasen bezeichnet. Solche Konstrukte beinhalten häufig die **Gründung von****Briefkastenfirmen oder Tochtergesellschaften**, die hauptsächlich dazu dienen, steuerliche Vorteile zu nutzen und die Herkunft von Geldern zu verschleiern. Diese Strukturen erschweren die Nachverfolgung illegaler Gelder erheblich. Deutschland hat zwar Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Nutzung solcher Konstrukte zu bekämpfen, jedoch bleiben internationale Verflechtungen ein großes Hindernis. Steueroasen bieten weiterhin **Schlupflöcher für Unternehmen**, die illegale Gelder verstecken oder waschen möchten. Die Transparenz und Offenlegung von Unternehmensstrukturen ist daher ein zentraler Punkt im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Um Geldwäsche in Deutschland effektiv zu bekämpfen, müssen die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen kontinuierlich verbessert werden. Eine stärkere internationale Zusammenarbeit und gezielte Maßnahmen zur Überwachung der kritischen Branchen und der Finanzinstitute sind unerlässlich. Nur durch eine umfassende und koordinierte Strategie kann die Geldwäsche nachhaltig eingedämmt werden. **Schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen vor **Geldwäsche-Risiken**!** Fordern Sie noch heute Ihre kostenlose Erstberatung an und profitieren Sie von unserer langjährigen Expertise im Bereich der Geldwäscheprävention. [Jetzt Beratungsgespräch sichern](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/anfrage/) ## Europäischer Vergleich Die **Gesetzgebung** zur Bannung der Geldwäsche **variiert in Europa erheblich**. Während einige Länder strenge Regulierungen und effektive Durchsetzungsmechanismen implementiert haben, stehen andere noch vor massiven Herausforderungen. In diesem Abschnitt vergleichen wir die Ansätze mehrerer europäischer Länder und analysieren, wie **Deutschland im Vergleich** abschneidet. ### **Länder mit besonders zielführenden Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche** **Die Niederlande** gelten als Vorreiter in der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Sie haben ein zentrales Meldesystem für verdächtige Transaktionen, das von der Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-NL) verwaltet wird. Dieses System ermöglicht eine schnelle Erkennung und Verfolgung dubioser Aktivitäten. Die enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden trägt maßgeblich zum Erfolg bei. * Zentrales Meldesystem, enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden * Trotz strenger Regulierungen Probleme bei der Abwehr grenzüberschreitender Geldwäsche **Frankreich** hat ebenfalls umfangreiche Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung der Geldwäsche eingeführt. Die französische Finanzaufsichtsbehörde, Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), und Tracfin, eine spezielle Einheit zum Kampf gegen Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung, überwachen und regulieren Finanztransaktionen streng. Frankreich ist bekannt für seine konsequente Strafverfolgung und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von EU-Richtlinien zur Geldwäschereduzierung. * Strenge Kontrolle und konsequente Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinien * Komplikationen bei der Beaufsichtigung von [Kryptowährungen](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/kryptowaehrungen-und-geldwaeschepraevention/) und neuen Finanztechnologien **Das Vereinigte Königreich** hat einige der strengsten Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetze in Europa. Die National Crime Agency (NCA) und die Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) spielen eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Überwachung und Durchsetzung. Großbritannien hat strenge Meldepflichten und umfassende Maßnahmen zur Überprüfung und Verifizierung von Kundenidentitäten eingeführt. * Strenge Gesetze und rigorose Nachverfolgung durch NCA und FCA * London als globales Finanzzentrum bleibt Hotspot für Geldwäscheaktivitäten ### **Länder mit großen Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung** **Deutschland** hat, wie bereits oben erwähnt, in den letzten Jahren seine Gesetze zur Abwehr der Geldwäsche verschärft. Trotz dieser Fortschritte wird Deutschland oft kritisiert. Die FIU wird bzgl. Fach-, Knowhow- und Personalmangel bemängelt. Ebenso die Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) steht aufgrund begrenzter Ressourcen und komplexer Finanzströme vor einigen Hürden. Insbesondere in den bereits genannten Sektoren und bei der Beobachtung von Nichtfinanzunternehmen (\"Flickenteppich\") herrscht Ineffizienz der Behörden. Zudem hat Deutschland traditionell eine hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. * Umfassende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen * Ineffizienz der Behörden, Personalmangel, allg. hohe Bargeldnutzung Obwohl die **Schweiz** kein EU-Mitglied ist, spielt sie eine bedeutende Rolle im europäischen Finanzsystem. Die Schweiz hat in den letzten Jahren ihre Gesetze zum Widerstand gegen Geldwäsche verschärft und arbeitet eng mit internationalen Organisationen zusammen. Die Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA) überwacht Finanzinstitute und sorgt für die Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften. Die Schweiz bleibt jedoch aufgrund ihrer Bankgeheimnisse, attraktiven Steuerregelungen und ihrer sogenannten Zollfreigrenzen ein Hotspot für illegale Geldströme. * Enge Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen Organisationen und verschärfte Gesetze * Bankgeheimnis, attraktive Steuerregelungen und Zollfreigrenzen fördern Geldwäsche **Italien** hat mit erheblichen Hindernissen im Bereich der Geldwäsche zu kämpfen, insbesondere durch die Präsenz der Mafia und anderer krimineller Organisationen. Die italienische Regierung hat eine Vielzahl von Gesetzen und Regulierungen eingeführt, um Geldwäsche zu bekämpfen, darunter die Einrichtung der Anti-Mafia-Direktion (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, DIA). Trotz dieser Maßnahmen bleibt die konsequente Umsetzung ein ständiges Problem. * Einrichtung spezialisierter Anti-Mafia-Einheiten * Starke Präsenz der Mafia und ineffektive Umsetzung von Gesetzen ### **Fazit des Vergleichs** Ein Vergleich der europäischen Länder zeigt, dass **jedes Land gewisse Stärke und Schwächen** bei der Geldwäschebeseitigung aufweist, aber Staaten wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich und das Vereinigte Königreich** insgesamt **sehr erfolgreiche Maßnahmen** zur Geldwäscheneutralisierung implementiert haben. Diese Länder setzen auf enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Behörden und Finanzinstituten, strenge Regulierungen und beharrliche Strafverfolgung.Länder wie die **Schweiz und Italien** hingegen stehen hier vor **enormeren Stolpersteinen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter verbessern, um Geldwäsche entgegenzuwirken. **Deutschland** zeigt durch die stetige Verschärfung der gesetzlichen Regularien zwar einen **guten Ansatz**, muss jedoch ebenso seine Maßnahmen optimieren, insbesondere im Bereich der personellen Ausstattung und der Inspektion der kritischen Sektoren. ## Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche hat **erhebliche wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen für Deutschland**. Durch das Einfließen von illegalem Geld in die Wirtschaft werden Marktmechanismen verzerrt. Investitionen in Immobilien, Kunst und Luxusgüter mit illegalen Geldern können die Preise in diesen Märkten künstlich in die Höhe treiben. Dies kann zu einer Blase führen, die bei ihrem Platzen erhebliche **wirtschaftliche Schäden** verursachen kann. Außerdem **entgehen dem Staat** durch Geldwäsche **erhebliche Steuereinnahmen**, die sonst für öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Infrastrukturprojekte verwendet werden könnten. ### **Soziale und politische Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche **untergräbt das Vertrauen der Bürger in staatliche Institutionen und den Finanzsektor**. Wenn illegale Aktivitäten ungestraft bleiben, entsteht der Eindruck, dass Kriminalität nicht effektiv bekämpft wird und dass Gesetze nicht für alle gleichermaßen gelten. Dies kann zu sozialem Unmut und einem Rückgang der gesellschaftlichen Moral führen. Politisch kann dies Druck auf die Regierung ausüben, strengere Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, was wiederum die **politische Stabilität** beeinflussen kann. ### **Rechtliche Folgen** Die **rechtlichen Konsequenzen** illegaler Geldtransaktionen sind **weitreichend**. Individuen und Unternehmen, die der Geldwäsche überführt werden, sehen sich erheblichen Strafen gegenüber, einschließlich **hoher Geldstrafen** und **langjährigen Gefängnisstrafen**. Darüber hinaus können Unternehmen ihre **Geschäftslizenzen verlieren**, was ihre Fähigkeit, international zu operieren, stark einschränkt. Prominente Fälle zeigen, dass die Justiz zunehmend härter gegen Geldwäscher vorgeht. ### **Internationale Reputation** Geldwäsche hat auch starke **Auswirkungen auf die** **internationale Reputation Deutschlands**. Wenn ein Land als „Geldwäscheparadies“ angesehen wird, kann dies das **Vertrauen** **internationaler Investoren und Geschäftspartner****beeinträchtigen**. Internationale Organisationen wie die Financial Action Task Force (FATF) bewerten die Effektivität der Geldwäschebannung in verschiedenen Ländern. Negative Bewertungen können dazu führen, dass Deutschland **unter erhöhter Beobachtung** steht und möglicherweise **internationalen Druck** zur Verschärfung seiner Gesetze und Maßnahmen erfährt. Die Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind somit vielschichtig und betreffen verschiedene Bereiche der Gesellschaft. Wirtschaftliche Verzerrungen, sozialer und politischer Vertrauensverlust, rechtliche Strafen und die Beeinträchtigung der internationalen Reputation sind nur einige der gravierenden Auswirkungen. Um diesen negativen Folgen entgegenzuwirken, ist eine verstärkte und koordinierte Anstrengung zur Vorbeugung von Geldwäsche notwendig. ## Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Gesetzliche Reformen** Eine der wichtigsten Maßnahmen zur Entgegenwirkung der Geldwäsche ist die **kontinuierliche Verbesserung** der gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Deutschland hat diese bereits durch das GwG, die [GwG-Richtlinien](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/vierte-eu-geldwaescherichtlinie/) und den **§ 261 des StGBs verschärft**, aber es gibt weiterhin Raum für Verbesserungen. Regelmäßige **Überprüfungen und Anpassungen der Gesetze** sind notwendig, um auf neue Geldwäschemethoden zu reagieren. Zudem sollten härtere Strafen für Verstöße und eine bessere Ausstattung der Strafverfolgungsbehörden implementiert werden. #### **Ergänzung: EU-Gesetzespaket** Nach intensiven Verhandlungen und Abstimmungen wurde das [**AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**](https://www.hilfssheriff.de/eu-gesetzespaket-die-umsetzungsfrist-laeuft/) nun offiziell im Amtsblatt veröffentlicht. Dieses umfassende Regelwerk besteht aus drei wesentlichen und detaillierten Rechtsakten: **Die AMLA-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1620)** Die[**AMLA-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401620) etabliert die **neue EU-Behörde für die Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AMLA)**. Diese Behörde wird in Frankfurt am Main ansässig sein und **ab Mitte 2024** ihre Tätigkeit aufnehmen. Ihre Hauptaufgaben umfassen die direkte und indirekte Aufsicht über Verpflichtete im Finanzsektor, die einem hohen Risiko der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung ausgesetzt sind. **Die Geldwäsche-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1624)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401624) zielt darauf ab, die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für **Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung** zu verhindern. Sie tritt am **10. Juli 2027** in Kraft, mit spezifischen Ausnahmen für **Fußballagenten und Profifußballvereine**, die bis zum **10. Juli 2029** Zeit haben, die notwendigen Anpassungen vorzunehmen. **Einführung einer EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** Ein weiter wichtiger Bestandteil der **Geldwäsche-Verordnung** ist die **Einführung** einer **EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** in Höhe von **10.000 Euro**. Diese Regelung gilt für Barzahlungen zwischen Unternehmen sowie zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern, **nicht jedoch für Transaktionen zwischen Privatpersonen**. EU-Mitgliedstaaten haben die Option, eine niedrigere Obergrenze festzulegen. Die Regelung tritt voraussichtlich **Mitte 2026** in Kraft und stellt besonders für Länder wie Deutschland, die bisher keine Bargeldobergrenze hatten, eine bedeutende Änderung dar. In Deutschland existiert bisher keine generelle Obergrenze für Bargeldzahlungen. Allerdings muss sich der Käufer bei Bargeldzahlungen über 10.000 Euro ausweisen und die Herkunft des Geldes nachweisen. Der Händler ist verpflichtet, diese Informationen zu dokumentieren und aufzubewahren. **Die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie (Richtlinie (EU) 2024/1640)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Richtlinie**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401640) legt die **Mechanismen** fest, die von den Mitgliedstaaten zur Verhinderung der Nutzung des Finanzsystems für Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umgesetzt werden müssen. Sie **gilt nicht unmittelbar in den Mitgliedstaaten**, sondern muss in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden. Die Frist für die meisten Vorgaben ist der **10. Juli 2027**. Diese neuen Regelungen, einschließlich der Bargeldobergrenze, stellen einen bedeutenden Schritt in den Bemühungen der EU dar, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung effektiv zu bekämpfen und die Integrität des Finanzsystems zu gewährleisten. ### **Stärkung der Finanzaufsicht** Die **BaFin, FIU** bzw. allgemein die **deutschen Aufsichtsbehörden** spielen eine **zentrale Rolle** bei der **Beseitigung der Geldwäsche**. Um ihre Effektivität zu steigern, müssen die **personellen und technischen Ressourcen** sowie das **Fachwissen** erweitert werden. Dies umfasst z.B. die Einstellung zusätzlicher Experten und die Einführung moderner Analysetools zum Monitoring verdächtiger Transaktionen. Eine bessere internationale Zusammenarbeit und der Austausch von Informationen mit anderen Behörden können ebenfalls die Effizienz bei der Geldwäscheeindämmung erhöhen. ### **Technologische Lösungen** Zwar bringt der Einsatz von **Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI)** natürlich einerseits neue große Herausforderungen (z.B. gefälschte Ausweisdokumente, Deepfakes) mit sich, andererseits kann der **Einsatz moderner Technologie** die Geldwäscheeindämmung hingegen fördern. KI und maschinelles Lernen bieten **neue Möglichkeiten** zur **Erkennung und Analyse von Mustern**, die auf illegale Finanzströme hinweisen. Diese Technologien können große Datenmengen in Echtzeit überwachen und verdächtige Aktivitäten schneller und präziser identifizieren als herkömmliche Methoden. Darüber hinaus können **Blockchain-Technologien** zur Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen und zur Erhöhung der Transparenz im Finanzsektor beitragen. ### **Internationale Kooperation** Geldwäsche ist ein globales Problem, das eine internationale Zusammenarbeit erfordert. **Gemeinsame Initiativen** und der **Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices** sind entscheidend, um grenzüberschreitende Geldwäsche zielführend zu bekämpfen. Die Teilnahme an internationalen Taskforces und die Unterstützung globaler Standards zur [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaeschebeauftragter-aufgaben-rechte-pflichten-risiken/) sind von größter Wichtigkeit. Das bereits beschlossene **EU GwG-Paket**sowie die Schaffung einer **EU einheitlichen****zentralen Anti-Geldwäsche Behörde**stellt hier einen wichtigen Schritt bei der Entgegenwirkung illegaler Finanzabwicklungen dar. ### **Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Sensibilisierung** Ein oft vernachlässigter Aspekt der Geldwäscheabwehr ist die **Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit** und die Förderung eines besseren Verständnisses für die Risiken und Folgen von Geldwäsche. Durch gezielte **Aufklärungskampagnen** sowie [**(Mitarbeiter-)Schulungen**](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaesche-schulung-mitarbeiter/) können Bürger und Unternehmen über die Anzeichen und Meldemöglichkeiten von Geldwäsche informiert werden. Dies erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass verdächtige Aktivitäten erkannt und gemeldet werden. Diese Maßnahmen sind **zentrale Bausteine** einer erfolgreichen Strategie.

[Jetzt Team anmelden](https://exkulpa.de/akademie/gwg-schulung-fuer-mitarbeiter/) ## Fallbeispiele Im Folgenden noch einige**Skandalbeispielfälle** von Geldwäsche, in die unter anderem **europäische Länder** verwickelt waren: ### **Fallbeispiel: Deutsche Bank** Die **Deutsche Bank** ist mehrfach wegen ihrer Verwicklung in Geldwäscheskandale in die Schlagzeilen geraten. Ein prominenter Fall ist die **Beteiligung** an einem riesigen Geldwäsche-Schema, das als **\"Russischer Spiegelhandel\"** bekannt ist. Zwischen 2011 und 2015 wurden über die Moskauer, Londoner und New Yorker Niederlassungen der Deutschen Bank etwa **10 Milliarden Dollar** gewaschen. Die Bank musste wegen unzureichender Kontrollmechanismen **Strafen** in Höhe von **630 Millionen Dollar** an die US- und britischen Behörden zahlen. ### **Fallbeispiel: Danske Bank** Die **Danske Bank** war in einen der **größten Geldwäscheskandale Europas** verwickelt. Über die estnische Niederlassung der Bank wurden zwischen 2007 und 2015 rund **200 Milliarden Euro** verdächtiger Gelder, hauptsächlich aus Russland, Aserbaidschan und der Ukraine, gewaschen. Der Skandal führte zu einem massiven Verlust an Vertrauen und einer erheblichen Belastung des Rufs der Bank. Die dänischen und estnischen Behörden sowie internationale Regulierungsbehörden führten umfassende Untersuchungen durch, was zu **hohen Geldstrafen und einem Rücktritt des CEO** führte. ### **Fallbeispiel: 1MDB-Skandal** Der **1MDB-Skandal** ist ein **globales Beispiel** für weitreichende Geldwäsche und Korruption. Der malaysische Staatsfonds 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) war in einen massiven Geldwäscheskandal verwickelt, bei dem **Milliarden von Dollar** durch ein komplexes Netzwerk von **Offshore-Konten und Scheinfirmen** gewaschen wurden. Banken in der Schweiz, Singapur und den USA waren beteiligt. In Deutschland spielte die Deutsche Bank erneut eine Rolle, indem sie Transaktionen im Zusammenhang mit 1MDB abgewickelt hat. Der Skandal führte zu **weltweiten Ermittlungen und zahlreichen Verhaftungen**. ### **Fallbeispiel: Wirecard** Der **Wirecard-Skandal** ist ein jüngeres Beispiel für umfassende Finanzkriminalität und Geldwäsche in Deutschland. Das Unternehmen Wirecard, ein Zahlungsdienstleister, war in betrügerische Aktivitäten verwickelt, bei denen angebliche Vermögenswerte in Höhe von **1,9 Milliarden Euro** fehlten. Die Geldwäscheaspekte des Skandals betreffen die komplexen internationalen Transaktionen und das Verschwinden großer Geldsummen durch **Briefkastenfirmen** in verschiedenen Ländern. Der Skandal führte zu einer **umfangreichen Untersuchung** durch deutsche und internationale Behörden und dem **Zusammenbruch des Unternehmens**. ### **Fallbeispiel: HSBC** Die **britische Bank HSBC** war in mehrere Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, darunter die Bereitstellung von Finanzdienstleistungen für Drogenkartelle in Mexiko und Kolumbien. Zwischen 2006 und 2010 wusch HSBC schätzungsweise **881 Millionen Dollar** an Drogengeldern. Die Bank gestand Versäumnisse bei der Geldwäscheprävention ein und zahlte **1,9 Milliarden Dollar an Strafen** im Rahmen eines Vergleichs mit den US-Behörden. Dieser Fall zeigte die globalen Dimensionen von Geldwäsche und die Notwendigkeit strengerer Kontrollen bei internationalen Banken. Diese Fallstudien verdeutlichen die **vielfältigen Methoden** und **enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche in Europa und weltweit**. Sie zeigen, wie leicht Finanzinstitute in illegale Aktivitäten verstrickt werden können und welche gravierenden Folgen dies für die beteiligten Unternehmen und die globale Wirtschaft hat. Durch die Untersuchung dieser Fälle können wichtige Lehren für die Verbesserung der Geldwäscheprävention und -bekämpfung gezogen werden. ## Fazit **Geldwäsche** bleibt ein **erhebliches Problem** in Deutschland und weltweit. Trotz bestehender Gesetze und Regulierungen gibt es zahlreiche Schwächen und Hürden bei der Gegenwehr. Die **Ursachen** für Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind vielfältig, darunter **gesetzliche Lücken**, **unzureichende Aufsicht**, die **Rolle von Banken und Finanzdienstleistern**, die **kritischen Sektoren** und die Nutzung **komplexer Firmenstrukturen** sowie **Steueroasen**. Ein **europäischer Vergleich** zeigt, dass Länder wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich** und **das** **Vereinigte Königreich** besonders **fruchtbare Maßnahmen** zur Eindämmung der Geldwäsche eingeführt haben. Im Gegensatz dazu stehen **Deutschland, die Schweiz** und **Italien**vor **umfangreicheren Komplikationen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter optimieren. Die **Konsequenzen** der Geldwäsche sind weitreichend, einschließlich **wirtschaftlicher Verzerrungen**, **sozialem** und **politischem Vertrauensverlust**, **rechtlichen Strafen** und **Beeinträchtigungen** der internationalen **Reputation**. Fallbeispiele wie die Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, 1MDB, Wirecard und HSBC illustrieren die vielfältigen Methoden und enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche. Die **Abwehr** der Geldwäsche erfordert **kontinuierliche Anpassungen und Verbesserungen**. Neue Technologien und komplexere Finanzströme stellen laufend neue Schwierigkeiten dar. Deutschland muss weiterhin seine gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen verbessern, um mit den sich wandelnden Methoden der Geldwäsche Schritt zu halten. Ein wichtiger Schritt in diese Richtung ist das kürzlich verabschiedete **AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**, das unter anderem eine **EU-weite Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro** einführt. Diese Maßnahme zielt darauf ab, die Transparenz bei größeren Finanztransaktionen zu erhöhen und die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für illegale Aktivitäten zu erschweren. Ein verstärkter Fokus auf die internationale Zusammenarbeit ist unerlässlich. Nur durch gemeinsame Anstrengungen und den Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices kann Geldwäsche konsequent entgegengewirkt werden. Die Integration **moderner Technologien** wie Künstlicher Intelligenz und **Blockchain** kann ebenfalls dazu beitragen, die Erkennung und Verfolgung von illegalen Finanzströmen zu verbessern.

It is estimated that 2- 5% of the global GDP or US$800 billion-US$2 trillion is being laundered every year across the globe. The lower range itself is a significant amount for the world to consider. For comparison, Saudi Arabia’s estimated nominal GDP is US$748 billion in 2018, ranking the country at 19 in the world. In order to combat money laundering, governments have formulated and implemented policies, and they have been successful in identifying more and more laundering activities and subsequently taking remedial measures. Here is an attempt to portray some of the biggest money laundering cases by the estimated size of money being laundered in recent times. The figures have been converted into US dollars in some cases for easier comparison. ## Commerzbank (US$347 million) The London branch of Commerzbank is the subject of one of the most severe fines in the UK. Commerzbank was facing a $50 million fine in June 2020. This German banking firm ignored several warnings from the cautious regulator and failed to adopt necessary know-your-customer laws affecting thousands of the bank’s customers. In 2016 and 2017, the bank failed to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-kickback laws. Due to a shortage of staff in the anti-money laundering department, Commerzbank employed 47 additional employees, bringing the total number of AML professionals in the department to 50. This helped the bank avoid future fines. Despite this, the bank failed to accommodate and offer necessary anti-money laundering (AML) protections. ## Westpac Bank (US$11 billion) With 19 million global transactions, this Australian financial service resolved with AUSTRAC in 2020 for AML concerns. They ended up paying one of the largest fines in history as a result of their efforts to avoid the regulations. Westpac skirted around several provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act of 2006. The banks’ ignorance of the law resulted in the penalties, which are believed to be worth over $11 billion. The banks’ ignorance was linked to offshore paedophile rings in Southeast Asia, prompting harsh reprimands. Because many of the transactions were linked to the network, the authorities investigated the settlement, which resulted in a $1.3 billion fine. ## Goldman Sachs (US$600 million) The world-famous Goldman Sachs was hit with the greatest fine in 2020. In the business’s 151-year history, the biggest fine ever issued in the US represented the first time the company had ever pleaded guilty to any financial violation. The Malaysian unit of Goldman Sachs was involved in the [1MBD scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/1mdb-scandal-explained-a-tale-of-malaysias-missing-billions), which had been in the works for more than ten years. [Bribery](/glossary/bribery), money laundering, and gross misuse of consumer funds were all committed by the company. After agreeing to pay a $2.5 billion fine, an additional $1.4 billion was fined in order to avoid prosecution by paying out 1MBD assets. ## Wachovia (US$390 billion) Now part of Wells Fargo, Wachovia was one of the biggest banks in the US. In 2010, the bank was found to have allowed drug cartels in Mexico to launder close to US$390 billion through its branches during 2004-2007. The drug cartels used to smuggle US dollars received from drug sales in the US across the Mexican border. Then, they used money exchangers to deposit the money into their bank accounts in Mexico, where regulatory requirements with regard to the source of funds were not on par with current standards. Later, the money was wired back to Wachovia’s accounts in the US, and the bank failed to check the origin of these funds. In addition, the drug cartels used Wachovia’s bulk cash service to ship back banknotes to the US. ## Standard Chartered (US$265 billion) The British banking giant in 2012 was accused by New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) of its failures in anti-money laundering controls that helped the Iranian government to circumvent US regulations to clean money to the tune of US$265 billion over a period of 10 years. In addition, the bank was accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Libya and Sudan. ## Danske Bank (US$228 billion) Denmark’s largest bank came into the limelight after the European Commission described its US$228 billion money laundering case as the biggest scandal in Europe. The bank’s Estonian branch allegedly had thousands of suspicious customers who made use of the bank’s weak controls to carry out illicit transactions worth about US$228 billion during 2007-2015. ## Nauru (US$70 billion) Nauru, once known for its tax-haven status with a large number of shell banks, helped Russian criminals launder an estimated US$70 billion in 1998. At that time, the island country in Micronesia, northeast of Australia, was allegedly allowing its banks to operate without properly identifying its customers and checking the source of deposits. ## BCCI (US$23 billion) From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and its customers were found to have committed fraud and money laundering activities totaling US$23 billion. BCCI was formed up purposefully to circumvent centralised regulatory supervision, according to investigators in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. To avoid regulatory inspection, the bank allegedly used a variety of complicated strategies, including shell firms, secrecy havens, kickbacks, and bribery. ## HSBC ($8 billion) In 2012, the bank was fined for having insufficient control measures, which permitted the laundering of an estimated $8 billion over a seven-year period. Provision of banking services and US dollars to some Saudi Arabian banks with apparent ties to terrorists, circumventing international sanctions and allowing transactions involving blacklisted countries such as Iran and North Korea. It also included improper controls at HSBC Mexico despite its apparent drug trafficking and money laundering problem was among the complaints levelled against the bank. For failing to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or know-your-customer regulations, all of the above-mentioned enterprises and financial institutions faced harsh penalties. Some of these financial institutions unwittingly participated in serious criminal behaviour and crimes by failing to pay attention to the protocols or deciding not to follow them. Other institutions can prevent these blunders by comprehending and implementing the established standards, ensuring that money laundering is not unintentionally carried out. Thus, they can avoid being part in money laundering cases. Advances in technology, particularly in financial services, have made it possible for criminals to move money around the world with ease. Launderers have been spotted devising complex ways to go beyond a government’s remedies. Banks have started realising the fact that their legacy rule-based systems cannot effectively mitigate risks related to money laundering. Now, they need to embrace advanced technology that can effectively solve their problems of getting involved in money laundering cases. Financial institutions can effectively make use of solutions based on machine learning, such as [Tookitaki’s AML Suite](/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), to counter money laundering cases.

A senior citizen in Navi Mumbai answered a number that appeared to belong to the police. Within hours, she was trapped on a video call with men in uniforms, accused of laundering money for terrorists. Terrified, she wired ₹21 lakh into what she believed was a government-controlled account. She was not alone. In August 2025, cases of “digital arrest” scams surged across India. An elderly couple in Madhya Pradesh drained nearly ₹50 lakh of their life savings after spending 13 days under constant video surveillance by fraudsters posing as investigators. In Rajkot, criminals used the pretext of a real anti-terror operation to extort money from a student. These scams are not crude phishing attempts. They are meticulously staged psychological operations, exploiting people’s deepest fears of authority and social disgrace. Victims are not tricked into handing over passwords. They are coerced, minute by minute, into making transfers themselves. The results are devastating, both for individuals and the wider financial system. ## Background of the Scam The anatomy of a digital arrest scam follows a chillingly consistent script. **1. The Call of Fear** Fraudsters begin with a phone call, often masked to resemble an official number. The caller claims the victim’s details have surfaced in a serious crime: drug trafficking, terror financing, or money laundering. The consequences are presented as immediate arrest, frozen accounts, or ruined reputations. **2. Escalation to Video** To heighten credibility, the fraudster insists on switching to a video call. Victims are connected to people wearing uniforms, holding forged identity cards, or even sitting before backdrops resembling police stations and courtrooms. **3. Isolation and Control** Once on video, the victim is told they cannot disconnect. In some cases, they are monitored round the clock, ordered not to use their phone for any purpose other than the call. Contact with family or friends is prohibited, under the guise of “confidential investigations.” **4. The Transfer of Funds** The victim is then directed to transfer money into so-called “secure accounts” to prove their innocence or pay bail. These accounts are controlled by criminals and serve as the first layer in complex laundering networks. Victims, believing they are cooperating with the law, empty fixed deposits, break retirement savings, and transfer sums that can take a lifetime to earn. The method blends social engineering with coercive control. It is not the theft of data, but the hijacking of human behaviour. ## What the Case Revealed The 2025 wave of digital arrest scams in India exposed three critical truths about modern fraud. **1. Video Calls Are No Longer a Guarantee of Authenticity** For years, people considered video more secure than phone calls or emails. If you could see someone’s face, the assumption was that they were genuine. These scams demolished that trust. Fraudsters showed that live video, like written messages, can be staged, manipulated, and weaponised. **2. Authority Bias is a Fraudster’s Greatest Weapon** Humans are hardwired to respect authority, especially law enforcement. By impersonating police or investigators, criminals bypass the victim’s critical reasoning. Fear of prison or social disgrace outweighs logical checks. **3. Coercion Multiplies the Damage** Unlike [phishing](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/phishing) or one-time deceptions, digital arrests involve prolonged psychological manipulation. Victims are kept online for days, bombarded with threats and false evidence. Under this pressure, even cautious individuals break down. The results are not minor losses, but catastrophic financial wipe-outs. **4. Organised Networks Are Behind the Scenes** The professionalism and scale suggest syndicates, not lone operators. From forged documents to layered mule accounts, the fraud points to criminal hubs capable of running scripted operations across borders. ## Impact on Financial Institutions and Corporates Though victims are individuals, the implications extend far into the financial and corporate world. **1. Reputational Risk** When victims lose life savings through accounts within the banking system, they often blame their bank as much as the fraudster. Even if technically blameless, institutions suffer a hit to public trust. **2. Pressure on Fraud Systems** Digital arrest scams exploit authorised transactions. Victims themselves make the transfers. Traditional detection tools that focus on unauthorised access or password breaches cannot easily flag these cases. **3. Global Movement of Funds** Money from scams rarely stays local. Transfers are routed across borders within hours, layered through mule accounts, e-wallets, and fintech platforms. This complicates recovery and exposes gaps in international coordination. **4. Corporate Vulnerability** The threat is not limited to retirees or individuals. In Singapore earlier this year, a finance director was tricked into wiring half a million dollars during a deepfake board call. Digital arrest tactics could just as easily target corporate employees handling high-value transactions. **5. Regulatory Expectations** As scams multiply, regulators are pressing institutions to demonstrate stronger customer protections, more resilient monitoring, and greater collaboration. Failure to act risks not only reputational damage but also regulatory penalties. ## Lessons Learned from the Scam **For Individuals** * Treat unsolicited calls from law enforcement with suspicion. Real investigations do not begin on the phone. * Verify independently by calling the published numbers of agencies. * Watch for signs of manipulation, such as demands for secrecy or threats of immediate arrest. * Educate vulnerable groups, particularly senior citizens, about how these scams operate. **For Corporates** * Train employees, especially those in finance roles, to recognise coercion tactics. * Require secondary verification for urgent, high-value transfers, especially when directed to new accounts. * Encourage a speak-up culture where staff can challenge suspicious instructions without fear of reprimand. **For Financial Institutions** * Monitor for mule account activity. Unexplained inflows followed by rapid withdrawals are a red flag. * Run customer awareness campaigns, explaining how digital arrest scams work. * Share intelligence with peers and regulators to prevent repeat incidents across institutions. ## The Role of Technology in Prevention Digital arrest scams prove that traditional safeguards are insufficient. Fraudsters are not stealing credentials but manipulating behaviour. Prevention requires smarter, adaptive systems. **1. Behavioural Monitoring** Transactions made under duress often differ from normal patterns. Advanced analytics can detect anomalies, such as sudden large transfers from accounts with low historical activity. **2. Typology-Driven Detection** Platforms like Tookitaki’s [FinCense](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) leverage the [AFC Ecosystem](https://www.afcecosystem.org) to encode real-world scam scenarios into detection logic. As digital arrest typologies are identified, they can be integrated quickly to improve monitoring. **3. AI-Powered Simulations** Institutions can run simulations of coercion-based scams to test whether their processes would withstand them. These exercises reveal gaps in escalation and verification controls. **4. Federated Learning for Collective Defence** With federated learning, insights from one bank can be shared across many without exposing sensitive data. If one institution sees a pattern in digital arrest cases, others can benefit almost instantly. **5. Smarter Alert Management** Agentic AI can review and narrate the context of alerts, allowing investigators to understand whether unusual activity stems from duress. This speeds up response times and prevents irreversible losses. ## Conclusion The digital arrest scam is not just a fraud. It is a form of psychological captivity, where victims are imprisoned through fear on their own devices. In 2025, India saw a surge of such cases, stripping people of their savings and shaking trust in digital communications. The message is clear: scams no longer rely on technical breaches. They rely on exploiting human trust. For individuals, the defence is awareness and verification. For corporates, it is embedding strong protocols and encouraging a culture of questioning. For financial institutions, the challenge is profound. They must detect authorised transfers made under coercion, collaborate across borders, and deploy AI-powered defences that learn as fast as the criminals do. If 2024 was the year of deepfake deception, 2025 is becoming the year of coercion-based fraud. The industry’s response will determine whether scams like digital arrests remain isolated tragedies or become a systemic crisis. Protecting trust is no longer optional. It is the frontline of financial crime prevention. Blogs 25 Aug 2025 5 min read ## Stablecoins Are Booming. Is Compliance Falling Behind? Programmable money isn’t a futuristic buzzword anymore — it’s here, and it’s scaling at breakneck speed. In 2024, stablecoin transactions exceeded $27 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. From international remittances to e-commerce, stablecoins are reshaping how money moves across borders. But there’s a catch: the same features that make stablecoins so powerful — speed, cost efficiency, accessibility — also make them attractive for financial crime. Instant, irreversible, and identity-light transactions have created a compliance challenge unlike any before. For regulators, banks, and fintechs, the question is clear: can compliance scale as fast as stablecoins? ## The Rise of Stablecoins: More Than Just Crypto Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar or euro. Unlike Bitcoin or Ether, they aren’t designed for volatility — they’re designed for utility. That’s why they’ve become the backbone of digital payments and decentralised finance (DeFi). * **Cross-border remittances**: Workers abroad can send money home cheaply and instantly. * **Trading and settlements**: Exchanges use stablecoins as liquidity anchors. * **Merchant adoption**: From small retailers to payment giants like PayPal (with its **PYUSD stablecoin** launched in 2023), stablecoin rails are entering mainstream commerce. With global players like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) dominating, and even central banks exploring CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), it’s clear stablecoins are no longer niche. They are programmable, scalable, and systemically important. But scale brings scrutiny. ## The Compliance Gap: Why Old Tools Don’t Work Most financial institutions still rely on compliance infrastructure designed decades ago for slower, linear payment systems. Batch settlements, SWIFT messages, and pre-clearing windows gave compliance teams time to check, flag, or stop suspicious activity. Stablecoins operate on entirely different principles: * **Real-time settlement**: Transactions confirm in seconds. * **Pseudonymous wallets**: No guaranteed link between a wallet and its true owner. * **DeFi composability**: Funds can move through multiple protocols, contracts, and blockchains with no central chokepoint. * **Irreversibility**: Once sent, funds can’t be clawed back. This creates an environment where bad actors can launder funds at the speed of code. Legacy compliance systems — built for yesterday’s risks — simply cannot keep up. ## The New Typologies Emerging on Stablecoin Rails Financial crime doesn’t stand still. It adapts to new rails faster than regulation or compliance can. Here are some typologies unique to stablecoins: 1. **Money Mule Networks** Organised groups recruit international students or gig workers to act as “cash-out points,” moving illicit funds through stablecoin wallets before converting back to fiat. 2. **Cross-Chain Laundering** Criminals exploit bridges between blockchains (e.g., Ethereum to Tron or Solana) to break traceability, making it harder to follow the money. This tactic was highlighted in multiple reports after North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered hundreds of millions in stolen crypto across chains. 3. **DeFi Layering** Funds are routed through decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, or automated market makers to mix flows and obscure origins. The U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash in 2022 marked a watershed moment, underscoring how DeFi mixers can become systemic laundering tools. 4. **Sanctions Evasion** With traditional banking rails restricted, sanctioned entities increasingly turn to stablecoins. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has flagged stablecoin usage in multiple enforcement actions tied to Russia and other high-risk jurisdictions. Each of these typologies highlights the speed, complexity, and opacity of stablecoin-based laundering. They don’t look like traditional fiat red flags — they demand new methods of detection. ## What Compliance Needs to Look Like for Stablecoins To match the speed of programmable money, compliance must itself become programmable, adaptive, and dynamic. Static, rule-based systems are insufficient. Instead, compliance must shift to a risk infrastructure that is: ### 1. Risk-in-Motion Monitoring Rather than flagging transactions after they settle, monitoring must happen in real time, detecting structuring, layering, and unusual flow patterns as they unfold. ### 2. Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening Name checks aren’t enough. Risk detection must consider wallet metadata, behavioural history, device intelligence, and network analysis to surface high-risk entities hidden behind pseudonyms. ### 3. Wallet Risk Scoring A static “high-risk wallet list” doesn’t work in a world where wallets are created and discarded easily. Risk scoring must be dynamic and contextual, combining geolocation, device, transaction history, and counterparties into evolving risk profiles. This is compliance at the speed of programmable money. ## Tookitaki’s FinCense: Building the Trust Layer for Stablecoins At Tookitaki, we’re not retrofitting legacy tools to fit this new world. We’re building the infrastructure-grade compliance layer programmable money deserves. Here’s how [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) powers trust on stablecoin rails: * **Risk-in-Motion Monitoring** Detects structuring, layering, and anomalous flows across chains in real time. * **Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening** Goes beyond simple lists, screening metadata, networks, and behavioural red flags. * **Wallet Risk Scoring** Integrates device, location, and transaction intelligence to give every wallet a living, breathing risk profile. * **Federated Intelligence from the** [**AFC Ecosystem**](https://www.afcecosystem.org) Scenarios contributed by 200+ compliance experts worldwide enrich the system with the latest typologies. * **Agentic AI for Investigations** Accelerates investigations with an AI copilot, surfacing insights and reducing [false positives](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/false-positives). FinCense is modular, composable, and built for the future of programmable finance. Whether you’re a digital asset exchange, fintech, or bank integrating stablecoin rails, it enables you to operate with trust and resilience. ## Conclusion: Scaling Trust with Stablecoins Stablecoins are here to stay. They’re reshaping payments, cross-border transfers, and financial inclusion. But they’re also rewriting the rules of financial crime. The next phase of growth won’t be defined by speed or accessibility alone — it will be defined by trust. And trust comes from compliance that can move as fast and adapt as dynamically as programmable money itself. Stablecoins will define the next decade of finance. Whether they become rails for inclusion or loopholes for crime depends on how we build trust today. Tookitaki’s FinCense is here to make that trust possible.

Beyond the headlines about Ferraris and luxury goods lies a sobering truth: criminals are still exploiting the blind spots in Australia’s financial crime defences.* ## A Case That Reads Like a Movie Script On 30 July 2025, Australian police raided properties across Sydney and arrested two men—Bing “Michael” Li, 38, and Yizhe “Tony” He, 34. Both men were charged with an astonishing 194 fraud-related offences. Li faces 87 charges tied to AUD 12.9 million, while He faces 107 charges tied to about AUD 4 million. Authorities also froze AUD 38 million worth of assets, including Bentleys, Ferraris, designer goods, and property leases. At the heart of the case was a fraud and laundering scheme that funnelled stolen money into the high-end economy of cars, luxury fashion, and short-term property leases. Investigators dubbed them “ghost cars”—vehicles purchased as a way to obscure illicit funds. It’s a tale that grabs attention for its glitz, but what really matters is the deeper lesson: Australia still has critical AML blind spots that criminals know how to exploit. ## How the Syndicate Operated The mechanics of the scheme reveal just how calculated it was: * **Rapid loan cycling:** The accused are alleged to have obtained loans, often short-term, which were cycled quickly to create complex repayment patterns. This made tracing the origins of funds difficult. * **Luxury asset laundering:** The money was used to purchase high-value cars (Ferraris, Bentleys, Mercedes) and designer items from brands like Louis Vuitton. Assets of prestige become a laundering tool, integrating dirty money into seemingly legitimate wealth. * **Property as camouflage:** Short-term leases of expensive properties in Barangaroo and other high-end districts provided both a lifestyle cover and another channel to absorb illicit funds. * **Gatekeeper loopholes:** Real estate agents, accountants, and luxury dealers in Australia are not yet fully bound by AML/CTF obligations. This gap created the perfect playground for laundering. What’s striking is not the creativity of the scheme—it’s the simplicity. By targeting sectors without AML scrutiny, the syndicate turned everyday transactions into a pipeline for cleaning millions. ## The Regulatory Gap This case lands at a critical time. For years, Australia has been under pressure from the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf) to extend AML/CTF laws to the so-called “gatekeeper professions”—real estate agents, accountants, lawyers, and dealers in high-value goods. As of 2025, these obligations are still not fully in place. The expansion is only scheduled to take effect from July 2026. Until then, large swathes of the economy remain outside [AUSTRAC](https://www.tookitaki.com/blog/austrac-aml-ctf-regulations-guide)’s oversight. The Barangaroo arrests underscore what critics have long warned: criminals don’t wait for legislation. They are already steps ahead, embedding illicit funds into sectors that regulators have yet to fence off. For businesses in real estate, luxury retail, and professional services, this case is more than a headline—it’s a wake-up call to prepare now, not later. ## Why This Case Matters for Australia The Barangaroo case isn’t just about two individuals—it highlights systemic vulnerabilities in the Australian financial ecosystem. 1. **Criminal Adaptation:** Syndicates will always pivot to the weakest link. If banks tighten their checks, criminals move to less regulated industries. 2. **Erosion of Trust:** When high-value markets become conduits for laundering, it damages Australia’s reputation as a clean, well-regulated financial hub. 3. **Compliance Risk:** Businesses in these sectors risk being blindsided by new regulations if they don’t start implementing AML controls now. 4. **Global Implications:** With assets like luxury cars and crypto being easy to move or sell internationally, local failures in AML quickly ripple across borders. This isn’t an isolated story. It’s part of a broader trend where fraud, luxury assets, and regulatory lag intersect to create fertile ground for financial crime. ## Lessons for Businesses For financial institutions, fintechs, and gatekeeper industries, the Barangaroo case offers several practical takeaways: * **Monitor for rapid loan cycling:** Short-term loans repaid unusually fast, or loans tied to sudden high-value purchases, should trigger alerts. * **Scrutinise asset purchases:** Repeated luxury acquisitions, especially where the source of funds is vague, are classic laundering red flags. * **Don’t rely solely on regulation:** Just because AML obligations aren’t mandatory yet doesn’t mean businesses can ignore risk. Voluntary adoption of AML best practices can prevent reputational damage. * **Collaborate cross-sector:** Banks, real estate firms, and luxury dealers must share intelligence. Laundering rarely stays within one sector. * **Prepare for 2026:** When the law expands, regulators will expect not just compliance but also readiness. Being proactive now can avoid penalties later. ## How Tookitaki’s FinCense Can Help The Barangaroo case demonstrates a truth that regulators and compliance teams already know: criminals are fast, and rules often move too slowly. This is where [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), Tookitaki’s AI-powered compliance platform, makes the difference. * **Scenario-based Monitoring** FinCense doesn’t just look for generic suspicious behaviour—it monitors for specific typologies like “rapid loan cycling leading to high-value asset purchases.” These scenarios mirror real-world cases, allowing institutions to spot laundering patterns early. * **Federated Intelligence** FinCense leverages insights from a global compliance community. A laundering method detected in one country can be quickly shared and simulated in others. If the Barangaroo pattern emerged elsewhere, FinCense could help Australian institutions adapt almost immediately. * **Agentic AI for Real-Time Detection** Criminal tactics evolve constantly. FinCense’s Agentic AI ensures models don’t go stale—it adapts to new data, learns continuously, and responds to threats as they arise. That means institutions don’t wait months for rule updates; they act in real time. * **End-to-End Compliance Coverage** From customer onboarding to transaction monitoring and investigation, FinCense provides a unified platform. For banks, this means capturing anomalies at multiple points, not just after funds have already flowed into cars and luxury handbags. The result is a system that doesn’t just tick compliance boxes but actively prevents fraud and laundering—protecting both businesses and Australia’s reputation. ## The Bigger Picture: Trust and Reputation Australia has ambitions to strengthen its role as a regional financial hub. But trust is the currency that underpins global finance. Cases like Barangaroo remind us that even one high-profile lapse can shake investor and customer confidence. With scams and laundering scandals making headlines globally—from Crown Resorts to major online frauds—Australia cannot afford to be reactive. For businesses, the message is clear: compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines, it’s about protecting your licence to operate. Customers and partners expect vigilance, transparency, and accountability. ## Conclusion: A Warning Shot The Barangaroo “ghost cars and luxury laundering” saga is more than a crime story—it’s a preview of what happens when regulation lags and businesses underestimate financial crime risk. With AUSTRAC set to extend AML coverage in 2026, industries like real estate and luxury retail must act now. Waiting until the law forces compliance could mean walking straight into reputational disaster. For financial institutions and businesses alike, the smarter path is to embrace advanced solutions like Tookitaki’s FinCense, which combine scenario-driven intelligence with adaptive AI. Because at the end of the day, Ferraris and Bentleys may be glamorous—but when they’re bought with dirty money, they carry a far higher cost.

Мы попытаемся разобраться с их пагубными последствиями для бизнеса и экономики в целом, а также понять методики, которые корпорации могут использовать, чтобы защитить себя от такой незаконной деятельности. Процесс отмывания денег (ОД) наносит значительный ущерб бизнесу, инвестиционному климату и экономической ситуации в целом. Это существенно **способствует росту преступности и коррупции и вызывает значительное снижение эффективности реального сектора экономики**. В результате эта преступная деятельность проявляется и многими другими последствиями. Масштабы такого противозаконного поведения в глобальном масштабе ошеломляют. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) сообщает, что каждый год от 2 до 5% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП) подвергается отмыванию денег на сумму от 754 миллиардов до 2 триллионов долларов. В юрисдикциях большинства стран **отмывание денег является тяжким преступлением, наказуемым лишением свободы и/или значительным штрафом.** Например, в Соединенных Штатах Америки наказание за соучастие в отмывании денег может быть довольно суровым: это либо штраф размером до 250 000 долларов или лишение свободы сроком до пяти лет. Многие предприятия могут не обращать внимания на реальность того, что их используют для отмывания денег. Несмотря на то, что не все коммерческие организации могут быть привлечены к ответственности за незаконную деятельность, осуществляемую через них, организации, обязанные соблюдать правила по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML), включая банки, должны соответствовать другому стандарту. **Последствия могут быть колоссальными, если противоправное поведение будет обнаружено в процессе аудита.** Например, Danske Bank недавно был оштрафован на 470 миллионов евро (495 миллионов долларов) из-за своего участия в международном скандале с отмыванием денег. Чтобы обезопасить свой бизнес от преступников и наложения нормативных штрафов, необходимо вникнуть в тонкости отмывания денег, включая распространенные схемы, которые обычно используются, и меры, которые можно предпринять для предотвращения этого. ## Что такое отмывание денег (ОД) и почему об этом важно знать Базовое определение процесса отмывания денег характеризуется умышленным сокрытием или искажением источника доходов, полученных незаконным путем, для создания впечатления, что средства были получены из законных источников. **Отмывание денег (ОД) предполагает действия, при которых злоумышленник скрывает источник средств, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности**, такой как незаконный оборот наркотиков, взяточничество или мошенничество. > *Действия по борьбе с отмыванием денег (ОД) часто связаны с борьбой с финансированием терроризма (ФТ), поскольку и ОД, и ФТ влекут за собой перенаправление средств.* Согласно выводам Группы разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ), ежегодно из стран с более низким уровнем дохода отмывается ошеломляющая сумма в 1,6 триллиона долларов, причём доходы, как правило, поступают от политической коррупции. В таких областях **коррупция усугубляет бедность, что ведёт к разрушению окружающей среды и вызывая экономический застой**. Из-за сложной связи между отмыванием денег и коррупцией любые инициативы, направленные на сдерживание распространения незаконных средств, также играют решающую роль в снижении уровня коррупции в глобальном масштабе. Такие виды деятельности, как незаконная продажа оружия, контрабанда и организованная преступность, включая незаконный оборот наркотиков и проституцию, могут приносить значительные суммы денег. Точно так же схемы хищения, инсайдерской торговли, взяточничества и компьютерного мошенничества могут приносить значительную прибыль и создавать стимулы для «узаконивания» доходов, полученных незаконным путём, посредством отмывания денег. Когда преступная деятельность приводит к значительной прибыли, **вовлечённые стороны должны найти способ сохранить контроль над средствами, не привлекая внимания к основной деятельности или причастным лицам**. Преступники делают это, маскируя источник средств, изменяя их форму или перемещая средства в место, где они с меньшей вероятностью привлекут внимание. В свете растущих опасений по поводу отмывания денег на саммите Большой семерки в Париже в 1989 году была создана Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) для выработки согласованного международного ответа. Одной из основных задач ФАТФ была разработка набора из 40 рекомендаций, в которых изложены меры, которые должны принять национальные правительства для реализации эффективных программ по борьбе с отмыванием денег. ## Сколько денег отмывается в год? По самой своей природе отмывание денег — это незаконная деятельность, совершаемая преступниками, которые действуют за пределами стандартных представлений об экономической и финансовой деятельности. В сочетании с другими аспектами скрытой экономической деятельности были предоставлены приблизительные значения, чтобы дать представление о масштабах рассматриваемой проблемы. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) провело всесторонний анализ, чтобы установить размер незаконных средств, полученных от наркотрафика и организованной преступности, и степень отмывания этих средств. В отчёте УНП ООН приблизительно указано, что **в 2009 году преступные доходы составили 3,6% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП)**, при этом 2,7% (что эквивалентно 1,6 триллионам долларов США) этих доходов было отмыто. Это соответствует широко цитируемой оценке Международного валютного фонда (МВФ), согласно которой в 1998 году общий объём отмывания денег в мире может составлять от двух до пяти процентов мирового ВВП. Используя статистику 1998 года, эти проценты позволяют предположить, что феномен отмывания денег колеблется от 590 миллиардов долларов США до 1,5 триллионов долларов США. На тот момент нижняя цифра была примерно соизмерима с общим объёмом производства в экономике, сопоставимой по размеру с экономикой Испании. Однако при рассмотрении приведённых выше оценок необходимо проявлять осторожность. Они просто предназначены для приблизительного определения масштабов отмывания денег. **Из-за тайного характера транзакций точные статистические данные недоступны**, что делает невозможным точную оценку общемирового количества денег, отмываемых каждый год. Поэтому Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) воздерживается от публикации каких-либо данных по этому поводу. ## Три основных этапа отмывания денег ### Этап размещения Незаконные средства могут быть интегрированы в финансовую систему прямо или косвенно. На этапе размещения наиболее распространенным методом является дробление больших сумм денег на более мелкие, менее заметные суммы, которые могут быть депонированы на один или несколько банковских счетов с использованием метода **«смурфинга»**. Компании по обслуживанию денег часто используются для осуществления смурфинга. **Другие методы размещения включают в себя:** * **Ложное выставление счетов-фактур** включает создание счетов-фактур за несуществующие товары или услуги для завышения или взимания платы за услуги, которые никогда не оказывались. Разница между фактической стоимостью товаров или услуг и завышенной суммой затем переводится как отмытые деньги. * **Смешивание незаконных денег с законными деньгами** — включает в себя внесение наличных, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности, на банковские счета с законно заработанными средствами, что затрудняет отслеживание незаконных средств правоохранительными органами. * **Покупка иностранной валюты** — включает в себя конвертацию больших сумм незаконных денег в другую валюту, которую затем можно положить на счета в иностранных банках или использовать для покупки активов в других странах. * **Покупка ценных бумаг или страховки за наличные** — предполагает покупку акций, облигаций или страховых полисов за наличные, которые впоследствии можно продать за чистые деньги. * **Азартные игры и ставки на спортивные события** — могут использоваться для отмывания денег путём размещения ставок за наличные деньги, полученные в результате незаконной деятельности, а затем получения выигрыша в виде чистых денег. ### Этап наслоения Процесс, известный как «наслоение», обозначает сложный набор действий, направленных на выявление незаконного происхождения денег и дальнейшую **маскировку их источника путём создания нескольких «слоёв» транзакций**, чтобы запутать след проверки. Эта изощренная практика служит цели сокрытия происхождения незаконно полученных активов, усложняя их обнаружение и отслеживание. Проведение фазы наслоения представляет собой наиболее сложную стадию этой мошеннической операции. Это влечёт за собой серию сложных финансовых транзакций, которые часто пересекают национальные границы посредством международных денежных переводов. Для реализации стратегии наслоения средства могут быть направлены через покупку и продажу различных типов инвестиций или через цепочку счетов, открытых в разных финансовых учреждениях в разных юрисдикциях. Такой капитал, полученный незаконным путём, часто перенаправляется в страны с разрешительными правилами по борьбе с отмыванием денег (БОД) или в страны, которые не сотрудничают с расследованиями по ПОД. ### Этап интеграции После того как незаконные деньги были успешно размещены и распределены, следующим этапом для преступников является реинтеграция или «возвращение» денег себе таким образом, чтобы скрыть их незаконное происхождение, сделав их «чистыми». По завершении этого этапа средства становятся частью законной финансовой системы и могут свободно использоваться преступниками. Основная цель этого этапа — **интегрировать деньги в экономику, не вызывая подозрений и не привлекая внимания правоохранительных органов**. Для достижения этой цели преступники могут приобретать такие активы, как недвижимость, произведения искусства, драгоценные украшения или дорогие автомобили, среди прочего. Эти виды активов могут служить для узаконивания ранее полученного незаконным путём капитала, поскольку они могут восприниматься как приобретённые законным путём. ## Как отмывание денег влияет на бизнес и экономику Отмывание денег представляет собой серьезную угрозу для бизнеса, что приводит к множеству неблагоприятных последствий, таких как потеря доходов, ущерб репутации и штрафы регулирующих органов на миллионы долларов или приостановление действия лицензий. Кроме того, социально-экономические последствия ОД имеют далеко идущие и разрушительные последствия с масштабным эффектом, таким как укоренение коррупции, эскалация преступной деятельности, подрыв доверия иностранных инвесторов, увеличение неравенства доходов и замедление экономического роста. Эти последствия вызывают особую озабоченность, поскольку они могут **осложнять и усугублять ранее существовавшие экономические и социальные проблемы**, создавая дальнейшую дестабилизацию и причиняя вред. Функционирование рынка банковских и финансовых услуг в рамках повышенных правовых, профессиональных и этических стандартов является неотъемлемой частью сохранения его целостности. Репутация финансового учреждения как честного является одним из его самых ценных активов. Предположим, что конкретное учреждение может обрабатывать средства, полученные в результате преступной деятельности, либо из-за взяточничества его сотрудников или директоров, либо из-за того, что они закрывают глаза на незаконный характер таких средств. В этом случае это **учреждение рискует стать активным соучастником преступников** и тем самым стать частью самой преступной сети. Любые доказательства такого соучастия обязательно навредят восприятию других финансовых посредников и регулирующих органов, помимо обычных клиентов. Неконтролируемое отмывание денег также чревато негативными макроэкономическими последствиями, такими как необъяснимые изменения в спросе на деньги, пруденциальные риски для надёжности банков, влияние “загрязнения” на законные финансовые операции и повышенная волатильность международных потоков капитала и обменных курсов из-за непредвиденных трансграничных переводов активов. Кроме того, успешное отмывание денег вознаграждает коррупцию и преступность, нанося ущерб целостности общества в целом, подрывая демократию и ставя под угрозу верховенство закона. Отмыватели денег постоянно ищут новые способы отмывания своих доходов, полученных нечестным путём. **Экономики с расширяющимися или появляющимися финансовыми центрами, но с недостаточными мерами защиты, особенно уязвимы**, поскольку страны с хорошо зарекомендовавшими себя финансовыми центрами внедряют обширные протоколы по борьбе с отмыванием денег. Отмыватели будут использовать различия в национальных системах борьбы с отмыванием денег, перемещая свои сети в страны и финансовые системы со слабыми или неэффективными мерами противодействия. Кто-то может возразить, что развивающиеся страны не могут быть слишком разборчивыми, когда речь идёт о привлечении капитала. Однако откладывать борьбу с мошенниками рискованно. Чем больше откладываются такие действия, тем более укоренившейся может стать организованная преступность. Подобно нарушению целостности конкретного финансового учреждения, присутствие организованной преступности, контролирующей и влияющей на коммерческий и финансовый сектор страны, **наносит ущерб прямым иностранным инвестициям**. > *Таким образом, борьба с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма имеет решающее значение для создания благоприятной деловой среды, что является необходимым условием устойчивого экономического развития.* Потенциальные социальные и политические последствия неустранённого или плохо управляемого отмывания денег могут быть серьёзными. Организованная преступность может проникнуть в финансовые учреждения, захватить контроль над значительной частью экономики посредством инвестиций или подкупить государственных чиновников и даже правительства. Экономическое и политическое влияние преступных организаций может подорвать общественное устройство, общие этические нормы и, в конечном счёте, демократические институты общества. В странах, переходящих к демократическим системам, криминальное влияние может подорвать этот переход. По своей сути **отмывание денег неразрывно связано с преступной деятельностью**, которая его породила. Благодаря отмыванию средств преступная деятельность может продолжаться. ## Как выявить и предотвратить отмывание денег Для обеспечения безопасности бизнеса и предотвращения финансовых преступлений необходимо внедрить комплексную программу соблюдения требований по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML). Такая программа должна чётко определять процедуры выявления, оценки и сообщения о подозрительной финансовой деятельности. **Следующие меры являются ключевыми компонентами эффективной программы ПОД:** * **Надлежащая проверка клиентов (CDD)**: прежде чем клиенту будет разрешено пользоваться услугами компании, он должен пройти тщательную надлежащую проверку клиентов. Этот процесс включает в себя получение и проверку информации о клиентах, например, их документов, удостоверяющих личность, и оценку того, представляют ли они какой-либо потенциальный риск участия в преступной деятельности. * **Расширенная комплексная проверка (EDD)**: в случаях, когда существует более высокий риск отмывания денег, компании обязаны применять меры расширенной комплексной проверки. Одним из наиболее важных элементов EDD является тщательная проверка источников средств клиентов, чтобы убедиться, что они не получены в результате незаконной деятельности. * **Непрерывный мониторинг клиентов**: это дополнительный уровень управления рисками, который включает в себя постоянный мониторинг транзакций клиентов и проведение периодических проверок для выявления и оценки любых подозрительных действий. * **Независимые аудиты AML:** эти аудиты позволяют предприятиям выявлять и устранять любые недостатки и недочёты в своих стратегиях соблюдения AML до проверок регулирующими органами, чтобы предотвратить санкции или штрафы. * **KYT или мониторинг транзакций:** мониторинг транзакций — это непрерывный процесс обеспечения безопасности, который позволяет компаниям обнаруживать и предотвращать подозрительные транзакции. Надёжная программная платформа KYT может выявлять необычные схемы, тщательно проверять сомнительные переводы и отслеживать транзакции в цифровой или фиатной валюте. Это помогает предотвращать и выявлять отмывание денег и другие финансовые преступления. ## Услуги [АМЛ консалтинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/) [АМЛ поддержка](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-podderzhka/) [AML обучение](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-obuchenie/) [АМЛ аутсорсинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-autsorsing/) [Индивидуальные решения для аудита AML для бизнеса](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-audit/) ОСТАВЬТЕ ЗАЯВКУ И ПОЛУЧИТЕ КОНСУЛЬТАЦИЮ * [Открытие банковских счетов](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/) + [По сферам](#) - [Для финансовых компаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-finansovyh-kompanij/) - [Для физических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-fizicheskih-lic/) - [Для юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-juridicheskih-lic/) - [Для криптокомпаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/otkrytie-schetov-dlja-kriptokompanij/) + [По странам](#) - [Открыть счет в ОАЭ (Дубай)](https://coredo.eu/ru/oaje-dubaj/) - [Открыть счет в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/avstrija/) - [Открыть счет в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/velikobritanija/) - [Открыть счет в Сингапуре](https://coredo.eu/ru/singapur-2/) - [Другие страны](/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/#countries) * [Регистрация юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) + [Разделы](#) - [Регистрация компании в Чехии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-chehii-2/) - [Регистрация компании в Словакии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-slovakii/) - [Регистрация компании на Кипре](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-na-kipre/) - [Регистрация компании в Люксембурге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ljuksemburge/) - [Регистрация компании в Гонконге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-gonkonge/) - [Регистрация компании в Эстонии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-jestonii/) - [Регистрация компании в Греции](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-grecii/) - [Регистрация компании в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-velikobritanii/) - [Регистрация компании в Ирландии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-irlandii/) - [Регистрация компании в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-avstrii/) - [Регистрация компании в Испании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ispanii/) - [Другие страны](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) * [Инструменты для финансовых институтов](#) + [Разделы](#) - [Интернет эквайринг](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/internet-jekvajring/) - [Эмиссия карт](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/jemissija-kart-vypusk-debitovyh-kart/) - [SEPA/SWIFT, IBAN интеграция](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/sepa-swift-iban-integracii/) - [Паспортизация лицензий](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/pasportizacija-licenzij/) - [Программное обеспечение](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/programmnoe-obespechenie/) * [Бухгалтерское обслуживание](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/buhgalterskoe-obsluzhivanie/) * [Компании на продажу](https://coredo.eu/ru/kompanii-na-prodazhu/) * [О компании COREDO](https://coredo.eu/ru/o-kompanii/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Контакты](https://coredo.eu/ru/kontakty/) * [Общие положения и условия](https://coredo.eu/ru/uslovija-i-polozhenija/) * [Политика использования файлов cookie](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-ispolzovanija-fajlov-cookie/) * [Политика конфиденциальности](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-konfidencialnosti/) * [Объявление о политике информирования](https://coredo.eu/ru/obyavlenie-o-politike-informirovaniya-whistleblowing/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Подписаться на новости](#subscribe) * [Информационное предупреждение](https://coredo.eu/ru/informacionnoe-preduprezhdenie/) * [Словарь](https://coredo.eu/ru/dictionary/) [+420 228 886 867](tel:+420 228 886 867 \"Phone\") [info@coredo.eu](mailto:info@coredo.eu \"Email\") K Cervenemu dvoru 3269/25a, Прага, 130 00, Чехия [Карта сайта](https://coredo.eu/ru/karta-sajta/) © 2025 Авторские права ©RES JUDICATA s.r.o.

[ENG](http://din-eka.com/ \"Switch to english version\") Прозрачность и подотчетность - ключевые аспекты современного корпоративного управления ====================================================================================== 07.06.2024 11:50 ![Image 2](https://dineka.ru/upload/medialibrary/6cf/6cfb199dfe2492feb845e128005e447d.png) Многие страны ввели законодательные изменения, направленные на повышение прозрачности корпоративного управления. Эти меры помогают бороться с финансовыми преступлениями, коррупцией и улучшить деловую репутацию компаний на международной арене. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты этих изменений и их влияние на бизнес. ##### Международные изменения в законодательстве * **AMLD в ЕС** Директива Европейского Союза по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AMLD) представляет собой серию мер, направленных на усиление прозрачности и подотчетности. Последние изменения включают требования к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах, создание централизованных регистров и обязательное сообщение о подозрительных транзакциях. Эти меры направлены на предотвращение отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма. * **Законы о корпоративной прозрачности в США** В США Законы о корпоративной прозрачности, такие как Закон о корпоративной прозрачности 2020 года (Corporate Transparency Act), требуют от компаний раскрытия информации о своих конечных бенефициарных владельцах в FinCEN. Это помогает правительственным органам бороться с незаконными финансовыми операциями и повышает уровень корпоративной подотчетности. * **Инициативы G20** Инициативы G20 включают в себя автоматический обмен информацией о финансовых счетах между странами-членами. Это значительно усложняет уклонение от уплаты налогов и способствует более прозрачной и справедливой налоговой системе. Эти меры также включают рекомендации по внедрению стандартов прозрачности и подотчетности на национальном уровне. ##### Международные стандарты и рекомендации Для повышения прозрачности и подотчётности в корпоративном управлении, а также для борьбы с финансовыми преступлениями, на международном уровне были разработаны и внедрены несколько ключевых стандартов и рекомендаций. Рассмотрим их подробнее. * **Директивы FATF** Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (FATF) разрабатывает международные стандарты по борьбе с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. Рекомендации FATF включают требования к идентификации клиентов, мониторингу транзакций и отчетности о подозрительных действиях. * **OECD Guidelines** Руководящие принципы Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (OECD) по корпоративному управлению включают рекомендации по прозрачности, подотчетности и соблюдению этических стандартов. Эти принципы помогают компаниям улучшить свои управленческие практики и повысить доверие со стороны заинтересованных сторон. * **ISO 37001** ISO 37001 — международный стандарт по системам управления антикоррупционной деятельностью, который предоставляет руководство по предотвращению, выявлению и реагированию на коррупцию. Внедрение этого стандарта помогает компаниям минимизировать риски коррупции и повысить уровень корпоративной этики. ##### Новые вызовы для корпоративного управления Компании должны уделять больше внимания процессам проверки и утверждения своих контрагентов. Это связано с усилением требований к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах и топ-менеджерах, которые могут оказывать значительное влияние на деятельность компании. В частности, внимание уделяется следующим аспектам: * Окончательные владельцы (UBO). В законодательстве многих стран усилились требования по раскрытию информации о физических лицах, которые в конечном итоге контролируют компанию. Это помогает бороться с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. * Профессиональные CEO. Компании должны убедиться, что их руководители обладают не только профессиональными навыками, но и соответствуют высоким стандартам этики и подотчётности. * Значимые бенефициары. Необходимо учитывать влияние значимых бенефициаров на стратегические решения компании и обеспечить их прозрачность. ##### Почему это важно? Проверка контрагентов и раскрытие информации о них имеет несколько ключевых преимуществ: * **Снижение рисков.** Компании могут лучше защищаться от финансовых преступлений и коррупции, зная, кто именно контролирует их контрагентов. * **Укрепление репутации.** Прозрачность и подотчётность повышают доверие инвесторов и партнёров. * **Соблюдение законодательства.** Соблюдение международных и национальных требований помогает избежать штрафов и юридических проблем. * **Улучшение бизнес-отношений.** Прозрачные процедуры способствуют укреплению доверия и партнёрских отношений. ##### Санкции за несоблюдение требований Компании, не соблюдающие требования по раскрытию информации и проверке контрагентов, могут столкнуться с серьезными санкциями: * **Финансовые штрафы.** Значительные денежные штрафы, налагаемые регуляторами. * **Юридические последствия.** Судебные разбирательства и уголовные преследования. * **Репутационные потери.** Потеря доверия и деловой репутации. Вот несколько интересных примеров как недостаточные проверки привели к серьёзным потерям: * **Airbnb и незаконная сдача жилья в аренду** В 2020 году компания Airbnb столкнулась с юридическими проблемами в Германии из-за того, что не проверяла легальность сдачи жилья в аренду. Власти Берлина обвинили компанию в том, что она позволяла сдавать квартиры без соответствующих разрешений, что нарушало местные законы о краткосрочной аренде. В результате Airbnb пришлось заплатить значительные штрафы и изменить свои процедуры проверки арендодателей, чтобы соответствовать местным законам. Этот случай подчеркивает важность проверки соответствия контрагентов местным законодательным требованиям. * **Standard Chartered и отмывание денег** В 2019 году банк Standard Chartered был оштрафован на 1,1 миллиарда долларов за нарушение законов о борьбе с отмыванием денег в США и Великобритании. Расследование показало, что банк не проводил достаточную проверку своих клиентов и их транзакций, что позволило преступным организациям отмывать деньги через его счета. Недостаточная проверка привела к финансовым и репутационным потерям для банка и подчеркнула необходимость строгих процедур соблюдения норм по борьбе с отмыванием денег. * **Danske Bank и скандал с отмыванием денег** В 2018 году Danske Bank оказался в центре одного из крупнейших скандалов с отмыванием денег в Европе. Через эстонское подразделение банка прошло около 200 миллиардов евро подозрительных транзакций. В результате банк был оштрафован на сотни миллионов долларов, его руководство подверглось серьезной критике, и банк понес огромные репутационные потери. Расследование показало, что банк не проверял должным образом своих клиентов и не проводил адекватный мониторинг транзакций. * **Volkswagen и нарушение требований по проверке поставщиков** В 2015 году разразился скандал с Volkswagen, когда выяснилось, что компания использовала программное обеспечение для обхода экологических тестов на выбросы. Расследование показало, что компания недостаточно проверяла своих поставщиков и производителей компонентов, что позволило этим нарушениям оставаться незамеченными. Скандал привел к штрафам на миллиарды долларов и нанес серьёзный ущерб репутации компании. ##### Выводы Современные требования к проверке контрагентов и раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах требуют от компаний пересмотра своих внутренних процессов и структур. Прозрачность и подотчётность становятся неотъемлемыми элементами успешного корпоративного управления. Внедрение этих изменений не только поможет компаниям соответствовать законодательным требованиям, но и укрепит их позиции на рынке, повышая доверие со стороны инвесторов и партнёров. Внедрение новых стандартов корпоративного управления и проверок контрагентов играет ключевую роль в глобальной борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями. Более строгие процедуры помогают выявлять и предотвращать попытки отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма (с) Деловой центр \"ДИНЕКА\" Д.Е.

finance, les gatekeepers tels que les comptables et les avocats sont censés se prémunir contre la criminalité financière. Pourtant, ces mêmes acteurs peuvent parfois devenir des partenaires involontaires, voire complices, de systèmes de blanchiment d\\'argent. L\\'expertise qui rend ces professionnels indispensables aux entreprises offre également aux criminels la possibilité de les exploiter dans le cadre d\\'activités illicites. Dans cet article, nous examinerons comment ces intermédiaires peuvent être utilisés pour blanchir des fonds illégaux, la législation relative aux gatekeepers et à la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, ainsi que des exemples concrets d\\'utilisation de ces intermédiaires à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent. Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'un gatekeeper ? ---------------------------- Un **gatekeeper** est une personne ou une entité qui contrôle l\\'accès à quelque chose, agissant souvent comme une barrière ou un filtre entre différentes parties. Dans divers contextes, les gatekeepers ont l\\'autorité ou la responsabilité de réglementer, de gérer ou de contrôler l\\'entrée, la participation ou le flux d\\'informations ou de ressources. ![Image 10: Gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-lawyers.png) Dans le **contexte financier et juridique**, les gatekeepers sont des professionnels tels que des comptables, des avocats, des banquiers, des auditeurs et d\\'autres experts chargés de garantir l\\'intégrité et la légalité des transactions et des activités financières. Quelles sont les tâches des gatekeepers dans le cadre de la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent ? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Le rôle du [gatekeeper dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux](https://febelfin.be/media/pages/publicaties/2021/banken-gatekeepers-in-de-strijd-tegen-witwassen/23291479c0-1694763198/brochure_aml_en.pdf)implique un devoir de vigilance permanent tout au long de la relation d\\'affaires : * 1 **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Comprendre parfaitement l\\'identité et les antécédents du client. Cela se fait généralement lors de l\\'onboarding de nouveaux clients, afin de s\\'assurer que leurs activités sont conformes aux normes juridiques et éthiques. * 2 **Know Your Transaction (KYT)**: Contrôler et comprendre la nature des transactions du client. Le KYT permet d\\'identifier les transactions suspectes ou inhabituelles qui peuvent indiquer une activité illicite, telle que le blanchiment d\\'argent, en signalant les incohérences par rapport au comportement attendu. * 3 **Vérifier l\\'origine des actifs**: S\\'assurer que les actifs impliqués dans les transactions proviennent de sources légitimes. Cela devient particulièrement important lorsque les transactions ou les transferts d\\'actifs d\\'un client sont anormaux ou ne correspondent pas à ses antécédents financiers. * 4 **Risk-Based Approach**: mise en oeuvre de mesures fondées sur le niveau de risque associé à chaque client et à chaque transaction. Les clients ou les transactions considérés comme présentant un risque plus élevé, tels que ceux impliquant des transferts de grande valeur ou des [personnes politiquement exposées (PPE)](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/personne-politiquement-expos%C3%A9e-ppe/), font l\\'objet d\\'une vigilance accrue, tandis que les clients présentant un risque moins élevé peuvent faire l\\'objet de contrôles moins stricts. * 5 **Respecter les embargos financiers**: Respecter les restrictions légales sur les transactions financières avec certaines entités ou certains pays. La conformité est essentielle pour éviter les sanctions et empêcher la facilitation des transactions illicites. * 6 **Limiter l\\'utilisation de l\\'argent liquide**: La limitation des transactions en espèces est une mesure essentielle dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, car l\\'argent liquide est difficile à retracer et est couramment utilisé dans les activités illicites. * 7 **Obligations de déclaration**: Les professionnels désignés sont légalement tenus de signaler aux autorités compétentes, telles que la cellule de renseignement financier (CRF) locale, toute activité suspecte susceptible d\\'indiquer un blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'autres délits financiers. * 8 **Conformité et adaptation continue**: Les gatekeepers doivent se tenir au courant des best practices, réviser les protocoles internes et s\\'assurer qu\\'ils sont bien formés pour reconnaître et traiter les risques liés au blanchiment d\\'argent et à la criminalité financière. Comment les gatekeepers sont-ils utilisés pour le blanchiment d\\'argent ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Les gatekeepers sont utilisés de diverses manières pour contribuer au blanchiment d\\'argent pour le compte de criminels. En voici quelques exemples : **Rôle des professionnels du domaine légal** **Création de sociétés écrans**: Les avocats sont souvent utilisés pour créer des sociétés écrans et des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui dissimulent la propriété et l\\'origine des fonds. Les avocats peuvent concevoir des structures de sociétés à plusieurs niveaux avec des entités dans différentes juridictions, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux d\\'argent ou d\\'identifier les véritables propriétaires. [![Image 11: Gatekeepers and shell companies](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg) **Transactions immobilières**: Les avocats jouent un rôle essentiel dans l\\'[organisation des transactions immobilières](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/comment-blanchir-argent-de-immobilier-aml/), la gestion des contrats et le respect des exigences légales et réglementaires. Les criminels exploitent souvent cette possibilité en achetant des propriétés de grande valeur avec de l\\'argent blanchi, ce qui leur permet d\\'intégrer ces fonds illicites dans l\\'économie légitime. [![Image 12: Gatekeepers and real estate](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg) **Rôle des comptables et des auditeurs** **Manipulation des états financiers**: Les comptables peuvent se livrer à des activités frauduleuses en falsifiant les documents financiers pour masquer la véritable nature des fonds. Ils peuvent gonfler les chiffres d\\'affaires en créant de fausses transactions commerciales, en émettant de fausses factures ou en enregistrant des ventes inexistantes afin de donner une fausse image de la santé financière d\\'une entreprise. En outre, ils peuvent manipuler les flux de revenus en fabriquant des revenus provenant de produits ou de services inexistants. [![Image 13: Gatekeepers and financial statement manipulation](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg) **Les stratagèmes d\\'évasion fiscale**: Les comptables peuvent s\\'engager dans des pratiques telles que la fabrication de dépenses et la sous-déclaration de revenus pour créer un profil financier trompeur. Cette manipulation permet non seulement [de réduire les obligations fiscales](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-and-crime.html), mais contribue également à la mise en place d\\'une structure complexe qui rend de plus en plus difficile l\\'identification de la véritable source des fonds. [![Image 14: Gatekeepers and illegal tax schemes](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg) Quels sont les exemples d\\'utilisation de gatekeepers à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent ? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au Canada, plusieurs avocats ont été impliqués dans des affaires de blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'activités financières suspectes, mettant en évidence leur rôle involontaire ou délibéré dans la facilitation d\\'opérations criminelles. Parmi les cas les plus marquants, on peut citer : * **Simon Rosenfeld**, un avocat de Toronto qui a [été condamné en 2005](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/5-canadian-lawyers-accused-of-money-laundering-or-suspicious-financial-transactions-1.6942083) après s\\'être vanté auprès d\\'un agent infiltré du laxisme du Canada en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. Sa peine a été alourdie en appel. * **Florence Yen**, une avocate spécialisée dans l\\'immobilier à Vancouver, qui a été suspendue pendant trois mois en 2021 pour avoir manipulé plus de 14 millions de dollars provenant d\\'un client sans fournir de services juridiques ni enquêter sur l\\'origine des fonds. * **Ronald Pelletier**, radié du barreau en 2023, pour avoir déplacé 31 millions de dollars pour le compte de clients impliqués dans des fraudes boursières aux États-Unis, en utilisant des téléphones à mémoire cachée pour dissimuler ses activités. En Europe, le [scandale de la Danske Bank en 2018](https://www.euronews.com/2022/12/14/danske-bank-fined-470m-over-international-money-laundering-scandal) est un cas bien connu d\\'avocats ayant permis le blanchiment d\\'argent. Ce scandale a révélé le rôle des professionnels, y compris des avocats, dans la facilitation du blanchiment d\\'environ 200 milliards d\\'euros de fonds suspects par l\\'intermédiaire de la succursale estonienne de la banque entre 2007 et 2015. Les avocats ont abusé du contrôle réglementaire indulgent de l\\'Estonie et ont créé des sociétés écrans avec des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui impliquaient des transactions transfrontalières. Quelle est la réglementation en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les gatekeepers ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La législation visant à réglementer les gatekeepers comprend des dispositions qui exigent de ces professionnels qu\\'ils mettent en oeuvre de solides mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux (AML) et qu\\'ils signalent les activités suspectes. Voici quelques cadres législatifs et mesures clés : **Union européenne** ![Image 15: EU AML directive gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-europe-eu.png) L\\'[Union européenne a adopté plusieurs directives](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/eu-directives-anti-blanchiment/) (e.g. la 4e et 5e directive AML) qui fixent des exigences en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les personnes chargées du contrôle et d\\'autres professionnels. Il s\\'agit notamment d\\'obligations en matière d\\'évaluation des risques, de vigilance à l\\'égard des clients et de déclaration des transactions suspectes. Les gatekeepers jouent un rôle essentiel en veillant à ce que les entreprises tiennent des registres précis de leurs structures de propriété. Ils sont chargés de faciliter le respect des réglementations qui exigent que ces informations sur la propriété soient accessibles aux autorités compétentes et aux entités obligées. La cinquième directive anti-blanchiment souligne encore cette responsabilité en exigeant que les informations relatives à la propriété soient mises à la disposition des personnes et des entités ayant un intérêt légitime. **États-Unis d\\'Amérique** Le Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) exige des entités de contrôle qu\\'elles établissent et maintiennent des programmes efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, qu\\'elles fassent preuve de diligence à l\\'égard des clients, qu\\'elles établissent des déclarations sur les activités suspectes (SAR) et qu\\'elles se conforment à d\\'autres exigences en matière de rapports. La loi prévoit également des sanctions en cas de non-respect de ces obligations. Les gatekeepers sont également tenus d\\'établir un rapport sur les transactions en devises (CTR) pour tout dépôt, retrait, échange de devises ou autre paiement ou transfert impliquant plus de $10.000 en espèces ou plus au cours d\\'une même journée. ![Image 16: Currency transaction reports for gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-transactions.png) Il existe également la [Gatekeeper Initiative](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminaljustice/gatekeeper_faq.pdf), une initiative gouvernementale visant à imposer des exigences strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent et le financement du terrorisme aux principaux professionnels qui agissent en tant que gatekeepers des systèmes financiers nationaux et internationaux. **Groupe d\\'action financière (GAFI)** Le GAFI reconnaît le rôle essentiel que jouent les gatekeepers dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Il encourage les pays à appliquer ses recommandations concernant les gatekeepers dans le cadre de leurs lois et réglementations nationales, afin de renforcer le cadre général de la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Dans l\\'[examen horizontal de la conformité technique des entités de contrôle en matière de corruption](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/Gatekeeper-TC-Corruption.html) réalisé en 2024, il a été noté que si de nombreux membres du GAFI ont obtenu un score supérieur à 80 % en ce qui concerne l\\'application des recommandations du GAFI sur les entités de contrôle, sept grandes économies - représentant plus de la moitié du PIB mondial - ont obtenu un score inférieur à 50 %. Des obligations essentielles telles que le devoir de vigilance à l\\'égard de la clientèle restent faibles. Il est nécessaire de maintenir un contrôle et un équilibre sur les gatekeepers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Les gatekeepers sont essentiels au système financier, et leur rôle et expertise peuvent être exploités par les blanchisseurs d\\'argent pour intégrer, superposer et finalement légitimer des fonds illicites. C\\'est pourquoi il est essentiel d\\'imposer à ces professionnels des obligations strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. ![Image 17: Gatekeepers and KYC](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-kyc.png) Des mesures efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, notamment des procédures de connaissance du client (KYC), le suivi des transactions et la déclaration des activités suspectes, permettent de s\\'assurer que les gatekeepers constituent une barrière plutôt qu\\'un canal pour les activités de blanchiment d\\'argent. Pour empêcher les gatekeepers de faciliter le blanchiment de capitaux, il faut adopter une approche globale impliquant l\\'application de la réglementation, des contrôles internes rigoureux et une surveillance proactive. En mettant en oeuvre ces stratégies, nous pouvons renforcer les défenses du système financier contre le blanchiment de capitaux et veiller à ce que les gatekeepers remplissent leur rôle essentiel dans la prévention de la criminalité financière.

The case marks a profound turning point for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in the banking sector. The exposure of the scandal revealed that billions of euros were laundered through its Estonian branch. It turned out that the existing AML control mechanisms were far from sufficient to prevent such illegal activities. This realization sparked a compliance revolution aimed at preventing future system failures and preserving the integrity of the financial market. ## The Exposure of a Gigantic Money Laundering Network The Danske Bank scandal embodies one of the most severe cases of money laundering within the European banking sector. The revelation that the bank\\'s Estonian branch served as a hub for dubious money flows caused significant uproar. It painted a picture of convoluted transaction paths, the ends of which were shrouded in darkness. The uncovering of the scandal provided initial hints at this. Over the years, funds amounting to more than 200 billion euros with suspicious origins found their way through the financial institution. Between 2007 and 2015, money laundering activities took place through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. The scale and complexity of these activities were only fully understood after intense investigations. Thousands of suspicious transactions, involving billions of dollars, were carried out without the necessary AML controls being effective. The Danske Bank affair has exposed the Achilles\\' heel of the financial world: effective mechanisms to prevent money laundering are not only desirable but vital for the integrity of the entire banking system. Internal security systems should be capable of identifying and reporting such massive movements. However, at Danske Bank, these systems failed entirely. This realization has highlighted an urgent need for a profound transformation in the approach to combating money laundering in the European banking sector. Key aspects: * Identification of opaque money flows * Failures in the internal control system * Revision of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) guidelines The significance of the case is partly due to the involvement of a well-known bank: Danske Bank. This has severely impacted its trust among customers and within the financial world. The case prompted a detailed investigation of the incident, scrutinizing the corporate culture and the compliance structure, which proved inadequate for managing money laundering risks. | **Area** | **Description** | **Consequence** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Revelation** | Fake customers and suspicious money flows | Stricter AML regulations and monitoring | | **Financial Volume** | Over €200 billion in suspicious transfers | Investigations and penalties | | **Control Systems** | Failure in detection and reporting | Concerns about risk management infrastructure | | **International Impact** | Affects the reputation of the entire European banking sector | Loss of trust and demands for transparency | ## ## **Scale and Consequences of the Money Laundering Affair** Following the revelation of the money laundering affair, the financial world is now focused on its enormous scope and severe consequences. The suspicious transactions that were uncovered shed light on the existing regulatory deficits in the banking sector and the necessity for effective anti-money laundering measures. ### **Dimensions of the Scandal** The dimensions of the affair are staggering: A gigantic volume of suspicious money transactions remained undetected for years. This indicates that both the financial supervision and the internal control mechanisms of the affected institutions failed. It is clear that despite existing regulations, there was a lack of consistent implementation. ### **Responses from the Financial World and Regulators** The response from the European Central Bank and national financial regulatory authorities was a comprehensive suite of actions. Their measures ranged from tightening regulatory protocols to discussions about ethical responsibility in the financial sector. These incidents have led to a rethinking and the development of new strategies in the fight against money laundering to restore public trust. ### **Economic and Reputational Damage** The reputational damage is immense. The affected bank not only struggled with losses in its stock value but also faced a profound crisis of confidence that questioned the credibility of the entire sector. The long-term effects of this crisis are not yet fully apparent. However, it is clear that comprehensive and sustainable reforms are necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future. These reforms are intended to bolster the integrity and accountability within the financial sector. ## **AML-Anti Money Laundering: Principles and Challenges** Combating money laundering, known as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), is a fundamental pillar in the financial sector. It aims to ensure the integrity and stability of the market. Banks and financial institutions are required to adhere to strict compliance guidelines to efficiently detect and prevent money laundering activities. Effective risk management plays a fundamental role in AML compliance. The identification, assessment, and management of risks are key elements in developing sustainable strategies against these threatening practices. Due diligence procedures, which involve the careful scrutiny of business partners, are also essential to counter potential threats and meet strict regulatory requirements. | **Basic Principle** | **Challenges** | **Strategies** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Customer Identification (KYC)** | Inefficiency in data collection | Automated verification systems | | **Transaction Monitoring** | False positive alerts | Refinement of algorithms | | **Due Diligence Procedures** | Lack of transparency | Extended due diligence checks | | **Suspicious Activity Reporting** | Timely capture of data | Training and clear procedural workflows | | **Risk Assessment** | Changing risk landscape | Dynamic risk models | The challenges in anti-money laundering are diverse and complex. Given the constantly changing methods of money laundering, financial institutions must remain agile and continuously adapt their AML systems. It is not only crucial to identify risks; comprehensive compliance guidelines are decisive in preventing future scandals. They help to strengthen public trust in the banking sector. ## **The European Context and the Role of Instant Payments** The money laundering activities of Danske Bank have exposed the interconnections within the European banking sector. It becomes clear that money laundering is not an isolated problem of a single institution. Rather, it represents a systemic risk that requires a coordinated response at the European and global level. In this context, the role of instant payments must be considered. On one hand, they accelerate payment transactions. On the other hand, they pose new challenges for AML compliance. The integration of effective AML controls into instant payment processes is crucial. ## The Role of Technology and Innovation in AML Compliance With the advent of disruptive technologies, the approach to risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements has fundamentally changed. In the fight against financial crimes such as money laundering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced AML technologies have become indispensable tools. They not only significantly enhance efficiency in AML processes but also contribute substantially to fraud detection and the prevention of financial crimes. ## Laws and Regulations for Combating Money Laundering **Switzerland** In Switzerland, money laundering is combated through the following laws and regulations: **Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG):** This law, applicable to financial intermediaries, regulates the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It also ensures due diligence in financial transactions. **Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GwV):** This ordinance regulates the professional practice of acting as a financial intermediary. It also sets out the supervisory and reporting obligations for traders. **FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GWV-FINMA):** This ordinance specifies how financial intermediaries must fulfill their obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. **EU** Money Laundering Directive: The EU\\'s Money Laundering Directive was enacted in 1991 and has been revised several times since then. The EU regulations aim to protect the EU\\'s financial system. It is the responsibility of each EU member state to transpose the Money Laundering Directive into national law. Regulation to Combat Money Laundering: In July 2021, the European Commission presented a package of legislative proposals. These proposals aim to further strengthen and improve the enforcement of EU regulations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT). The package envisages the establishment of an EU authority to combat money laundering, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for credit and financial institutions. Additionally, the package includes regulations on obligations of the private sector and a revised regulation on money transfers. **Germany** Money Laundering Act (GwG): The German Money Laundering Act is the legal implementation of the EU Directive of 2015 and aims at effectively prosecuting money launderers. It has been revised multiple times and has been in its current version since July 2, 2023. Criminal Code (StGB): According to § 261 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), \"money laundering\" is punishable in Germany. Individuals who conceal, use, or dispose of unlawfully acquired assets are committing a criminal offense. The Role of Regulatory Authorities Regulatory authorities such as the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) play a central role in combating money laundering in Switzerland. Similarly, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) plays a crucial role in combating money laundering in Germany. They are responsible for monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations at banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions. Independent asset managers and trustees in Switzerland are indirectly supervised through the Supervisory Organization (SO) by the regulatory authority (AO). In addition, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) exist here, which non-prudentially supervised financial service providers must join. The SROs are in turn approved and supervised by FINMA. In Germany, BaFin also pursues a preventive approach to combating money laundering. The BaFin regulatory authority is supported by the Federal Office for Combating Financial Market Crime (BBF), established in October 2023, as a federal supervisory authority. It consolidates supervision, analysis, and criminal investigations into money laundering matters. The automated functionality of this tool provides a time- and resource-saving way to identify risks. At the same time, it allows the compliance team to focus more on strategic case management. This optimization of workflow ensures efficient use of relevant resources, while companies maintain the highest standards of compliance and risk prevention. ## Future Challenges in Combating Money Laundering The increasing digitization, growing global financial flows, and cryptocurrencies pose new challenges for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). As money laundering is a global issue, addressing it requires not only adapting existing control mechanisms but also enhanced international cooperation. In addition to ongoing adjustments to laws and regulations, there is a need to harmonize them across borders. Strengthening collaboration at the international level is crucial because criminals\\' methods are becoming more sophisticated. Criminals are now utilizing cryptocurrencies for money laundering, adding complexity to detection efforts. Authorities and investigators are placing high hopes on the use of new methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in combating money laundering. These new technologies will play a significant role in fraud detection and identifying anomalies in financial transactions. ## Conclusion The harrowing tale of the Danske Bank scandal has exposed a shocking truth about the banking sector, revealing the severe consequences of inadequate AML compliance. Numerous lessons have been drawn from this money laundering affair, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive control mechanisms and transparent financial flows. Banks are challenged not only to react to scandals but to proactively act as elements in the fight against criminal financial activities. The future of AML compliance will increasingly be shaped by digital innovations and the integration of advanced technologies. This requires investments in intelligent solutions capable of identifying and analyzing even the most sophisticated suspicions. The pursuit of a seamless compliance culture generates a growing demand for skilled professionals. These professionals must be trained not only in the analysis of large volumes of data but also in relationship-building and due diligence. Given the events surrounding the Danske Bank, the need for dynamic, adaptable, and internationally coordinated AML policies is evident. The pioneers for a secure banking world in the 21st century are institutions that consider transparency and integrity as part of their corporate philosophy. They view these values not only as legal requirements but as essential elements in restoring public trust. Together, the sector can create resilient structures that are resistant to the threats of financial crime. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening as a Solution The Pythagoras Transaction Screening module is the optimal solution for reviewing incoming and outgoing payments.

Согласно договоренности, полученные от США миллионы направляются на профилактику, выявление и расследование финансовых преступлений, включая отмывание денег, киберпреступления и финансирование терроризма. Соглашение одновременно укрепляет взаимодействие Эстонии и США в противодействии финансовым преступлениям и подчеркивает нашу совместную приверженность принципам правового государства во всем мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов курирует комиссия, в состав которой входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом конкурсном раунде поддержаны девять предложений на общую сумму 25,7 млн евро. Комиссия исходила из того, что проекты должны представлять собой логическое целое и усиливать потенциал не отдельных учреждений, а системно укреплять борьбу с финансовой преступностью. Целью является поддержка профилактики, совершенствование практик расследования, технологическая поддержка и устойчивое обучение. Это поможет обеспечить осведомленность специалистов, работающих в столь сложной сфере, о последних достижениях, рисках и технологических изменениях, а также способность успешно применять полученные навыки и знания. Инициативы нацелены на предупреждение коррупции, повышение осведомленности о финансовых мошенничествах, эффективное выявление, арест и конфискацию преступных доходов, наращивание потенциала в борьбе с киберпреступлениями, улучшение возможностей по выявлению и анализу доходов от криптоактивов, а также на укрепление финансового надзора для более эффективного противодействия отмыванию денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент полиции безопасности, Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция и все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. «То, что штрафные средства по делам об отмывании денег направляются на проекты по сокращению экономической преступности, имеет символическое значение. Поскольку финансовые преступления крайне специфичны, сложны и технически емки, особенно важно, что благодаря этим ресурсам мы сможем усилить возможности следователей, прокуроров и судей эффективно рассматривать такие дела», - сказала канцлер Министерства юстиции и цифровых дел Тийна Уудеберг. «Показательно и то, что часть средств направляется непосредственно на профилактику, в том числе создается стратегическая рамка для предотвращения коррупции», - добавила она. Канцлер Министерства внутренних дел Тармо Мийлитс отметил, что дополнительные ресурсы позволят совершить важный рывок в расследовании технически сложных, как правило требующих международного сотрудничества и наносящих большой ущерб киберпреступлений. «Доходы от киберпреступности занимают высокое место рядом с оборотом наркотиков и коррупцией, поэтому особенно важно опережать преступников на шаг в навыках, знаниях и технических возможностях», - подчеркнул он. «Не менее важно выстроить устойчивую систему обучения, чтобы развитие компетенций в расследовании финансовых преступлений стало одним из столпов борьбы с преступностью. Совместно реализуемые проекты сделают работу правоохранительных органов эффективнее, чтобы поиск, арест и конфискация имущества, связанного с преступлениями, были результативнее, а снижение прибыльности преступной деятельности - успешнее», - указал Мийлитс. Министерство финансов акцентировало внимание на наращивании потенциала Финансовой инспекции по предотвращению отмывания денег. «Благодаря проектам у налоговой службы появится возможность получать сведения о транзакциях с криптоактивами, чтобы взыскивать неуплаченные налоги и обмениваться данными для выявления связанных преступлений», - сказала канцлер Министерства финансов Мерике Сакс. «Очень хорошо, что проекты предусматривают и информирование общества, и профилактику, например, чтобы люди не становились жертвами финансовых мошенничеств», - подчеркнула она.

Кроме того, средства будут использованы для повышения осведомлённости о финансовых и киберпреступлениях, а также для развития процедур по аресту и конфискации преступных доходов, в том числе в рамках международного сотрудничества. Соглашение также укрепляет сотрудничество между Эстонией и США в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями и демонстрирует, что обе страны совместно отстаивают принципы правового государства во всём мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов координирует комиссия, в которую входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел Эстонии, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом туре проектов было поддержано девять инициатив на общую сумму 25,7 миллиона евро. При отборе комиссия исходила из принципа, что проекты должны образовывать логически связанное целое и усиливать потенциал не только отдельных учреждений, но и системно укреплять борьбу с финансовыми преступлениями. Целью было обеспечить, чтобы проекты способствовали как профилактике, так и совершенствованию следственной практики, технологической поддержке и устойчивой системе обучения. Это поможет гарантировать, что в столь сложной сфере работают специалисты, хорошо осведомлённые о последних тенденциях, рисках и технологических изменениях, и способные эффективно применять полученные знания и навыки. Проекты направлены на предотвращение коррупции, повышение осведомлённости о финансовом мошенничестве, улучшение выявления, ареста и конфискации преступных доходов, укрепление возможностей по борьбе с киберпреступностью, повышение потенциала по выявлению и анализу криптодоходов, а также на усиление финансового надзора для более эффективной борьбы с отмыванием денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются Прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент государственной безопасности (КАПО), Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция, а также все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. _Читайте по теме:_ [**Цахкна: Передача штрафных денег доказывает глубину

Der Fall markiert einen tiefgreifenden Wendepunkt für die Anti-Money Laundry (AML)-Richtlinien im Bankensektor. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals offenbarte, dass Milliarden von Euro durch die estnische Filiale gewaschen wurden. Es stellte sich heraus, dass die vorhandenen AML-Kontrollmechanismen bei weitem nicht ausreichten, um derartige illegale Aktivitäten zu unterbinden. Diese Erkenntnis löste eine Compliance-Revolution aus, um ein künftiges Versagen der Systeme zu verhindern und die Integrität des Finanzmarktes zu wahren.** ## Die Enthüllung eines gigantischen Geldwäsche Netzwerkes Der Danske Bank Skandal verkörpert einen der gravierendsten Geldwäsche-Fälle innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors. Hohe Wellen schlug die Enthüllung, dass die estnische Filiale der Bank als Drehscheibe für dubiose Geldflüsse diente. Es entstand ein Bild verschlungener Transaktionskosten, deren Enden sich im Dunklen verloren. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals gab erste Hinweise darauf. Über die Jahre hinweg fanden Gelder in Höhe von mehr als 200 Milliarden Euro mit verdächtiger Herkunft ihren Weg durch das Finanzinstitut. Zwischen 2007 und 2015 fanden Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten statt. Diese Aktivitäten erfolgten über die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank. Ihr Umfang und ihre Komplexität wurden erst nach intensiven Ermittlungen vollends verstanden. Tausende verdächtige Transaktionen, die Milliarden von Dollar umfassten, wurden durchgeführt, ohne dass die erforderlichen AML-Kontrollen greifen konnten. * Die Affäre um die Danske Bank hat die Achillesferse der Finanzwelt blossgestellt: Effektive Mechanismen zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche sind nicht nur wünschenswert, sondern überlebenswichtig für die Integrität des gesamten Bankwesens. Die internen Sicherheitssysteme sollten in der Lage sein, solch massive Bewegungen zu identifizieren und zu melden. Bei der Danske Bank versagten diese jedoch auf ganzer Linie. Diese Erkenntnis trägt dazu bei, dass ein dringender Bedarf für eine tiefgreifende Transformation des Geldwäschebekämpfung Ansatzes im europäischen Bankensektor offengelegt wurde. * **Kennzeichnung undurchsichtiger Geldflüsse** * **Rollen Versäumnisse im internen Kontrollsystem** * **Überarbeitung von AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Richtlinien** Die Brisanz des Falles liegt unter anderem in der Beteiligung einer namhaften Bank: der Danske Bank. Diese sieht ihr Vertrauen bei Kundinnen und Kunden sowie innerhalb der Finanzwelt stark in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Der Fall zog eine detaillierte Untersuchung des Vorfalls nach sich. Dabei wurden die Unternehmenskultur und die Compliance-Struktur unter die Lupe genommen. Sie haben sich als unzureichend für das Management von Geldwäscherisiken erwiesen. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Bereich** | **Beschreibung** | **Konsequenz** | | Enthüllung | Unechte Kunden und verdächtige Geldflüsse | Stärkere AML-Vorgaben und Überwachung | | Finanzielles Volumen | Über 200 Milliarden Euro verdächtige Transfers | Untersuchungen und Strafen | | Kontrollsysteme | Versagen bei der Erkennung und Meldung | Bedenken zur Risikomanagement Infrastruktur | | Internationale Wirkung | Betrifft Reputation des gesamten Europäischen Bankensektors | Vertrauensverlust und Forderung nach Transparenz | ## ## Ausmass und Folgen der Geldwäsche-Affäre Nach dem Bekanntwerden der Geldwäsche-Affäre stehen die enorme Tragweite und die schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen im Fokus der Finanzwelt. Die aufgedeckten verdächtigen Transaktionen werfen ein Licht auf das bestehende Regulierung Defizit im Bankensektor und die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Geldwäschebekämpfung. ### Dimensionen des Skandals Die Dimensionen der Affäre sind erschütternd: Ein gigantisches Volumen an verdächtigen Geldtransaktionen blieb über Jahre hinweg unentdeckt. Dies zeigt, dass die Finanzaufsicht und die internen Kontrollmechanismen der betroffenen Institute versagt haben. Dies macht deutlich, dass es trotz existierender Vorschriften an einer konsequenten Umsetzung mangelte. ### Reaktionen der Finanzwelt und Regulatoren Die Antwort der Europäischen Zentralbank und der nationalen Finanzaufsichtsbehörden war ein Arsenal an Reaktionen. Ihre Massnahmen reichten von der Verschärfung der Regulierungsmassnahmen bis hin zur Diskussion über ethische Verantwortung im Finanzsektor. Diese Vorfälle haben zu einem Umdenken geführt. Es wurden neue Strategien im Kampf gegen die Geldwäsche entwickelt, um das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit wiederherzustellen. ### Wirtschaftliche und Reputationsschäden Der Reputationsschaden ist gewaltig. Die betroffene Bank hatte nicht nur mit Wertverlusten ihrer Aktien zu kämpfen. Sie stand ausserdem vor einer tiefgreifenden Vertrauenskrise, die die Glaubwürdigkeit des gesamten Sektors in Frage stellte. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Krise sind noch nicht vollständig absehbar. Jedoch ist klar, dass umfassende und nachhaltige Reformen notwendig sind. Diese Reformen sollen ähnliche Vorfälle in der Zukunft verhindern. ## ## AML-Anti Money Laundering: Grundsätze und Herausforderungen Die Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche, bekannt als Anti-Geldwäsche (AML), ist eine zentrale Säule im Finanzsektor. Sie dient dazu, die Integrität und Stabilität des Marktes zu gewährleisten. Banken und Finanzinstitutionen sind hierbei angehalten, strikte Compliance-Richtlinien zu befolgen, um Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten effizient aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Ein wirksames **Risikomanagement** spielt eine grundlegende Rolle in der AML-Compliance. Die Identifikation, Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken sind Schlüsselelemente, um nachhaltige Strategien gegen diese bedrohlichen Praktiken zu entwickeln. Due-Diligence-Verfahren, die sorgfältige Überprüfung von Geschäftspartnern, sind ebenfalls unerlässlich, um potenzielle Bedrohungen abzuwehren und den strengen regulatorischen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Grundprinzip** | **Herausforderungen** | **Strategien** | | Kundenidentifizierung ([KYC](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/partner-screening/?hsLang=de)) | Ineffizienz bei der Datenerhebung | Automatisierte Verifizierungssysteme | | [Transaction Monitoring](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-monitoring/?hsLang=de) | Falsch-Positive Meldungen | Verfeinerung von Algorithmen | | Due-Diligence-Verfahren | Mangel an Transparenz | Erweiterte Due-Diligence-Checks | | Meldung von Verdachtsfällen | Zeitgerechte Erfassung | Schulungen und klare Prozessabläufe | | Risikobewertung | Veränderliche Risikolandschaft | Dynamische Risikomodelle | Die Herausforderungen in der Anti-Geldwäsche sind vielfältig und komplex. Angesichts ständig ändernder Methoden der Geldwäsche müssen Finanzinstitutionen agil bleiben und ihre AML-Systeme kontinuierlich anpassen. Nicht nur das Aufspüren der Risiken spielt eine entscheidende Rolle. Die ganzheitlichen Compliance-Richtlinien sind ausschlaggebend, um zukünftige Skandale zu verhindern. Sie tragen dazu bei, das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in den Bankensektor zu stärken. ## Der europäische Kontext und die Rolle der Instant Payments Die Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten der Danske Bank haben die Verflechtungen innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors offengelegt. Es wird deutlich, dass Geldwäsche kein isoliertes Problem einer einzelnen Institution ist. Vielmehr stellt sie ein systemisches Risiko dar, das eine koordinierte Antwort auf europäischer und globaler Ebene erfordert. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die Rolle von Instant Payments zu betrachten. Diese beschleunigen einerseits den Zahlungsverkehr. Andererseits stellen sie neue Herausforderungen für die AML-Compliance dar. Die Integration von effektiven AML-Kontrollen in Instant Payment-Prozesse ist von entscheidender Bedeutung. ## Die Rolle von Technologie und Innovation bei der AML-Compliance Mit dem Aufkommen disruptiver Technologien hat sich die Herangehensweise an das Risikomanagement und die Einhaltung von Compliance-Vorschriften grundlegend gewandelt. Bei der Bekämpfung von Finanzverbrechen wie Geldwäsche avancieren Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und fortschrittliche AML-Technologien zu unverzichtbaren Instrumenten. Sie bieten nicht nur eine deutliche Effizienzsteigerung in den AML-Prozessen, sondern tragen erheblich zur Betrugserkennung und zur Prävention finanzieller Delikte bei. ## Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Geldwäschebekämpfung #### Schweiz In der Schweiz wird die Geldwäscherei durch folgende Gesetze und Verordnungen bekämpft: [Geldwäschereigesetz (GwG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/de): Das für Finanzintermediäre geltende Geldwäschereigesetz regelt die Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei und Terrorismusfinanzierung. Ausserdem regelt es die Sicherstellung der Sorgfalt bei Finanzgeschäften. Geldwäschereiverordnung (GwV): Die Vorschriften für die berufsmässige Ausübung der Tätigkeit als Finanzintermediär werden in dieser Verordnung geregelt. Ebenso sind die Aufsichts- und Meldepflichten für Händlerinnen und Händler darin festgelegt. [Geldwäschereiverordnung-FINMA](https://www.finma.ch/de/ueberwachung/branchenuebergreifende-themen/geldwaeschereibekaempfung/#:~:text=Aufsichtsrechtliche%20Geldw%C3%A4schereibek%C3%A4mpfung,im%20Rahmen%20ihrer%20prudenziellen%20Aufsicht.) (GWV-FINMA): Diese Verordnung legt fest, wie Finanzintermediäre die Pflichten zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umsetzen müssen. #### EU Geldwäscherichtlinie: Die Geldwäscherichtlinie der EU wurde 1991 erlassen und seitdem mehrmals überarbeitet. Die EU-Vorschriften dienen dazu, das Finanzsystem der EU zu schützen. Jedem EU-Mitgliedstaat obliegt es, die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie in nationales Recht umzusetzen. Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche: Im Juli 2021 legte die Europäische Kommission ein Paket mit Gesetzgebungsvorschlägen vor. Diese Vorschläge zielen auf die weitere Stärkung und bessere Durchsetzung der EU-Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AML/CFT) ab. Das Paket sieht vor, eine EU-Behörde zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche zu errichten, die einen Regelungsrahmen für Kredit- und Finanzinstitute schaffen soll. Ausserdem enthält das Paket Verordnungen über Verpflichtungen des privaten Sektors und eine überarbeitete Verordnung über Geldtransfers. #### Deutschland Geldwäschegesetz (GwG): Das deutsche Geldwäschegesetz ist die rechtliche Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinie von 2015 und zielt auf eine wirksame strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Geldwäschern ab. Es wurde mehrmals überarbeitet und ist in der aktuellen Fassung seit dem 02.07.2023 in Kraft. Strafgesetzbuch (StGB): Laut § 261 des deutschen StGB ist „Geldwäsche“ in Deutschland strafbewehrt. Personen, die unrechtmässig erworbene Vermögenswerte verschleiern, nutzen oder verbringen, machen sich strafbar. #### **Die Rolle von Aufsichtsbehörden** Aufsichtsbehörden wie die Schweizer Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FINMA) spielen bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei in der Schweiz eine zentrale Rolle. Ähnlich ist es mit der deutschen Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), die in Deutschland eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche einnimmt. Ihnen obliegt die Überwachung der Einhaltung der Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche bei Banken, Wertpapierhäusern und weiteren Finanzinstituten. Unabhängige Vermögensverwalter und Trustees werden in der Schweiz über die Aufsichtsbehörde (AO) indirekt überwacht. Daneben existieren hier Selbstregulierungsorganisationen (SRO), denen sich nicht prudentiell überwachte Finanzdienstleister anschliessen müssen. Die SROs werden wiederum von der FINMA genehmigt und beaufsichtigt. In Deutschland verfolgt die BaFin ebenfalls einen präventiven Ansatz zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Der Aufsichtsbehörde BaFin steht das im Oktober 2023 gegründete Bundesamt zur Bekämpfung von Finanzmarkt-Kriminalität (BBF) als Bundesoberbehörde zur Seite. In ihm werden Aufsicht, Analyse und strafrechtliche Ermittlung in Sachen Geldwäsche gebündelt. Die automatisierte Funktionalität dieses Tools bietet eine zeit- und ressourcenschonende Möglichkeit zur Risikoidentifizierung. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht es dem Compliance-Team, sich verstärkt auf das strategische Fallmanagement zu fokussieren. Diese Optimierung des Arbeitsablaufs gewährleistet eine effiziente Nutzung relevanter Ressourcen und Unternehmen halten gleichzeitig höchste Standards in Bezug auf Compliance und Risikoprävention aufrecht. ## Zukünftige Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung Die zunehmende Digitalisierung, wachsende globale Geldströme und Kryptowährungen stellen Anti-Money Laundering vor neue Herausforderungen. Da sich Geldwäsche als globales Problem darstellt, erfordert dies nicht nur eine Anpassung bestehender Kontrollmechanismen, sondern mehr internationale Zusammenarbeit. Neben der laufenden Anpassung von Gesetzen und Vorschriften gilt es, diese über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu harmonisieren. Um die Zusammenarbeit auf internationaler Ebene zu verstärken. Dies ist notwendig, weil die Methoden von Kriminellen raffinierter werden. Inzwischen setzen sie Kryptowährungen für Geldwäsche ein. Grosse Hoffnungen verbinden Behörden und Fahnder mit dem Einsatz neuer Methoden wie der Künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und Machine Learning bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung. Bei der Betrugserkennung und Aufdeckung von Anomalien bei Finanztransaktionen werden die neuen Technologien eine wichtige Rolle spielen. ## Fazit Die unheilvolle Geschichte des Danske Bank Skandals hat eine schockierende Wahrheit über den Bankensektor aufgedeckt. Sie hat aufgezeigt, welche gravierenden Konsequenzen mangelnde AML-Compliance nach sich zieht. Aus dieser Geldwäsche-Affäre sind zahlreiche Lektionen gezogen worden. Diese Lektionen betonen die Bedeutung von umfassenden Kontrollmechanismen und transparenten Finanzströmen. Banken stehen vor der Herausforderung, nicht bloss als Reaktion auf Skandale zu handeln. Vielmehr müssen sie als proaktives Element im Kampf gegen kriminelle Finanzaktivitäten agieren. Die Zukunft der AML-Compliance wird zunehmend von digitalen Innovationen und der Integration fortschrittlicher Technologien geprägt sein. Dies erfordert Investitionen in intelligente Lösungen, welche in der Lage sind, auch die raffiniertesten Verdachtsmomente zu identifizieren und zu analysieren. Das Streben nach einer lückenlosen Compliance-Kultur erzeugt eine steigende Nachfrage nach Fachkräften. Diese Fachkräfte müssen sowohl in der Analyse grosser Datenmengen geschult sein, als auch verstärkt in Beziehungsarbeit und Due-Diligence-Prüfung. In Anbetracht der Ereignisse rund um die Danske Bank ist die Notwendigkeit von dynamischen, anpassungsfähigen und international abgestimmten AML-Richtlinien offensichtlich. Die Wegbereiter für eine sichere Bankenwelt im 21. Jahrhundert sind Institute, die Transparenz und Integrität als Teil ihrer Unternehmensphilosophie betrachten. Sie sehen diese Werte nicht nur als gesetzliche Anforderung. Das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit kann durch das kollektive Bemühen aller Beteiligten wiederhergestellt werden. Gemeinsam kann der Sektor zukunftssichere Strukturen schaffen. Diese Strukturen müssen widerstandsfähig gegenüber den Bedrohungen durch Finanzkriminalität sein. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening als Lösung Das Pythagoras [Transaction Screening](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-screening/?hsLang=de) Modul ist die optimale Lösung für die Prüfung ein- und ausgehender Zahlungen.

The AMLA requires FinCEN to pay an award of [**up to 30 percent of collected monetary sanctions**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/money_laundering_whistleblower_reward/) that it recovers in a judicial or administrative action brought under the Bank Secrecy Act that results in sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The SEC can also **[pay awards to whistleblowers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/sec-whistleblower-program/)** for disclosing a broker-dealer’s failure to file [suspicious activity reports](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/report_reference.pdf), maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program, or establish an adequate customer identification program. In addition, the SEC can take an enforcement action against a mutual fund for a violation of Rule 38a-1, which requires investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws by the funds, which includes the Bank Secrecy Act.

In December 2022, [Danske Bank agreed to pay $413 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-220) to settle charges that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading investors about its AML compliance program in its Estonian branch and failing to disclose the risks posed by the program’s significant deficiencies. Danske Bank has agreed to pay more than $2 billion as part of an integrated, global resolution with the SEC, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Denmark’s Special Crime Unit. And in February 2018, [U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank paid $613 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/u-s-bancorp-agrees-to-pay-528-million-over-money-laundering) in fines and forfeitures to settle charges that it failed to maintain adequate safeguards against money laundering. In particular, U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious and processed Western Union transactions for non-customers. ## **SEC and FINRA Continue to Prioritize Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** The SEC’s [2024 examination priorities](https://www.sec.gov/files/2024-exam-priorities.pdf) clarify that the SEC continues to focus on AML compliance: > The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies, to establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs that are tailored to address the risks associated with the firm’s location, size, and activities, including the customers they serve, the types of products and services offered, and how those products and services are offered. These programs must, among other things, include policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the BSA and its implementing rules; independent testing; and risk-based procedures to perform customer due diligence (as required by the Customer Due Diligence rule), which includes identifying and verifying the identity of customers and conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. Where appropriate, certain financial institutions must also file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. SARs can be used to detect and combat market manipulation, insider trading, Ponzi schemes, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and a variety of other illicit activities potentially violative of securities and other laws and regulations. > > **The Division will continue to focus on AML programs to review whether broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies are: (1) appropriately tailoring their AML program to their business model and associated AML risks; (2) conducting independent testing; (3) establishing an adequate customer identification program, including for beneficial owners of legal entity customers; and (4) meeting their SAR filing obligations.** > **Examinations of certain registered investment companies will also review policies and procedures for oversight of applicable financial intermediaries. Also, the Division will review whether broker-dealers and advisers are monitoring** **Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and ensuring compliance with such sanctions.** # **Broker-Dealer Anti-Money Laundering Requirements** The primary [anti-money laundering regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.210) for brokers or dealers require, among other things, the establishment and implementation of an anti-money laundering program, which includes, at a minimum: * Policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance; * Independent testing for compliance; * Monitoring of the operations and internal controls of the program; * Ongoing training for appropriate persons; and * Appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, which includes: + Establishing, documenting, and maintaining a written [Customer Identification Program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.220); and + Continuous monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. In the event that a broker-dealer identifies a suspicious transaction, the firm is [required to file a SAR](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.320) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In the SAR’s narrative section, broker-dealers must “[p]rovide a clear, complete and chronological description . . . of the activity, including what is unusual, irregular or suspicious about the transactions(s).” Broker-dealers violate federal securities laws (specifically, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8) when they: * Fail to file SARs; or * File inaccurate SARs (e.g., incomplete narratives, incomplete critical field information, incomplete identification of suspicious activity, etc.). These violations deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information that could be used to identify potential securities law and money laundering violations. # **SEC and FINRA AML Enforcement Actions** * In September 2023, the SEC iharged registered investment adviser DWS Investment Management Americas Inc. (DIMA or DWS), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, for its failure to develop a mutual fund Anti-Money Laundering program. To settle the charges, DIMA agreed to pay a total of [$25 million in penalties](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-194). The SEC’s [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/ia-6431.pdf) also found that DIMA caused such mutual funds’ failure to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect activities indicative of money laundering and to conduct AML training specific to the mutual funds’ business. * In September 2023, the SEC charged a registered representative at a registered broker-dealer with [failing to report suspicious and unusual transactions in a brokerage account](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-98418-s) of his long-time customer to the AML group of the brokerage firm where he worked, which caused the firm to fail to timely file a SAR in violation of the federal securities laws. * In May 2016, FINRA fined Raymond James & Associates and Raymond James Financial Services **[$17 million](https://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/finra-fines-raymond-james-us17m-206217)** for widespread violations related to their anti-money laundering programs. The violations stemmed from the firms’ failure to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering programs, which in turn precluded the firms from meeting their duty to prevent, detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity from at least November 2011 through June 2014. * In December 2016, FINRA fined Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC [**$16.5 million**](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/CreditSuisse_AWC_120516.pdf?utm_source=MM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NewsRelease_120516_FINAL) for “significant deficiencies” in its anti-money laundering program. According to FINRA, Credit Suisse’s program failed to effectively monitor/detect suspicious trading and money movements from at least January 2011 through December 2015. As a result, Credit Suisse was unable to determine whether to file required SARs. * In January 2015, Oppenheimer & Company paid [**$10 million**](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/33-9711.pdf) to settle an action by the SEC and FinCEN for failure to file SARs. According to the SEC’s complaint, Oppenheimer’s anti-money laundering program identified suspicious activity that needed to be “escalated” immediately. Specifically, the activity stemmed from an account that: “(i) was a foreign broker-dealer doing business in the U.S.; (ii) selling ‘low-priced stock’ on behalf of customers; and (iii) that it immediately wired the proceeds out of the Oppenheimer account.” Despite these and other red flags, Oppenheimer failed to file SARs with FinCEN. * In February 2016, the SEC fined E.S. Financial Services [**$1 million**](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-23.html) for violating anti-money laundering laws by “allowing foreign entities to buy and sell securities without verifying the identities of the non-U.S. citizens who beneficially owned them.” As mentioned, federal securities laws require broker-dealers to establish, document, and maintain a written Customer Identification Program. ## **SEC AML Enforcement** In a July 2023 Risk Alert, EXAMS staff observed certain weaknesses in OFAC compliance programs, including instances in which entities did not adopt or implement reasonable, risk-based internal controls for 1. following-up on potential matches with the sanctions lists and documenting the outcome of such follow-up; 2. performing periodic or event-based screening of existing clients or customers based on, among other things, changes in ownership or to the sanctions lists; and 3. conducting OFAC searches in a timely manner (or documenting that such searches were completed). The alert encourages registrants to review and strengthen the policies, procedures, and internal controls of their AML programs to further their compliance with federal AML rules and regulations, and to monitor for amendments, pursuant to the AMLA and the Corporate Transparency Act.

According to the SEC’s [complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-112.pdf), Alpine failed to adequately file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for at least 1,950 stock transactions that the firm flagged as suspicious. The SEC found that Alpine’s “records contained information reflecting material red flags of money laundering, securities fraud, or other illicit financial activities relating to its customers and their transactions,” and that Alpine “routinely and systematically failed to identify and report suspicious activity in its SAR filings.” The SEC charged Alpine with thousands of violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8, and sought an order requiring Alpine to pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, which provides for penalties ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 for each violation The SEC’s complaint reveals that the SEC also charged many of Alpine’s customers with federal securities laws violations, including violations relating to transactions that cleared through Alpine. ## **SEC Whistleblower Program Pays More than $1.8 Billion in Awards to Whistleblowers** In 2010, Congress created the [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) to “motivate those with inside knowledge to come forward and assist the Government to identify and prosecute persons who have violated securities laws and recover money for victims of financial fraud,” S.

The [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) has enabled the SEC to uncover significant investment fraud schemes and halt ongoing fraud.

About Battle Over Corporate Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/whistleblower-attorney-jason-zuckerman-quoted-battle-corporate-whistleblower-rules/) In 2020, the SEC announced that “Anti-Money Laundering” was on the agency’s [List of Examination Priorities](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/national-examination-program-priorities-2020.pdf). The SEC’s examination priorities “reflect certain practices, products, and services that [SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations] perceives to present potentially heightened risk to investors and/or the integrity of the U.S. capital markets.” In the priority list, the SEC clarifies that it will continue to scrutinize broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs by: * Examining the appropriateness and effectiveness of broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs; * Reviewing how broker-dealers are monitoring for suspicious activity; and * Assessing broker-dealers’ compliance with SAR requirements. In 2016, the SEC [announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/inside-the-national-exam-program-in-2016.html) that it would share more of its oversight responsibilities of the broker-dealer industry with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Since 2017, and in lockstep with the SEC, FINRA included “Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity Monitoring” on its [2020 Annual Regulatory and Examination Priorities Letter](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/communications-firms/2020-risk-monitoring-and-examination-priorities-letter). Both the SEC and FINRA have increased enforcement actions against broker-dealers for anti-money laundering program violations. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)(2) (the “SAR Rule”). Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. Id. Exchange Act Rule 17a-8 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission to comply with the reporting, record-keeping, and record retention requirements of the BSA. The failure to timely file a SAR as required by the SAR Rule is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act. * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=linkedin) * [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=twitter) * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=facebook) * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=tumblr) Categories: [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-program/), [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Protection Law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-protection-law/), [Money Laundering Whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [SEC Whistleblower Attorney](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-attorney/), [SEC Whistleblower Award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower cases](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-cases/), [SEC whistleblower lawyers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/), [SEC Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-program/), [SEC Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-rules/), [Uncategorized](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/uncategorized/), [Whistleblower Bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounties/), [whistleblower bounty](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounty/), [Whistleblower Rewards](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-rewards/) Tags: [AML compliance whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-compliance-whistleblower/), [AML whistleblower lawyer](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-whistleblower-lawyer/), [AMLA whistleblower law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/amla-whistleblower-law/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-bounties/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower reward program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-reward-program/), [anti-money laundering whistleblowing](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblowing/), [broker dealer fraud whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/broker-dealer-fraud-whistleblower/), [money laundering whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [reporting money laundering to SEC](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/reporting-money-laundering-to-sec/), [sec whistleblower award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-program/), [sec whistleblower rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-rules/) ### About the authors Matthew Stock is the Director of the Whistleblower Rewards Practice at Zuckerman Law.

Alors que les régulateurs financiers du monde entier ne cessent de souligner l'importance des protocoles AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CRS (Common Reporting Standard) et FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), certaines institutions commettent des erreurs, intentionnelles ou non, et s'exposent à des conséquences bien plus terrifiantes que prévu. Ces réglementations sont conçues pour assurer la sécurité, la transparence et la résistance du secteur financier aux activités illicites telles que le blanchiment d'argent, l'évasion fiscale et le financement du terrorisme. Cependant, la non-conformité entraîne souvent de lourdes sanctions pécuniaires, des perturbations opérationnelles et le spectre effrayant de la ruine de la réputation. Ce billet explore quelques-uns des exemples les plus alarmants d'institutions hantées par les coûts « effrayants » des manquements à la conformité et explique pourquoi le fait de donner la priorité au respect de la réglementation peut vous éviter une frayeur inattendue. ### Violations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent (LAB) constituent la première défense du secteur financier contre le blanchiment d'argent, le financement du terrorisme et d'autres activités économiques criminelles. Les réglementations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent obligent les institutions financières à mettre en œuvre des procédures rigoureuses, notamment des protocoles de connaissance du client (KYC), des systèmes de surveillance et des rapports sur les activités suspectes. En appliquant ces réglementations, des autorités comme le FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) aux États-Unis et divers régulateurs financiers européens visent à empêcher les criminels d'intégrer des fonds illicites dans le système financier légitime. Pourtant, malgré ces protocoles stricts, de nombreuses institutions ont connu des défaillances qui leur ont coûté cher en termes de finances et de réputation. Certaines des amendes les plus célèbres du secteur en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent rappellent ce qui peut se produire lorsque la diligence raisonnable n'est pas respectée. #### 1. HSBC – Un rappel de 1,9 milliard de dollars sur la négligence en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Dans le cadre de l'une des plus importantes amendes infligées en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, HSBC a été condamnée en 2012 à une pénalité stupéfiante de 1,9 milliard de dollars pour avoir enfreint les lois relatives à la lutte contre le blanchiment. Elle n'avait notamment pas mis en place de contrôles efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et avait traité des transactions pour des cartels de la drogue au Mexique et d'autres clients à haut risque. Le ministère américain de la justice, en collaboration avec le FinCEN et d'autres agences, a mené l'enquête, qui a mis au jour de graves lacunes en matière de diligence raisonnable à l'égard des clients, des contrôles internes inadéquats et des systèmes de surveillance médiocres. La négligence de HSBC a permis à des criminels de faire transiter des milliards de dollars par ses systèmes sans éveiller de soupçons. Les conséquences ont été terribles pour HSBC. Outre le coup financier, l'institution a dû faire face à une surveillance publique intense, à des batailles juridiques et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Elle a été contrainte de revoir ses procédures de conformité, d'investir des millions dans des technologies de conformité et d'embaucher des milliers de responsables de la conformité. Le nom de la banque, autrefois synonyme de fiabilité, a été associé à l'un des plus grands scandales de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent du secteur - une réputation obsédante qui a perduré longtemps après la sanction. #### 2. Danske Bank – Une toile de milliards blanchis Le scandale de blanchiment d'argent de la Danske Bank est un autre exemple notoire. Entre 2007 et 2015, la succursale estonienne de Danske aurait blanchi environ 230 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes, provenant principalement de clients russes. Bien que le scandale ait été rendu public en 2018, l'amende infligée par les régulateurs danois a rappelé le coût élevé des défaillances en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent. L'enquête a révélé que la banque ne disposait pas de contrôles suffisants, ce qui a permis à un réseau de criminels d'exploiter ses systèmes pour effectuer des transactions illicites. Les autorités de régulation danoises et estoniennes, ainsi que plusieurs organismes internationaux, ont jugé que la banque était complice de l'un des plus grands systèmes de blanchiment d'argent en Europe. Les répercussions ne se sont pas limitées à des amendes ; la Danske Bank a dû faire face à des poursuites judiciaires, à la contestation des actionnaires et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Des cadres supérieurs ont démissionné et la réputation de la banque a été fortement entamée, jetant une longue ombre sur ses opérations et ses relations avec les clients. Ce scandale a mis en évidence les dangers liés à la faiblesse des systèmes de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, illustrant comment le non-respect des protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent peut entraîner des dommages financiers et des atteintes à la réputation considérables. #### Analyse des manquements à la conformité : Les pièges courants de la lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les exemples de HSBC et de Danske Bank mettent en évidence les pièges les plus courants en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent : - Diligence insuffisante à l'égard des clients : Des clients insuffisamment contrôlés peuvent exploiter les systèmes financiers à des fins de blanchiment d'argent. - Faiblesse des contrôles internes : L'absence de cadres solides de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et de gestion des risques expose les institutions à l'exploitation criminelle. - Systèmes de surveillance inefficaces : En l'absence de suivi des transactions en temps réel et de détection des anomalies, les activités suspectes peuvent passer inaperçues. Dans les deux cas, l'absence de mesures de conformité et l'absence d'une culture de la conformité ont amplifié l'impact. Lorsque les institutions négligent le respect de la réglementation, elles s'exposent involontairement à des amendes substantielles et à des poursuites judiciaires. ### Sanctions et montages offshore La conformité financière est semée d'embûches coûteuses, en particulier en ce qui concerne les violations des sanctions et l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger. Les sanctions pour non-conformité dans ces domaines sont parmi les plus sévères, car les organismes de réglementation du monde entier appliquent des sanctions strictes pour dissuader les institutions financières de contourner les lois économiques ou de soutenir des activités illicites. Les sanctions américaines jouent un rôle essentiel dans la sauvegarde de la sécurité nationale en limitant les transactions financières avec les pays impliqués dans le terrorisme ou les violations des droits de l'homme. Les banques qui ignorent ou tentent de contourner ces restrictions s'exposent à de graves conséquences économiques et à des atteintes à leur réputation. #### 3. BNP Paribas - Une pénalité record de 8,9 milliards de dollars pour violation des sanctions En 2014, BNP Paribas (BNPP), l'une des plus grandes institutions financières françaises, a reçu une amende record de 8,9 milliards de dollars après avoir plaidé coupable d'avoir traité des transactions pour le Soudan, l'Iran et Cuba, des pays soumis à des sanctions américaines strictes. Cette amende massive a mis en lumière les conséquences de la conspiration pluriannuelle de la BNPP visant à contourner les lois américaines sur les sanctions et les stratagèmes élaborés par la banque pour éviter d'être détectée.La BNPP a utilisé des « banques satellites » et des entités sanctionnées déguisées dans des transactions pour contourner les sanctions, faisant transiter plus de 8,8 milliards de dollars par le système américain. Malgré les avertissements juridiques, la banque a poursuivi ces pratiques à des fins lucratives, notamment en soutenant des banques soudanaises liées au terrorisme. Cette situation a eu des répercussions importantes, notamment des amendes imposées par le ministère de la justice, la Réserve fédérale et l'OFAC, des poursuites pénales et une suspension d'un an des opérations de compensation en dollars. La BNPP a également dû licencier des cadres supérieurs et investir massivement dans des réformes de conformité. #### 4. Credit Suisse - Systèmes d'évasion fiscale offshore et pénalité de 1,8 milliard de dollars Le Crédit Suisse, une banque suisse à l'histoire mouvementée, a été impliqué dans l'aide apportée à des contribuables américains pour leur permettre d'échapper à l'impôt en dissimulant des actifs sur des comptes offshore. En 2014, la banque a plaidé coupable à une accusation de complot pour avoir aidé des clients américains à dissimuler leur fortune, ce qui lui a valu une amende de 1,8 milliard de dollars. Cette affaire a relancé l'examen mondial du rôle des banques suisses dans la facilitation de l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger et de l'efficacité des accords de plaidoyer pour prévenir les violations répétées.Un rapport de la commission des finances du Sénat a révélé que le Crédit suisse n'avait peut-être pas respecté l'accord qu'il avait conclu, en mettant en évidence les services qu'il avait rendus à des personnalités de premier plan comme Dan Horsky, qui avait dissimulé 220 millions de dollars par l'intermédiaire de membres de sa famille et de sociétés écrans. Des documents internes montrent que des banquiers chevronnés ont modifié les détails des comptes pour échapper à la surveillance de l'IRS en utilisant la double nationalité pour masquer l'identité des clients. Le rapport a également mis au jour des comptes non divulgués transférés vers d'autres banques, ce qui a suscité des appels en faveur d'une intensification des enquêtes sur le Credit Suisse et d'autres banques suisses. Ces révélations ont entaché la réputation du Credit Suisse et relancé la demande d'une application plus stricte de la FATCA et de la réglementation sur les déclarations à l'étranger, notamment en ce qui concerne les comptes à double nationalité et l'évasion fiscale. #### Les défis de la conformité : Pourquoi les institutions se débattent-elles avec les sanctions et les réglementations offshore ? La conformité aux sanctions et aux réglementations offshore est complexe pour les institutions financières, car elle exige des contrôles, une surveillance et des rapports rigoureux. Les défis à relever sont les suivants :- Contrôle des transactions : Un contrôle efficace est nécessaire pour empêcher les fonds d'atteindre les entités figurant sur la liste noire. Les tactiques de dissimulation de BNP Paribas mettent en évidence les risques de détection des pratiques occultes.- Questions relatives aux données sur les clients : La conformité offshore nécessite une identification précise des clients, en particulier pour les personnes ayant une double nationalité. La situation du Crédit Suisse a révélé des problèmes liés à une déclaration inadéquate de ces comptes.- Coordination transfrontalière : Les institutions doivent s'aligner sur les différentes réglementations mondiales et locales, comme l'a montré le Credit Suisse en gérant les protocoles de conformité entre les différentes juridictions.Les sanctions infligées à BNP Paribas et au Crédit Suisse montrent les graves conséquences des manquements à la conformité, et soulignent la nécessité d'une approche proactive de la conformité pour atténuer les risques financiers et les risques pour la réputation. ### Conclusion #### Éviter les coûts effrayants des violations de la conformité Les amendes faramineuses et les atteintes à la réputation constatées dans des affaires comme celles de HSBC, Danske Bank, BNP Paribas et Credit Suisse révèlent les enjeux considérables de la conformité financière. Ces histoires édifiantes rappellent aux institutions que les manquements en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, de sanctions ou de réglementations offshore sont coûteux et laissent une ombre durable sur la crédibilité d'une institution et la confiance de ses clients. Avec l'augmentation de la surveillance réglementaire et de la responsabilité publique, la conformité ne peut plus être considérée comme une simple fonction d'arrière-guichet - c'est un élément vital de l'intégrité opérationnelle et de la réussite stratégique.Les institutions financières doivent donner la priorité à des cadres de conformité rigoureux, investir dans des systèmes de contrôle de pointe et instaurer une culture de la responsabilité dans l'ensemble de leurs opérations. Ces mesures proactives sont essentielles pour éviter les conséquences « effrayantes » qui ont hanté d'autres acteurs du secteur. En s'engageant à respecter scrupuleusement les règles de conformité, les institutions se protègent contre de graves répercussions financières et juridiques et préservent leur réputation sur un marché mondial où la confiance et la transparence sont indispensables. #### Share: ### TWC Staff ### Related News [Conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/conformité) ### [08 | Simplifier la conformité dans les îles Caïmans](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [Article](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/article) ### [Fortnite: les achats dans le jeu et les violations de la vie privée entraînent des amendes massives](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [Blog](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/blog) ### [Briser les barrières : les femmes qui ouvrent la voie dans le domaine de la conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr)\", summary=\"Danske Bank was involved in a major money laundering scandal, where its Estonian branch allegedly laundered approximately $230 billion in suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015, mainly from Russian clients.

[Liberty Reserve](#headline_15) Finance UA Обновлено 11 июля 2024 Отмывание денег имеет серьезные далеко идущие негативные последствия для экономики, общества и целостности финансовой системы. Это уже давно глобальная проблема, которая угрожает финансовым системам и способствует росту преступной деятельности. По данным МВФ, уровень отмывания денег составляет 2−5% мирового ВВП. В причастности к таким действиям в последние годы были уличены известные банки, политики, знаменитости и компании. ## Что такое отмывание денег Прежде всего, разберемся подробнее, что означает отмывание денег. Это преступление, связанное с сокрытием или попыткой скрыть незаконное происхождение полученных средств. В рамках этого процесса человек или учреждение превращает незаконные средства в законные через сложные каналы. Деньги проходят различные этапы, включая конвертацию и перевод в официально признанное учреждение. Например, человек получил деньги путем преступной деятельности (мошенничество, торговля наркотиками, контрабанда оружия, терроризм и т. п.), а затем вливает эти средства на официальный рынок. Как это он делает? Покупает недвижимость, транспортные средства, компании и т. д., таким образом превращая их происхождение в законное. Тот, кто отмывает деньги, обходит финансовую систему страны и манипулирует ею, чтобы вводить и тратить неправомерно полученные деньги. Рассмотрим 5 громких историй с отмыванием денег, которые стали известны в последние годы и получили международный резонанс. ## «Панамские документы» Утечка «Панамских документов» (Panama Papers) в 2016 году стала монументальным разоблачением, которое обнародовало многочисленные резонансные случаи отмывания денег, уклонение от уплаты налогов и обход международных санкций. Утечка информации касалась банков, юридических фирм и чиновников во всем мире, раскрывая масштабы незаконной финансовой деятельности, скрытой через оффшорные банки и подставные компании. «Панамские документы» — это история с утечкой зашифрованных конфиденциальных документов, которые были собственностью панамской юридической фирмы Mossack Fonseca, специализирующейся на работе с оффшорами. Эти документы в апреле 2016 года опубликовала немецкая газета Süddeutsche Zeitung, назвав их «панамскими документами». Таким образом удалось разоблачить сеть из более 214 тыс. налоговых гаваней, в которые были привлечены люди и организации из 200 разных стран. В центре этих историй стоит Mossack Fonseca — панамский поставщик оффшорных компаний с десятками офисов по всему миру. Компания продает свои оболочки фирм в таких городах как Цюрих, Лондон и Гонконг. Mossack Fonseca является посредником для тех, кто хочет зарегистрировать компанию в «налоговом раю» и пользоваться льготами. Mossack Fonseca тесно сотрудничала с такими финансовыми гигантами как HSBC, Deutsche Bank и Credit Suisse, чтобы помочь их клиентам скрыть свои средства. Так, клиенты Mossack Fonseca могли приобрести анонимную компанию всего за 1 тыс. долларов. Но за эту цену можно получить просто пустую оболочку. За дополнительную плату Mossack Fonseca предоставляла фиктивного директора и при желании скрывала настоящего акционера компании. В результате возникает оффшорная компания, чья подлинная цель и структура собственности зашифрована извне. ### Кто из известных людей «засветился» в «Панамских документах»? **Бывший премьер-министр Исландии Сигмундюр Гюннлейгссон** Как выяснили журналисты, Гюннлейгссон прятал миллионы долларов инвестиций исландских банков в оффшорных компаниях. Согласно документам, Гюннлейгссон и его жена купили оффшорную компанию Wintris в 2007 году, однако не указали ее в декларации. В 2010 году исландский премьер продал 50% компании Wintris своей жене за 1 доллар. **Бывший премьер-министр Грузии Бидзина Иванишвили** Иванишвили скрыл от налоговой тот факт, что владеет компанией Lynden Management Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах, не зафиксировав ее ни в одной декларации. Через эту компанию Иванишвили и его партнеры контролировали около 20% акций американской фармацевтической компании Raptor Pharmaceuticals. **Бывший премьер-министр Иордании Али Абу Рагеб** Журналисты обнаружили, что за несколько месяцев до истечения своего срока в должности премьера Рагеб зарегистрировал оффшорную компанию Jaar Investment Ltd, открывшую счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. Кроме того, политик вместе с супругой стал директором Jay Investment Holdings Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. До декабря 2014 года Рагебу принадлежали три компании на Сейшельских островах, а его дети были привлечены как директора в нескольких других компаниях, в частности Desert Star Investment Capital Ltd, которая имела счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. **Бывший вице-президент Ирака Ияд Аллави** Согласно расследованию, в 1985 году Аллави зарегистрировал через Mossack Fonseca компанию I.M.F. Holdings Inc. В 2013 году общая стоимость ее активов составила 1,5 млрд долларов. Еще одна компания, которую Аллави не указал в своей декларации — Moonlight Estates Limited. **Отец бывшего премьер-министра Великобритании Дэвида Кэмерона** Покойный отец бывшего британского премьера Дэвида Кэмерон Иен Кэмерон помогал создать и развивать оффшорную компанию Blairmore Holdings Inc в 1982 году и был вовлечен в ее деятельность вплоть до своей смерти в 2010-м. В 1998 году Blairmore была оценена в 20 млн долларов. **Президент Азербайджана Ильхам Алиев** Алиев и его супруга в 2003 году купили компанию Rosamund International Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. Тогда Алиев был депутатом парламента, а позже вступил в должность президента. Следовательно, политик, указанный директором и совладельцем Rosamund International Ltd, нарушил закон, запрещающий президенту заниматься бизнесом. В 2008 году две дочери Алиева приобрели компании Arbor Investments, LaBelleza Holdings Limited и Harvard Management Limited. Директором этих трех фирм оказался предприниматель Хасан Гозал. Он вместе со своим братом Абдолбары владел десятью компаниями, входящими в холдинг Intersun, где Абдолбары был президентом, а Хассан — вице-президентом. Таким образом, холдинг Intersun получил несколько крупных контрактов от государственной нефтяной компании Азербайджана, где Алиев еще до главы государства был первым вице-президентом. **Король Саудовской Аравии Салман ибн Абдул-Азиз Аль Сауд** Согласно «Панамским архивам», через оффшорные компании король Саудовской Аравии владел яхтой и недвижимостью в Лондоне, которую оценили в 34 млн долларов. На имя монарха зарегистрирован ряд компаний, в том числе Safason Corporation SA SPF, Verse Development Corporation, InRow Corporation, Crassus Limited и Park Property Limited. **Футболист Лионель Месси** Согласно обнародованным данным, Месси и его отцу принадлежит оффшорная компания Mega Star Enterprises, зарегистрированная в Панаме. Впервые она была упомянута в архивах Mossack Fonseca еще 13 июня 2013 года. На следующий день испанская прокуратура выдвинула против обеих Месси обвинения в многомиллионных налоговых махинациях. **Ближайшее окружение российского диктатора владимира путина** В «Панамских архивах» были упомянуты четыре компании, связанные с россией — Sonnette Overseas, International Media Overseas, Sunbarn и Sandalwood Continental. Все они были зарегистрированы в оффшорах через Mossack Fonseca и связаны с окружением путина. Так, International Media Overseas и Sonnette Overseas принадлежали близкому другу диктатора россии виолончелисту Сергею Ролдугину. В расследовании также упоминаются оффшорные компании спикера диктатора рф Дмитрия пескова, министра экономического развития Алексея Улюкаева, сына российского олигарха и друга путина Игоря Ротенберга, и других российских политиков. Выведенная ими в оффшоры сумма на 2016 год могла достигать 2 млрд долларов. ## «Райские документы» В ноябре 2017 года журналисты Международного консорциума журналистских расследований (ICIJ) обнародовали данные тайных документов о налоговых лазейках и бизнес-контактах чиновников из 50 стран мира, в том числе и Украины. Эта утечка получила название «Райские документы» (Paradise Papers) и содержала данные госреестров полутора десятков экзотических островов, где регистрируют оффшорные компании. Речь идет о 13,4 млн финансовых документов с данными о том, как богатейшие люди и компании мира тайно вкладывают деньги в оффшорные зоны, чтобы «защититься» от налогов или сохранить секретность деловых соглашений. В материалах, охватывающих период с 1950-го по 2016 год, фигурируют имена более 120 мировых политиков. Среди самых громких имен в документах — покойная королева Великобритании Елизавета II, а также корпорации, такие как Nike, Apple и Facebook. Большая часть материала, а именно 6,8 млн документов, касается деятельности юридической фирмы Appleby, действовавшей в 10 различных юрисдикциях. Но в другой части речь идет об оффшорах корпораций, спортсменов и политиков во всем мире. **Королева Британии Елизавета II** По данным из «Райских документов», около 10 млн фунтов стерлингов из частного состояния королевы Елизаветы II были инвестированы в оффшоры. Деньги в фонды на Каймановых островах и Бермудах вкладывало Герцогство Ланкастерское, что обеспечивало королеву доходами и управляло инвестициями в пределах ее частной собственности в 500 млн фунтов стерлингов. **российский предприниматель Юрий Мильнер** «Райские документы» обнаружили «кремлевский след» в компаниях Facebook Inc. и Twitter Inc. По данным расследователей, один из важных инвесторов обеих компаний — фонд DST Global, принадлежащий российскому миллиардеру Юрию Мильнеру, был финансово связан с российскими госкомпаниями. Так, на деньги, полученные от ВТБ Банка, фонд Мильнера приобрел в 2011 году акции Twitter. Инвестиции же в Facebook фонда DST Global фактически профинансировала дочерняя компания «Газпрома» — «Газпром инвестхолдинг», которую возглавлял тогда бизнесмен Алишер Усманов. Мильнер и партнеры продали свои акции Facebook и Twitter в 2012 и 2013 годах. **Бывший министр торговли США Уилбур Росс** По данным документов, бывший американский министр через серию оффшоров имел долю в компании Navigator, тесно сотрудничавшей с газовой компанией Sibur. Совладельцем Sibur был муж дочери путина. **Apple** Благодаря некоторым особенностям законодательства в оффшорах Apple несколько лет не платила миллиарды налогов. В частности, до 2014 года компания использовала лазейку в налоговом законодательстве США и Ирландии, известную как double Irish. Это схема оптимизации налоговых обязательств посредством использования двух ирландских и одной нидерландской компаний. Она позволила Apple постоянно производить продажу за пределами Северной и Южной Америки — а это почти 55% дохода — через ирландские дочерние компании, которые фактически были оффшорами. Таким образом, компания не платила никаких налогов. **Nike** Компания снижала налоговые ставки через свой филиал в Нидерландах. Схема работала таким образом: когда человек покупал товар, например, в Лондоне, то деньги за него уходили в главную британскую дочернюю компанию Nike. Затем денежные средства поступали в Нидерланды, где расположена штаб-квартира компании. В течение 2005−2014 годов компания могла перечислять деньги оттуда на Бермуды, где зарегистрирована ее «дочка» — Nike International Ltd. ## Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank Крупнейший банк Дании Danske Bank был замешан в масштабном скандале с отмыванием денег, связанном с подозрительными транзакциями примерно на 200 млрд евро через эстонский филиал. Скандал возник в 2018 году после раскрытия изоблачителем в эстонском отделении Danske, который сообщил, что банк проигнорировал признаки, указывающие на «потенциально преступные операции» по перемещению миллиардов долларов на Запад с 2008 по 2017 годы, в том числе от российских клиентов. Многие клиенты банка были компаниями с признаками фиктивности, зарегистрированными в Великобритании. Датская юридическая фирма Bruun&Hjejle провела проверку Danske Bank и пришла к выводу, что сотрудники банка сознательно могли быть соучастниками нелегальных операций. Также в банке не контролировалось отмывание денег, там не знали владельцев многих счетов и не имели автоматического мониторинга входных транзакций. Более того, банк даже не выяснял, находятся ли клиенты под санкциями. В 2022 году Danske Bank признал себя виновным в сговоре с целью совершения банковского мошенничества. Признал, что предоставлял банковские услуги подозрительным клиентам — в том числе и в стране-агрессоре — через свой эстонский филиал, хотя знал о рисках отмывания денег. ## Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом Американский политтехнолог, экс-глава избирательной кампании Дональда Трампа — Пол Манафорт был разоблачен и осужден за отмывание средств, полученных за работу консультантом украинской Партии регионов, ее лидера и экс-президента Украины Виктора Януковича, а также Оппозиционного блока. Манафорт вместе с коллегой Ричардом Гейтсом в период с 2006 по 2015 годы заработали в Украине десятки миллионов долларов. С целью скрыть эти деньги, они в течение 2006−2016 годов отмывали средства через многочисленные компании, партнерства и банки в США и других странах. Манафорт и Гейтс действовали как агенты правительства Украины, Партии регионов, Януковича, не задекларировав в США эту деятельность и заработанные вследствие нее средства должным образом. Заметим, что по американскому законодательству такая деятельность является лоббированием в пользу иностранного государства и требует государственной регистрации. По подозрениям ФБР, Манафорт получил от «Партии регионов» и от россии 80−100 млн долларов. По данным обвинения, политтехнолог использовал миллионы долларов незадекларированных и не облагаемых налогом средств для роскошной жизни и покупки дорогой недвижимости в США. То же делал и Гейтс, также помогавший Манафорту получать эти средства с оффшорных счетов. В общей сложности через эти оффшорные счета прошло более 75 млн долларов. В обвинительном акте Манафорта были перечислены десятки компаний, созданных им вместе с Гейтсом, и сотни денежных переводов от этих компаний в пользу обоих деятелей, использованные в их схеме. В марте 2019 года Манафорт был приговорен почти к 4 годам тюрьмы за мошенничество, а впоследствии — еще к 3,5 годам за отмывание денег, препятствование правосудию и несообщение о лоббистской работе. В том же году международная журналистская организация OCCRP установила, что Янукович и Манафорт принимали участие в отмывании средств через Swedbank. Янукович вывел с помощью банка минимум 3,6 млн долларов. ## Liberty Reserve Основанная в США компания Liberty Reserve была аналогом платежной системы PayPal, но для тех, у кого нет счета в банке. В рекламе компания называла себя «самой большой системой платежей и денежных переводов». Впоследствии федеральные прокуроры назвали Liberty Reserve одной из самых крупных в истории «прачечных» для отмывания денег. Согласно судебным документам, компания отмыла в общей сложности около 8 млрд долларов. Принцип работы Liberty Reserve был такой: 1. Для создания учетной записи не требуется никакой информации, кроме адреса электронной почты. 2. Чтобы положить деньги на счет, нужно купить местную валюту через обменник в интернете. 3. За перевод денег со счета в Liberty Reserve на счет в другой системе компания получает 1% от суммы транзакции. За дополнительные 75 центов можно было купить анонимный перевод — сервис открыл номер кошелька, из которого поступал перевод. Анонимность платежей в Liberty Reserve привлекла кардеров (угонщиков данных с **[кредитных карт](https://finance.ua/cards/credit-a)**. — Ред.), продавцов нелегальных данных, организаторов финансовых пирамид и других, кто вел не совсем честный бизнес. Однако среди аккаунтов владельцев в Liberty Reserve были и добросовестные пользователи. В общей сложности в платежной системе было зарегистрировано около 5 млн аккаунтов. Основатель Liberty Reserve — бывший киевлянин Артур Будовский — в 2016 году был приговорен к 20 годам заключения. Суд признал его виновным в использовании компании для проведения огромной многонациональной операции по отмыванию денег. Прокурор Прит Бхарара назвал Liberty Reserve «банком преступного мира». Для тех, кто зарабатывает свои деньги нелегально, отмывание средств является необходимым способом избежать уголовного преследования, тратя в то же время свои нелегальные доходы. Но эта многоуровневая финансовая схема часто приводит к краху, поскольку огромные суммы денег никогда не остаются тайной надолго.

The scandal came to light in 2018 after a whistleblower revealed that Danske Bank ignored signs of potentially criminal operations moving billions of dollars to the West from 2008 to 2017, including from Russian clients. Many clients were shell companies registered in the UK. An investigation by Danish law firm Bruun&Hjejle found that Danske Bank employees may have knowingly participated in illegal activities, and the bank failed to control money laundering, did not know the owners of many accounts, and lacked automated transaction monitoring. In 2022, Danske Bank admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, acknowledging that it provided banking services to suspicious clients through its Estonian branch despite being aware of money laundering risks.', claim_type='conviction', date_published='2024-07-11', hyde_score=0.43),\n",

How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank?](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/danske-bank-case-money-laundering-scandal-1130#how-modern-tools-prevent-cases-like-danske-bank) Between 2007 and 2015, the global financial system faced one of the most significant [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/anti-money-laundering-aml-49) failures in modern history, in which Danske Bank ([Denmark](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-denmark-245)’s largest financial institution) was implicated in a [money laundering](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/money-laundering-122) scandal amounting to over $230 billion in suspicious transactions. This scandal occurred around the bank’s Estonian branch. It both exposed critical compliance lapses and reshaped how financial institutions and regulators approach AML globally. What Was the Danske Bank Money Laundering Scandal? -------------------------------------------------- Over an eight-year period, suspicious transactions worth over $230 billion flowed predominantly from countries that are outside the EU such as [Russia](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-russia-127), [Azerbaijan](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-azerbaijan-159), and Moldova. The regulatory and AML systems in the Baltic region were actually weak at the time and unsurprisingly, they were exploited in no time. So, how was this done? The majority of these payments were processed through [offshore](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/offshore-1165) entities with minimal scrutiny which enabled illicit actors to funnel vast sums of money through Estonia, all under the guise of legitimacy. How Did the Scandal Come to Light? ---------------------------------- A former employee of Danske Bank’s Estonian branch, Howard Wilkinson acted as an in-formant and revealed systemic issues within the bank’s operations. The most striking insight about the issues was the flagging inadequacies in the handling of non-resident client accounts in 2017. The actual scope of the violations came to light after subsequent investigations by Danish and [Estonian](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-estonia-95) regulators. This was followed by the resignation of the bank’s CEO and involvement of multiple jurisdictions, including the [United States](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-united-states-of-america-80) and the United Kingdom, who proceeded to launch formal probes to determine the extent of the misconduct and who was accountable. The revelations unsurprisingly resulted in a sharp decline in Danske Bank. The bank was left with a sharp decline in the reputation, financial penalties and si-gnificant market value losses. [![Image 16: Know your customer is an important companent of anti-money laundering process](https://www.sanctionscanner.com//assets/images/Blog/what-are-the-kyc-and-aml-checks.png)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-aml-kyc-611) Timeline of Key Events ---------------------- Over a period spanning eight years between 2007 and 2015 where the transactions processed totaling $230 billion can be referred as the starting point of the incident. It is followed by the whistleblower report triggering investigations in 2017, the resignation of CEO and the investigations expanding to international scope in 2018 and finally Estonian branch inevitably shutting down operations in 2019. Today, legal proceedings and ensuing penalties still continue. Key Compliance Failures Behind the Scandal ------------------------------------------ So far, we have only briefly touched upon the compliance failures behind this scandal. Since, it is serves as a notable example of how multiple compliance failures may lead up to an International crisis, it would be wise to elaborate the failures behind this scandal. [**Know Your Customer (KYC)**](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/know-your-customer-kyc-46#:~:text=Sanction%20Scanner%20is%20an%20AML,can%20easily%20perform%20KYC%20checks.): First of all, poor Know Your Customer (KYC) certainly didn’t help the Estonian branch. A significant number of non-resident client accounts were accepted and the weak KYC processes, as well as risk assessment failures, created a gateway for illicit activities to occur unchecked. **[Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/what-is-sar-report-149))**: Just like the KYC procedures, ineffective Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) were inadequate as well, both in quantity and timeliness. **Transaction Monitoring Systems**: Another shortcoming was the weak transaction monitoring systems of the bank which resulted in the vast sums of money, which can always be potentially linked to money laundering or other criminal activities, to flow through the system undetected. In addition to these compliance faults, the disconnection between the Copenhagen head office and the Estonian branch certainly didn’t help avoiding a situation like this. The head office couldn’t provide sufficient oversight, auditing and accountability measure, which resulted in local compliance lapses and unaddressed potential misconduct for extended periods of time. ![Image 17](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/Key%20Compliance%20Failures%20Behind%20the%20Scandal.webp) Consequences for Danske Bank ---------------------------- Danske Bank went through several immediate and long-lasting repercussions. It goes without saying that the Estonian branch was forced to shut down operations, thus leaving a significant gap in the regional network. Unfortunately, the damage wasn’t only done to the Estonian branch. Danske Bank’s market value plummeted and key executives were compel-led to resign. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice, European authorities and various financial institutions led several investigations and the bank faced further regulatory fines and legal liabilities but on the bright side, the scandal served as a catalyst for broader AML reforms within the European Union. Why This Case Was a Turning Point for AML in Europe? ---------------------------------------------------- It’s because this scandal acted as a wake-up call for the European Commission and the commission subsequently proceeded to propose the creation of a centralized [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/top-11-aml-tools-for-2025-features-prices-use-cases-1020) regulatory body called AMLA. In addition to the AMLA, financial transaction monitoring systems have shifted to empha-size real-time oversight to enable authorities to quickly detect and mitigate risks associated with transnational money laundering by leveraging advanced technology, such as AI-driven analytics. Financial institutions are now mandated to adopt more detailed and stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols that must include additional verification steps for non-resident and high-risk clients, such as detailed background checks, ongoing monitoring of transac-tional behavior, and enhanced scrutiny for [politically exposed persons (PEPs)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/politically-exposed-person-pep-56). Another thing that set off the alarm bells was that it demonstrated how urgent it was for financial institutions to adopt a more proactive compliance culture. So, the banks and other entities implemented risk-based strategies tailored to their specific operational environments. Obviously, it depends on the needs of the business but primary examples would be regular staff training, the establishment of clear internal reporting channels, and the use of advanced tools to identify and mitigate risks related to illicit activities. [![Image 18](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/AML-Software-Sanction-Scanner.webp)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/request-demo) How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank? ------------------------------------------------ Preventing another scandal of this magnitude requires adopting cutting-edge technological solutions tailored for AML compliance. Luckily, there are tools like Sanction Scanner, which are fine examples of how technology can be used to empower financial institutions to detect and mitigate financial crime risks. Let’s come to the what these technologies can deliver. Real-Time Name Screening, Automated Transaction Monitoring and Comprehensive Risk Assessments serve as good examples that incorporate competent algorithms and AI models. FAQ's Blog Post --------------- What is the Danske Bank money laundering scandal? What is the Danske Bank money laundering scandal? How much money was laundered through Danske Bank? Investigations revealed that approximately €200 billion in potentially suspicious funds were moved through non-resident accounts in Danske Bank's Estonian branch over eight years. Who was involved in the Danske Bank scandal? The scandal involved Danske Bank employees, Estonian regulators, foreign shell companies, and clients from Russia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and other high-risk jurisdictions. Several top executives, including the former CEO Thomas Borgen, resigned or faced charges. What was the role of Estonia in the Danske Bank scandal? Danske Bank’s Estonian branch was the central point for processing suspicious cross-border transactions. Estonia's relatively lax AML enforcement at the time enabled these transactions to go undetected for years. What were the consequences for Danske Bank? Danske Bank faced multiple investigations by EU and US authorities. It was forced to shut down operations in Estonia, paid hundreds of millions in fines, and saw a massive reputational decline, including criminal charges filed in Denmark and other jurisdictions. Why is the Danske Bank case significant for AML compliance? The case exposed systemic failures in AML controls, due diligence, and cross-border supervision, prompting regulators worldwide to tighten oversight, especially regarding non-resident accounts and correspondent banking. Has Danske Bank been penalized by the U.S.? Yes. In December 2022, Danske Bank agreed to forfeit $2 billion as part of a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC for defrauding U.S. banks and violating AML laws.

В соответствии с заключённым с Минюстом США соглашением за содействие и существенный вклад Эстонии в проведение расследования в отношении Danske Bank Estonia американскими властями стране будет возвращена сумма в размере 50 млн долларов США (более 4,2 млрд рублей в эквиваленте) для целей совершенствования национальной системы противодействия финансовым преступлениям (особенно ОД/ФТ, мошенничеству и киберпреступности), развития программ обучения специалистов в противолегализационной сфере, а также криминалистической экспертизы цифровых данных и проведения кампаний по повышению осведомлённости населения о финансовых преступлениях.

О совместном докладе ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в Италии 7 января 2025 года опубликован доклад о результатах совместного исследования ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в стране4. В докладе отмечается, что задача по определению точного размера ОД в стране заведомо представляется труднодостижимой и крайне проблематичной в связи со скрытым характером незаконных финансовых потоков, а также наличием ряда ограничений, связанных с доступными данными и недостатками в применяемых до настоящего времени методологиях оценки. В рамках указанного исследования в целях получения наиболее точной оценки ОД в стране итальянским ПФР и Банком Италии использовалась усовершенствованная методология, предусматривающая процедуру тщательного отбора СПО для анализа содержащихся в них данных, применение специализированного алгоритма машинного обучения для выявления надёжной информации из массива доступных данных и использование метода статистической подборки для вычисления 3 В период 2008-2016 гг. Danske Bank в целях получения максимально возможной прибыли умышленно нарушал требования американского противолегализационного законодательства, содействовал ОД через американскую финансовую систему и в конечном итоге стал представлять собой существенную угрозу для её стабильности. Danske Bank признал ответственность за введение в заблуждение американских банков и проведение через американскую финансовую систему подозрительных операций для высокорисковых клиентов на суммы, исчисляемые в миллиардах долларов США. В 2022 г. по результатам проведённого американскими властями расследования Danske Bank был оштрафован на более чем 2 млрд долларов США (более 204,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). 4 The size of money laundering and other illicit financial conduct for Italy.

По результатам анализа объёмы ОД в период с 2018 по 2022 гг. в Италии варьировали от 25 до 35 млрд евро, что в среднем составило около 1,8 % от ВВП страны за указанный период.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже BitMEX 15 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о применении к международной криптовалютной бирже BitMEX5 штрафных санкций в связи с выявленными нарушениями требований Закона США о банковской тайне (BSA/AML)6. По результатам проверки Прокуратуры Южного округа штата Нью-Йорк установлено, что криптовалютной биржей умышленно нарушались требования BSA/AML при оказании услуг американским клиентам. В частности, биржей не была разработана, внедрена и не применялась эффективная программа по ПОД/ФТ. При этом в компании сознательно, c одобрения руководства компании, применялись минимальные требования по идентификации клиентов при принятии их на обслуживание (у клиентов запрашивалась только информация об адресе электронной почты). Топ-менеджмент компании был осведомлён о том, что проживающие на территории США клиенты как минимум с 2018 года пользовались для проведения операций торговой платформой BitMEX. При этом механизмы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ компании были абсолютно неэффективны и позволили BitMEX провести через американскую финансовую систему миллионы долларов США. За умышленное нарушений требований BSA/AML BitMEX выплатит штраф в размере 100 млн долларов США (около 8,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, для биржи установлен двухлетний срок, в течение которого ей предписано устранить выявленные недостатки в части выполнения требований BSA/AML.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже KuCoin 27 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз о применении Министерством юстиции США штрафных санкций к компании-оператору одной из крупнейших криптовалютных бирж KuCoin7 – Peken Global Limited (Peken) – за нарушение требований законодательства в сфере ПОД/ФТ. 5 Криптовалютная биржа BitMEX – одна из крупнейших в мире торговых платформ криптовалютных деривативов на базе биткоин; принадлежит компании HDR Global Trading Limited, зарегистрированной в Республике Сейшелы; в настоящее время является лидером по объёму торгов (свыше 300 тыс. биткоинов в сутки, что составляет более 2,5 млрд долларов в эквиваленте). 6 Закон США о банковской тайне (Bank Secrecy Act, BSA) известен также как Закон о предоставлении отчётности о валютных и трансграничных операциях (Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act) и Закон о противодействии отмыванию доходов, полученных преступным путём (Anti-Money Laundering Law). 7 KuCoin KuCoin зарегистрирована в Республике Сейшелы в 2017 г.; занимает 6-е место среди криптовалютных бирж по объёму торгов. По состоянию на 28.01.2025 суточный объём торгов на KuCoin составляет 1,9 млрд долларов США.

KuCoin осуществляла в США нелицензированную деятельность в качестве оператора по переводу денежных средств. Кроме того, в период с 2017 г. по март 2024 г. криптовалютной биржей не выполнялись требования противолегализационного законодательства, связанные с применением мер НПК, информированием ПФР о подозрительных операциях, в результате чего через биржу были проведены подозрительные операции (со средствами, полученными в результате незаконной торговли на площадках даркнет, использования вредоносного программного обеспечения, программ-вымогателей и мошеннических схем) на миллиарды долларов США. Даже после внедрения процедур НПК биржа не смогла обеспечить должным образом идентификацию уже существующих клиентов. Сумма штрафа для компании составила более 297,4 млн долларов США (более 25,1 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Источник информации: официальный сайт Министерства юстиции США в сети Интернет. Об отчёте Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 г. 28 января 2025 года опубликован отчёт Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin) о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 год. К основным рискам, угрожающим стабильности финансового сектора Германии (наряду с рисками, связанными с уязвимостями сектора недвижимости; рисками невозврата кредитов юридическими лицами; рисками кибербезопасности; рисками, связанными с изменениями на финансовом рынке; рисками рыночной концентрации в результате IT аутсорсинга), отнесены риски, связанные с ненадлежащим применением мер в сфере ПОД/ФТ. Приоритетность задач по снижению рисков ОД/ФТ в финансовом секторе Германии продолжает сохраняться на высоком уровне (с учётом того, что 96% всех СПО, поступивших в немецкое ПФР в 2023 г., были направлены представителями финансового сектора). Также BaFin зафиксирован рост рисков, связанных с использованием неофициальных систем по переводу/перемещению денежных средств и ценностей (например, хавала), новых технологий, виртуальных международных номеров банковского счёта (IBAN), криптоактивов.

Банком (i) не осуществлялся должным образом мониторинг подозрительных операций клиентов (в связи с неэффективностью системы мониторинга операций); (ii) не применялись меры по выявлению и снижению рисков совершения финансовых преступлений в установленные законодательством сроки; (iii) допускались существенные задержки при обработке оповещений системы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ о рисках ОД/ФТ и потенциально незаконной финансовой деятельности. Совокупная сумма штрафа для банка составила 20 млн евро (более 1,8 млрд рублей в эквиваленте), из них 5 млн евро – за нарушения противолегализационного законодательства.

О руководстве Европола по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями 30 января 2025 года Полицейской службой Европейского союза (Европола) опубликовано руководство по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями в целях противодействия ОД/ФТ и другим финансовым преступлениям10. В руководстве отмечается важная роль государственно-частных партнёрств и иных аналогичных механизмов в обеспечении эффективного взаимодействия между финансовыми организациями, ПФР и следственными органами при проведении расследований преступлений, в частности ОД, в части обмена персональными данными и/или конфиденциальной информацией, связанной с уголовными расследованиями. После вступления в силу нового европейского противолегализационного законодательства стала очевидна ценность такого взаимодействия, которое позволило обмениваться не только данными о типологиях преступлений, но и специфическими данными по конкретным уголовным делам, что способствует повышению эффективности расследований и возврата преступных активов. В настоящее время государственно-частные партнёрства, обеспечивающие обмен информацией по вопросам ПОД, в той или иной форме существуют во всех странах Европы. Однако, механизмы, которые позволяют обмениваться персональными данными, относящимися к конфиденциальным расследованиям правоохранительных органов, существуют11 только в Великобритании, Дании, Ирландии, Латвии, Нидерландах и Швеции. В состав таких механизмов взаимодействия обычно входят: ПФР, полицейские ведомства, прокуратура, налоговые и надзорные органы; значимые (на национальном уровне или с операционной точки зрения) финансовые организации, 9 Пруденциальный надзор за деятельностью De Volksbank (с учётом его значимости для финансового рынка) осуществляет непосредственно ЕЦБ. 10 EFIPPP Practical Guide for Operational Cooperation between Investigative Authorities and Financial Institutions. 11 На момент публикации руководства.

Сотрудничество между компетентными органами и финансовыми организациями может осуществляться в следующих целях: - разработки новых направлений расследования; - обеспечения сбора доказательной базы по текущим расследованиям; - пресечения угроз финансовых преступлений посредством применения превентивных мер; - расширения возможностей финансовых организаций по защите от финансовых преступлений. Отмечается, что следственные органы, как правило, недооценивают тот факт, что финансовые организации играют ключевую роль в качестве «гейткиперов»12 в системе ПОД/ФТ при выявлении незаконных финансовых потоков и обладают всесторонними компетенциями и эффективными цифровыми решениями, обеспечивающими выявление преступной деятельности. Вместе с тем для того, чтобы наиболее эффективно использовать потенциал частного сектора в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями, представляется возможным изменить характер взаимодействия между компетентными ведомствами и частным сектором, которое в настоящее время в большей степени основано на исполнении частным сектором указаний со стороны государственных органов, и переориентировать его на коллективное системное реагирование на угрозы финансовых преступлений. Это в конечном итоге будет способствовать повышению эффективности уголовных расследований и укреплению потенциала частного сектора в части выявления и предотвращения финансовых преступлений.

Предлагаемый законопроектом механизм изъятия денежных средств во внесудебном порядке «не соответствует Конституции РФ и гражданскому законодательству», говорится в отзыве Счетной палаты. «Согласно статье 35 Конституции РФ никто не может быть лишен своего имущества иначе как по решению суда», - напоминает СП. При этом проект допускает возможность судебного обжалования решение об отнесении клиента к «красной зоне» только после обращения в межведомственную комиссию. Счетная палата предлагает рассмотреть возможность решения таких споров как в административном, так и в судебном порядке, что «в большей степени соответствует конституционным принципам права на защиту», говорится в отзыве.

Кроме того, Центробанк теперь не считает сомнительной операцию, когда клиент осуществляет транзакцию через представителя, не вступающего с банком в личный контакт. ### 2020 #### Сокращение объема незаконного обналичивания на 32 млрд рублей Объем незаконного обналичивания средств в российских [банках](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8,_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82 \"Финансовые услуги, инвестиции и аудит\") по итогам 2020 года сократился на 32 млрд [рублей](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8C \"Российский рубль\") — до 78 млрд рублей с 110 млрд рублей в 2019-м. Об этом сообщил заместитель председателя правления [ЦБ РФ](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%91_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ЦБ РФ\") [Дмитрий Скобелкин](/index.php/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0:%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 \"Скобелкин Дмитрий Германович\"). Он назвал этот спад «неплохим показателем», учитывая, что в условиях пандемии коронавируса [[COVID-19] вопрос незаконного обналичивания средств «стоял и стоит достаточно остро». Замглавы Банка [России](/index.php/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Россия\") обратил внимание, что в 2020 году россияне активно снимали наличные деньги, чем пользовались и обнальщики. Однако, как подчеркнул Скобелкин, [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") в целом справились с ситуацией. Объем незаконного обналичивания в 2020 году сократился на 32 млрд рублей По словам Скобелкина, объем сомнительных транзитных операций в банках в 2020 году снизился до 600 млрд рублей со 720 млрд рублей годом ранее. Незаконный вывод денег за рубеж через российские кредитные организации уменьшился на 21,2% — до 52 млрд рублей с 66 млрд рублей. Согласно статистике, которую привел зампред Центробанка, правоохранительные органы возбудили более 20 крупных уголовных дел на основании сообщений, которые банки отправляли в финансовую разведку. Как сообщили в ЦБ РФ, в 2020 году в России зарегистрировано несколько новых схем обналичивания средств. Так, мошенники стали активно использовать схемы с исполнительными листами и с депозитными счетами нотариусов. По данным регулятора, на них пришлось более 40% операций по обналичиванию через счета физлиц. В случае со схемой с исполнительными документами иностранная компания-пустышка взыскивает через суд фиктивный долг с российской фирмы (иногда с заблокированным за сомнительные операции счетом) и тем самым добивается «чистоты» происхождения средств - деньги переводятся не напрямую из компании в компанию, а через службу судебных приставов. В модификации этой схемы, которую стали использовать обнальщики, одной из сторон выступает физлицо. Банки при этом не имеют права препятствовать исполнению решений суда.[[5]](#cite_note-4) #### Принят закон, уточняющий схему работы банков с клиентами в рамках \"антиотмывочных\" норм [Госдума РФ](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"Госдума РФ\") в декабре 2020 года приняла закон, который уточняет схему работы банков с клиентами при наличии подозрений, связанных с действием \"антиотмывочного\" законодательства (ФЗ-115). Документ (N948530-7) был внесен в парламент правительством в конце апреля. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | | Как пояснял ранее замминистра финансов Алексей Моисеев, поправки исключают возможность злоупотребления со стороны банков при использовании и отказе в открытии счетов со ссылкой на 115 федеральный закон. \"В частности, предусматривается, что непредставление в кредитную организацию документа, который предназначен для фиксации информации в соответствии с положениями данного закона, не будет являться основанием для принятия решения об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, либо отказе в выполнении распоряжении клиента о совершении операции с денежными средствами или имуществом\", — сказал замминистра. | | Предусматривается информирование клиента об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, предоставление причины такого отказа, также устанавливается срок для информирования о принятии данного решения: 5 дней. Решение об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета или о его расторжении принимается руководителем кредитной организации или специально уполномоченными им лицами. Сокращается с 10 до 7 дней срок, в течение которого организация обязана сообщить клиенту об устранении оснований, в соответствии с которыми ранее было принято решение об отказе от проведения операции или об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета. #### Власти Чехии арестовали $13 млн, поступившие от российского ИТ-дистрибутора Как стало известно TAdviser, власти [Чехии](/index.php/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Чехия\") по подозрению в отмывании арестовали $13,3 млн, поступившие местной компании Bardet от российского импортера ИТ-оборудования «Техтраст».

О новом проекте «[Известиям](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F%D0%BC \"Известиям\")» рассказали в [БКС Банке](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F:%D0%91%D0%9A%D0%A1_-_%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA \"БКС - Инвестиционный Банк\"). Предполагается, что в сервисе будет предусмотрен личный кабинет: после прохождения авторизации клиент сможет увидеть, есть ли в его адрес официально зафиксированные сведения по «антиотмывочному» закону со стороны кредитных организаций и какой именно банк выступает их источником. В России создают разрабатывают платформу для проверки «антиотмывочной» истории банковских клиентов В БКС Банке отметили, что кредитные организации заинтересованы в сокращении пути реабилитации и упрощении коммуникации с кредитными организациями и регулятором для добросовестных клиентов.

Это на 6% больше по сравнению с 2022-м, когда затраты оценивались в $13,52 млрд. Обзор отрасли приводится в материалах Market Research Future, обнародованных в начале сентября 2024 года. Авторы исследования выделяют несколько ключевых факторов, способствующих росту спроса на цифровые решения для борьбы с отмыванием денег.

[ИИ](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\")-алгоритмы способны анализировать огромные массивы данных, выявлять подозрительные закономерности и автоматизировать рутинные процессы. Развитие отрасли также стимулируется благодаря развертыванию облачных решений, обеспечивающих многочисленные преимущества, такие как масштабируемость, более низкая стоимость, гибкое управление рисками, уменьшенное время развертывания и оперативное обновление.

Об этом сообщается в отчете финансовой организации [SWIFT](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:SWIFT \"SWIFT\"), опубликованном в начале сентября 2020 года[[10]](#cite_note-9)[[11]](#cite_note-10). Согласно отчету, случаи отмывания [хакерами](/index.php/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8 \"Хакерами\") похищенных денег через [криптовалюту](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") встречаются очень редко. Количество выявленных случаев отмывания средств через криптовалюту остается сравнительно небольшим по сравнению с суммами, отмываемыми традиционными способами – с помощью «денежных мулов», подставных компаний и инвестиций в другие виды преступной деятельности (наркоторговлю, торговлю людьми и пр.). В качестве примера использования [криптовалюты](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") для отмывания денег в отчете SWIFT приведено дело об одной из киберпреступных группировок, занимающихся атаками на банкоматы. Хотя популярным способом отмывания похищенных средств у таких группировок является покупка и перепродажа дорогостоящих товаров, киберпреступники конвертировали похищенную из банкоматов «наличку» в криптовалюту. Еще одним примером является восточноевропейская группировка, запустившая собственную криптоферму в Восточной [Азии](/index.php/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Азия\"). Киберпреступники использовали похищенные у банков средства для финансирования работы криптофермы и генерирования [биткойнов](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Биткойнов\"), которые затем тратились в странах Восточной [Европы](/index.php/%D0%95%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0 \"Европа\"). После ареста участников группировки сотрудники правоохранительных органов обнаружили в доме у их лидера 15 тыс. биткойнов стоимостью $109 млн и ювелирные украшения на общую сумму в $557 тыс., а также два спортивных автомобиля. Криптовалютой для отмывания похищенных средств также пользуется киберпреступная группировка Lazarus, предположительно работающая на северокорейское правительство. Согласно отчету SWIFT, киберпреступники похищают деньги у банков, конвертируют в криптовалюту через множество бирж с целью скрыть их происхождение, а затем снова переводят в реальные деньги и отправляют на счета в [КНДР](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%9D%D0%94%D0%A0 \"КНДР\"). В редких случаях злоумышленники покупают на похищенные у банков средства предоплаченные криптовалютные карты – физические дебетовые карты, на которых вместо реальных денег можно держать криптовалюту. Снимать средства с таких карт можно через специальные банкоматы, кроме того, их можно использовать для оплаты товаров и услуг. Однако, как подчеркивают эксперты, представленные выше примеры – это, скорее, исключение, чем правило. Такие случаи встречаются очень редко по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денег. Тем не менее, по мнению специалистов, в будущем число подобных случаев будет расти. #### Американские адвокаты будут расследовать масштабные случаи отмывания денег в Эстонии [Эстония](/index.php/%D0%AD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Эстония\") заключила договор с действующим в США адвокатским бюро Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP об оказании правовых услуг эстонскому государству по вопросам, связанным с фактами международного отмывания денег[[12]](#cite_note-11).

Sa succursale estonienne disposait d’un portefeuille de clients internationaux qui recouraient fréquemment à des sociétés écrans, leur permettant de contourner la réglementation fiscale. La banque danoise a fait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment en lien avec une société française dont la gérante a été condamnée en procédure de comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité en janvier 2024. Le 18 septembre 2024, la convention judiciaire d’intérêt publique (“CJIP”) conclue entre le procureur de la République financier et la société Danske Bank A/S a été validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris[1]. Cette dernière faisait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment de fraude fiscale commis en bande organisée, affaire dans laquelle la gérante personne physique d’une société d’import-export, a été condamnée pour blanchiment de [fraude fiscale](https://navacelle.law/fr/expertise/droit-penal-fiscal/) par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris, le 9 janvier 2024[2]. ##### En février 2014, le parquet de Paris a été destinataire d’une plainte pour recel d’escroquerie et blanchiment, du fonds d’investissement Hermitage Capital[3]. En juin 2014, TRACFIN a transféré[4] une note au parquet de Paris, faisant état d’une activité suspecte sur les comptes bancaires de la société française d’import-export Decobat. En effet, au titre de sa mission de service de renseignement, TRACFIN dispose de moyens d’investigation divers lui permettant de recueillir des éléments susceptibles de caractériser une infraction de blanchiment du produit d’une infraction punie d’une peine privative de liberté supérieure à un an ou du financement du terrorisme au sens de l’article L.561-30-1 du Code monétaire et financier[5]. ##### Le 8 juillet 2014, une enquête préliminaire portant notamment sur les activités d’importation en Russie de cette société a été ouverte[6]. Une information judiciaire a par la suite été ouverte le 9 avril 2015 des chefs de fraude fiscale en bande organisée, blanchiment et recel d’escroquerie en bande organisée pour des faits commis en France et de manière indivisible à l’étranger depuis 2008[7]. L’instruction a révélé que la succursale estonienne de la banque danoise, la Sampo Bank, détenait un portefeuille de milliers de clients résidant en dehors de l’Estonie (le “PNR”)[8], qu’elle savait à haut risque en raison des pays de résidence des clients, leur recours fréquent à des sociétés écrans susceptibles de masquer l’identité de leurs bénéficiaires effectifs, de l’expéditeur ou du destinataire des transactions et effectuaient des transactions suspectes[9]. Il apparaissait ainsi que la succursale était dotée d’un dispositif de conformité insuffisant concernant le PNR[10], étant donné qu’il permettait aux clients d’ouvrir des comptes et d’enregistrer des transactions sans contrôle ou diligence raisonnable[11]. L’enquête a ainsi révélé que la gérante de Decobat avait pu ouvrir deux comptes auprès de la Sampo Bank, au nom de deux sociétés écrans, utilisés comme comptes de transit pour contourner les règles fiscales et douanières[12]. En effet, la société Decobat exportait ses marchandises vers la Russie en les vendant à une société de droit russe mais en réalisant via des _brokers_ des déclarations douanières à l’import dans les pays baltes _,_ qui étaient minorées revoyant à la baisse l’évaluation des droits de douanes et de la TVA. La société russe transférait ensuite ses bénéfices au Luxembourg vers des comptes ouverts dans les Îles Vierges britanniques et au Luxembourg par le biais de ses comptes ouverts à la Sampo Bank[13]. Les audits de Danske Bank effectués jusqu’en 2014, ainsi que d’autres procédures de contrôle interne, ont systématiquement conclu à un contrôle des clients jugé satisfaisant, révélant une attitude passive et complaisante de l’entreprise, malgré les alertes de la Financial Supervisory Authority (“FSA”) danoise[14]. L’inefficacité de ces mécanismes a permis à la dirigeante de Decobat, résidente fiscale française, de transférer plus de 3 millions d’euros depuis ses deux autres sociétés vers des comptes au Luxembourg, au nom de sociétés offshore dont elle était la bénéficiaire effective[15]. ##### La Danske Bank A/S était alors été mise en examen pour des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, commis entre 2007 et 2014, aggravés par la circonstance qu’ils étaient perpétrés en bande organisée, utilisant plusieurs intermédiaires dont les opérations visaient uniquement à dissimuler la destination des fonds détournés et à en faire profiter des bénéficiaires à l’étranger[16]. Ces pratiques ont notamment conduit à la condamnation de la banque danoise en 2022, d’abord par les autorités danoises pour manquement aux obligations de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement des activités terroristes, puis par les autorités américaines pour conspiration en vue de commettre une fraude bancaire[17]. En France, la banque danoise a reconnu les faits reprochés, incriminés aux articles 324-1, 324-2, 324-3, 324-4, 324-7, 324-8 et 324-9 du Code pénal[18], lui permettant de bénéficier de la CJIP, alternative aux poursuites dont l’avantage est notamment de limiter l’amende d’intérêt public[19]. Aux termes de la [CJIP négociée](https://www.justice.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2024-09/CJIP_DANSKE_BANK_AS_20240827.pdf) avec le parquet national financier (“PNF”), elle a accepté de payer de la somme de 6 028 799€ au titre de l’amende d’intérêt public[20], après analyse des facteurs majorants, tel que le caractère répété des faits ou l’insuffisance du programme de conformité[21] et minorants, à l’instar des mesures correctives mises en place au sein de la Danske Bank ou encore de sa coopération dans l’enquête[22]. Elle a également consenti à verser 300 000 euros pour indemniser l’État français, dont 10 000 euros pour le préjudice matériel et 290 000 euros pour le préjudice moral[23]. Cette approche se distingue de celle de la Cour de cassation qui a retenu à plusieurs reprises que le délit de blanchiment de fraude fiscale ne cause à l’État aucun préjudice moral susceptible d’être réparé dès lors que le préjudice “_découlant des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, caractérisé par le discrédit jeté sur les politiques de lutte contre le blanchiment_” n’est pas distinct du préjudice causé à l’intérêt général réparé par l’action du ministère public[24]. Sauf à démontrer l’existence d’un préjudice moral autre que celui lié au discrédit, cette CJIP a permis à l’État de bénéficier de la réparation d’un préjudice dont l’existence n’aurait potentiellement pas été reconnue dans le cadre d’un procès devant un Tribunal correctionnel.

The case involved Danske Bank's Estonian branch, which maintained a portfolio of high-risk international clients who frequently used shell companies to evade tax regulations. The bank was investigated for facilitating money laundering activities linked to a French import-export company, whose manager was convicted in January 2024. The investigation revealed that Danske Bank's compliance controls were inadequate, allowing clients to open accounts and conduct transactions without proper due diligence. The CJIP, validated by the Paris Judicial Court on September 18, 2024, required Danske Bank to pay a public interest fine of €6,028,799 and an additional €300,000 in compensation to the French state. The settlement took into account aggravating factors such as repeated offenses and compliance program deficiencies, as well as mitigating factors like corrective measures and cooperation with authorities. Danske Bank also faced previous penalties in Denmark and the US for related AML failures and fraud.

Судя по внутренней переписке, в компании это было поводом для шуток. #### Автор: 12 ноября 2024 г. Март 2013 года. Алексей Аверсон, клиент-менеджер в эстонском Swedbank, только что завершил встречу с потенциальными корпоративными клиентами и получил шутливое сообщение от коллеги: «Как дела на отмывочном рынке?» «Ко мне вчера приходили товарищи отмыватели с золотыми часами. Предлагали сотрудничать», — ответил Аверсон. Он добавил, что Роберт Китт, тогдашний глава отдела по работе с корпоративными клиентами и будущий гендиректор компании, в курсе событий: «Китт почти согласился, а я нет». «Китт согласился? — удивился коллега. Серьезно? Он не осознает риски?» «Его не интересует борьба с отмыванием денег, его интересует бизнес. Он один из нас, пусть будет председателем комитета :)», — отшутился Аверсон. Судя по всему, он говорил о группе банковских менеджеров и руководителей, ответственных за общение с ценными корпоративными клиентами (Китт не ответил на обвинения в сокрытии отмывания денег в банке, Аверсон отказался от подробных комментариев). Это так называемые HRNR-клиенты: высокорисковые компании-нерезиденты, многие из которых ([как позже выявило расследование](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/swedbanks-high-risk-secrets)) контролировали российские олигархи. Они обращались в эстонский Swedbank за помощью с регистрацией и управлением счетами для сложных офшорных сетей, через которые выводили миллионы долларов из России. HRNR-клиенты посодействовали успеху банка: как [сообщали СМИ](https://www.svt.se/special/swedbank/rapporten/) со ссылкой на внутренние документы Swedbank, с 2008 по 2018 год на их долю пришлось более 100 миллиардов евро от общего оборота. Благодаря этому Swedbank стал вторым по величине банком в Эстонии. Все поменялось в 2019 году, когда журналисты шведского телеканала SVT раскрыли, что Swedbank и [Danske Bank](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat/the-contract-factory-inside-danske-bank-estonias-money-laundering-machine) использовали для перемещения средств (суммарно почти шесть миллиардов долларов) через подозрительные счета в странах Балтии. Расследование OCCRP и «Важных историй» показало, что Swedbank помог одному из самых прибыльных клиентов, российскому олигарху и экс-министру Михаилу Абызову, вывести сотни миллионов долларов на офшорные счета на Кипре, Британских Виргинских Островах, в Сингапуре и Белизе. Из них 53 миллиона долларов, как позже установил российский суд, Абызов похитил из двух сибирских энергетических компаний. (С Абызовым не удалось связаться для получения комментариев, поскольку он находится в тюрьме. Когда OCCRP впервые сообщил о его счетах в Swedbank, его адвокат отказался комментировать результаты расследования.) Новости о том, что Swedbank организовал масштабную отмывочную схему для крупных корпоративных клиентов, стали основанием для международного расследования. Шведское разбирательство завершилось лишь в этом году: в сентябре бывшую руководительницу Swedbank Биргитте Боннесен [приговорили](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/swedish-court-sends-ex-ceo-of-swedbank-to-prison) к 15 месяцам тюрьмы. Суд постановил, что Боннесен, которая с 2016 по 2019 год занимала в банке должность гендиректора, а перед этим три года возглавляла отдел по работе с клиентами из стран Балтии, обманывала общественность и акционеров насчет рисков отмывания денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Власти Эстонии надеялись на аналогичный исход, открыв дело в отношении ряда топ-менеджеров, руководителей и сотрудников банка. Однако процесс застопорился, когда выяснилось, что необходимо сотрудничество России. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли, поставив под сомнение способность мировых судов преследовать коррупционеров в случаях, когда требуется содействие России или других авторитарных режимов. Журналисты не могли получить судебные документы, пока дело было открыто. Теперь же в распоряжении Delfi Estonia, партнера OCCRP, оказались следственные документы, согласно которым сотрудники банка систематически нарушали протоколы в сфере обеспечения прозрачности, чтобы помочь российским олигархам, входившим в число главных клиентов, сохранить анонимность. 300 файлов, которые эстонская прокуратура предоставила после запроса на основании Закона о свободе информации, включают отредактированные полицейские записи и внутренние документы из эстонского отделения Swedbank, в том числе письма, переписку и служебные записки. Судя по сообщениям, менеджеры по работе с клиентами вроде Аверсона (зачастую они первыми встречали новых клиентов, и их карьера зависела от удовлетворения клиентских потребностей) открыто обсуждали отмывание денег и даже шутили об этом. «Я бы не открыл ему счет, но чувак принес бутылку Hennessy X.O., — написал Аверсон коллеге в августе 2014 года. — Тогда я решил: “фиг с ним, хоть есть за что”». «Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио, — похвастался другой менеджер о клиенте. — Много отмывают, ничего не боятся». Еще один сотрудник банка написал, что его бывший коллега «по уши погряз в отмывании». Что ж, [наш коллега] В хорошо поработал [с клиентом]. Теперь отправим туда независимую делегацию. В идеале хотелось бы посмотреть без его комментариев, насколько там все прозрачно. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Не пугай там [у клиента] слишком сильно [менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. А то В заверяет, что все прекрасно, а потом появляетесь вы и наводите шухер.)) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ты же там с ним уже был, да? Все же выглядело чисто и прозрачно? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Мне нравится, как звучит «чистое и прозрачное отмывание денег».))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ну на месте разберемся — ни у меня, ни у M\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* нет достойных часов… К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Хехехехе :9))))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Тормози, не так прямо. Все равно все тщательно проверим с Алексеем [Аверсоном]. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Понял. И вам часы нужны. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Я не привередливый) Деньги тоже норм. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Окей. Деньги ликвиднее часов. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. А [клиент] вообще еще активен? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио. Много отмывают, ничего не боятся. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Главное, что ничего не скрывают.)))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Точно, скоро будут платежи подписывать: «отмытые деньги, взятка, грязные деньги». К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. В эстонских следственных документах есть транскрипты коммуникаций между сотрудниками Swedbank. Тут менеджеры по работе с клиентами обсуждают планы банка отправить делегацию к HRNR-клиенту, чтобы проверить его деятельность на «чистоту». Их смешит концепция «прозрачного отмывания денег». Чат переведен (оригинал на смеси русского, эстонского и английского языков), некоторые части сокращены для ясности. Имена клиентов и менеджеров, которые не были подозреваемыми в ходе расследования, скрыты. В эстонском филиале Swedbank отказались комментировать письма и другие материалы, которые получили журналисты, но сказали, что расследование закрыли «за неимением преступления». Они отметили, что на сайте юридической фирмы Clifford Chance, которую в 2019 году банк нанял для расследования возможного отмывания денег, опубликован отчет. Представители Аверсона сообщили, что он сотрудничал со следствием, а теперь хочет оставить события десятилетней давности в прошлом. ## Попав в страны Балтии, Swedbank начал активно набирать клиентов-нерезидентов Swedbank вышел в страны Балтии в 1998 году, купив контрольный пакет банковской группы Hansabank. Десятилетие спустя Swedbank полностью поглотил Hansabank и жаждал развития бизнеса: менеджеры, в особенности русскоговорящие, как Аверсон, активно собирали клиентов. «Swedbank искал нерезидентов, — рассказал Аверсон следователям в сентябре 2020 года. — Нам сказали, что нужно привести сотни или даже тысячи клиентов». Аверсону достался бывший клиент Hansabank — российская компания «Кузбассразрезуголь» (КРУ). КРУ была одним из крупнейших клиентов эстонского Swedbank: капитал предприятия оценивался в сотни миллионов долларов, а его корпоративную сеть составляли почти 200 фирм. Контролировали компанию российские олигархи Андрей Бокарев и Искандер Махмудов. Однако согласно служебной записке, которой Аверсон в 2011 году сопроводил «экстренный» запрос на открытие счетов для развивающейся офшорной сети КРУ, не все фирмы были зарегистрированы на них. Банковский сотрудник объяснил, что КРУ — важный клиент, которому требовались дополнительные офшорные компании, не связанные напрямую с Бокаревым и Махмудовым, для минимизации налогов в России. В 2011 году портфолио Аверсона расширилось: КРУ продала одну из компаний Абызову — мультимиллионеру и близкому соратнику тогдашнего российского президента Дмитрия Медведева. Бизнес-группа Ru-Com Абызова участвовала во многих энергетических, строительных и сельскохозяйственных проектах. Аверсон ездил в Москву, чтобы лично подготовить бумаги для сделки. Через несколько месяцев ему сообщили, что Абызов хочет открыть множество офшорных счетов для Ru-Com. «Клиент обещает внести приличные депозиты в Swedbank», — написал Аверсон коллегам. Близость Абызова к тогдашнему президенту Медведеву делала его «политически значимым лицом» с повышенными коррупционными рисками, а значит, к нему должны были применить усиленный контроль. Однако согласно служебной записке, банковский комитет по работе с HRNR-клиентами без лишних вопросов согласился принять Ru-Com и Абызова — «главного бенефициара компаний-нерезидентов». Как сообщил Аверсон следователям, позже в Swedbank ввели некоторые ограничения касательно подбора клиентов. «Банк не работал с игорными и алкогольными бизнесами, у остальных компаний даже не спрашивали о происхождении активов», — поделился он. Вчера тоже — «Увеличьте мой лимит на 1 млн евро, нужно дать в долг «партнерам». Полный бардак. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Мои или чьи-то еще? А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Нет, нет, это клиенты [клиент-менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Хехе, это фигня. Теперь [клиент по прозвищу] Крокодил перевел 8 миллионов в Россию. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Вот это кредит. Но миллион — это мелочь. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. В разговоре между клиент-менеджером Swedbank Алексеем Аверсоном и коллегой основное внимание уделяется запросу неназванного клиента HRNR на перевод крупной суммы денег. IВ мае 2012 года Медведев, тогда премьер-министр, назначил Абызова министром по делам открытого правительства. Судя по всему, работа в правительстве не помешала бизнесу россиянина. Империя Ru-Com продолжила процветать. Согласно внутреннему документу за январь 2014 года, Swedbank открыл для Ru-Com 53 банковских счета. Хорошие новости вскоре попали в головной офис в Швеции: Китт переслал Боннесен сообщение, в котором Аверсон называет Абызова «одним из самых инновационных бизнесменов в России» и отмечает, что объем депозитов на счетах Ru-Com достиг 30 миллионов евро. ## Схемы с участием КРУ и Ru-Com привлекли внимание банковских контролеров Какое-то время КРУ и Ru-Com были крупнейшими клиентами-нерезидентами эстонского филиала Swedbank, однако к 2016 году в банке засомневались в правильности такого положения дел. Андреас Хоббелин, контролер Swedbank Group из Норвегии, начал задавать вопросы насчет КРУ и того, в какой степени аффилированные предприятия вроде Carbo One (компания по торговле углем, которой официально владели два других бизнесмена) на самом деле контролируют Махмудов и Бокарев. Махмудов тогда засветился в международных медиа в связи со схемой отмывания денег, выявленной в рамках испанской операции против российских преступников, известной как «Тройка». (Махмудов и Бокарев позже попали под санкции Минфина США [за связи с организованной преступностью](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1731).) [Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов](/processed/containers/assets/features/iskander-makhmudov.jpg/ef38d5c485ca2a8a058bda1a06fdd9fd/iskander-makhmudov.jpg) Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов К лету вопросы Хоббелина дошли до Аверсона, которого отправили на Кипр для личной встречи с одним из официальных собственников компании, гражданином Узбекистана. Аверсон позже сообщил, что его собеседник «произвел впечатление адекватного человека, очень спокойного и уверенного». Один из руководителей Swedbank, Хейки Раадик, надеялся, что благодаря неприметным владельцам Carbo One может остаться клиентом компании. При подготовке материалов о Carbo One для контролеров он пытался минимизировать связи компании с российскими олигархами. «Я бы удалил это сообщение: \"Махмудов и Бокарев имеют влияние на компанию, однако нет документальных подтверждений того, что [официальные собственники] — подставные лица\". Постарайтесь о них как можно меньше/короче упоминать», — написал он. Банкир выразил надежду на то, что этот вопрос не дойдет до банковского комитета по этике. Тем не менее в 2017 году Carbo One, Махмудов и Бокарев привлекли внимание Мари-Лийс Кург, начальницы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Кург ранее возглавляла аналогичный отдел в другом крупном эстонском банке, SEB. Swedbank нанял ее для совершенствования работы в сфере прозрачности. Однако все ее требования по соблюдению правил встречали жесткое сопротивление. «Разница в культуре комплаенс-контроля в двух банках меня поразила», — сказала она OCCRP. Обеспокоенная происходящим, Кург направила отчет о подозрительной активности в эстонское подразделение финансовой разведки (FIU) — правительственное агентство, ответственное за расследование случаев отмывания денег и других финансовых преступлений. Она указала, что Махмудов и Бокарев — «истинные бенефициары более 200 клиентов (компаний) в юрисдикциях с низким налогообложением», которых обслуживает Swedbank. «По данным неофициальных источников, клиенты замешаны в коррупционной деятельности и, вероятно, отмывании денег», — написала Кург в сопроводительном письме. В переписке с супервайзерами в Swedbank она предупредила, что дальнейшее сотрудничество с высокорисковыми клиентами вроде Carbo One поставит банк в трудное положение. Ранее в Deutsche Bank, обрабатывавшем некоторые транзакции Swedbank, сказали, что больше не будут принимать платежи «политически значимых лиц». Кург спросила, проходили ли средства Carbo One через Deutsche Bank за последние 18 месяцев. «Если да, вероятно, мы имеем дело с нарушением условий договора», — пояснила она. «Я все выходные переживала», — написала Кург. Получив отчет о подозрительной активности, FIU вызвало на допрос Кург и Свена Киввистика, тогдашнего главу отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в странах Балтии. Судя по внутренней переписке, руководители Swedbank забеспокоились. Китт назвал ситуацию «болезненной. Очень болезненной». «Мы имеем дело не с копами-новичками, — написал Киввистик, отметив, что один из следователей имел за плечами опыт более двадцати лет работы в полиции. — Его точно нельзя недооценивать». Менеджеры банка просчитывали, как Киввистику лучше общаться с FIU, чтобы минимизировать последствия показаний Кург. «Вопрос в том, как нейтрализовать активного и глупого человека, перед которым сидят опытные следователи, — написал Китт Киввистику о Кург. — Они сразу поймут по языку тела, если ты попытаешься ее оговорить». Кург говорит, что вскоре после допроса в FIU ее уволили. «Это был очень сложный период в моей карьере, — поделилась она. — Я не могла объяснить внезапное увольнение». Киввистик отказался от комментариев. ## Российский приговор Абызова помог Swedbank избежать наказания в Эстонии Судя по всему, в эстонском Swedbank поняли, что продолжать отношения с крупнейшим HRNR-клиентом — плохая идея, и в конце 2016 года прекратили сотрудничать с компаниями Ru-Com. К моменту, когда Кург направила отчет властям, та же участь постигла КРУ. Когда Swedbank дистанцировался от КРУ и Ru-Com, Аверсон — клиент-менеджер, который был ключевым звеном в работе с ними, — покинул банк и нашел нового работодателя — Абызова. Будучи директором одной из кипрских компаний россиянина, Аверсон отвечал за руководство [элитными активами](https://youtu.be/y35SmhHa4jA) Il Tesoro в Тоскане, включающими несколько вилл, теннисный корт, виноградники, оливковые рощи и вертолетную площадку. Сам Абызов в 2018 году покинул Россию, не получив второй срок в должности министра. В следующем году в ходе короткой поездки домой его арестовали и обвинили в хищении более 53 миллионов долларов из сибирских энергетических холдингов и выводе средств за границу. В декабре 2023 года его приговорили к 12 годам тюрьмы. Официальное расследование в отношении банка в Эстонии открыли в июле 2019 года. В центре внимания оказался тот факт, что Swedbank обманывал банки-корреспонденты и следователей, скрывая, что Абызов был главным бенефициаром структур Ru-Com. В 2015 году, когда в FIU запросили данные о владельцах нескольких фирм Ru-Com, эстонский филиал предоставил имена номинальных владельцев — хотя, как подтверждает переписка Аверсона, в банке знали, что за компаниями стоял Абызов. Два года спустя правоохранители отправили еще один запрос. Судя по утечке, банковский сотрудник обратился к коллеге за советом: «Знаю, что у тебя какие-то договоренности с Туулингом (Тоомас Туулинг — предшественник Кург на должности главы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег) касательно того, что некоторых нельзя называть, чтобы они сохранили анонимность». (Туулинг сообщил OCCRP, что это неправда, и у него «не было договоренностей с целью скрыть личность клиента или утаить информацию от властей». Он сказал, что банк не предоставил FIU информацию об Абызове, поскольку данные о бенефициарах держали отдельно от общей клиентской базы, доступной сотням сотрудников, чтобы защитить важных клиентов от возможных утечек. «Вне зависимости от того, где хранили информацию, менеджеры обязаны были передавать точные данные Комитету по работе с высокорисковыми клиентами», — добавил он.) Арест Абызова был важен для эстонского следствия, ведь требовалось доказать, что деньги, которые, предположительно, отмывали в Swedbank, — это доходы от преступной деятельности (в Эстонии, как и во многих других странах, даже при веских доказательствах отмывание денег не считается правонарушением без наличия предикатного преступления). Юридическая фирма Clifford Chance, которую Swedbank нанял после скандала 2019 года, установила, что с 2014 по 2019 год через эстонский филиал прошло более 21 миллиарда евро подозрительных транзакций. Однако в центре эстонского расследования оказалась лишь малая часть этой суммы — 53 миллиона долларов, которые, как установили правоохранители, провели через счета Абызова, прежде чем вывести на Кипр или обратно в Россию. Однако российский приговор олигарха предоставил адвокатам Swedbank уникальную возможность: они заявили, что Абызов — жертва политически мотивированного разбирательства, поскольку судья, который вел его дело, также вынес решения в пользу правительства в двух громких разбирательствах в отношении борцов с коррупцией. Защита настаивала на том, что Абызов может быть очередной жертвой кремлевского преследования. Доводы защиты о предвзятости приговора поставили правоохранителей в уязвимое положение: им требовались судебные документы из России. Из-за санкций и войны в Украине двустороннее сотрудничество между странами остановлено, и подать соответствующий запрос невозможно. Несмотря на наличие существенных доказательств обработки подозрительных транзакций, слабого документирования и контроля в Swedbank, а также компрометирующих внутренних коммуникаций, власти не смогли довести до конца один из самых громких скандалов вокруг отмывания денег в Эстонии. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли. ### Что делать, если отмывают деньги из «захваченного государства»? Эксперты по борьбе с коррупцией говорят, что произошедшее в эстонском филиале Swedbank вызывает опасения касательно возможности расследовать случаи отмывания денег c участием изолированных стран или государств под санкциями вроде России. «Это обычная ситуация, — говорит юрист Transparency International Куш Амин. — Правоохранители, которые просят правовой помощи у захваченного государства, понимают, что, скорее всего, не добьются уровня сотрудничества, необходимого для доказательства предикатного преступления к отмыванию средств. Особенно если в деле замешаны высокопоставленные чиновники или физические и юридические лица со связями в политике». Амин рассказал, что во Франции придумали возможное решение этой проблемы. Там доказательства требуют не от обвинения, а от защиты: необходимо обосновать легальность подозрительных транзакций. «Эта тактика, так называемая опровержимая презумпция, предоставляет правоохранителям лазейку в случае, если предикатное преступление совершено в стране, которая не готова сотрудничать, — говорит Амин. — Введение опровержимой презумпции — один из вариантов решения проблем, связанных, например, с отслеживанием нелегальных финансовых потоков из России». По мнению Алара Лехесметса, представителя эстонской прокуратуры, опровержимая презумпция может повысить успешность будущих расследований. «Однако пока, насколько мы знаем, законодатели не предпринимали шагов в этом направлении», — отметил он. Как говорит Маркко Кюннапу, советник в Минюсте Эстонии, получить доказательства из России было непросто и до того, как война в Украине прервала сотрудничество между странами. Тем не менее, несмотря на неудачу с Swedbank, он считает, что расследовать случаи отмывания денег с предикатными преступлениями в России возможно. ## Многие причастные к расследованию сотрудники Swedbank ушли из банковской сферы Многие банкиры, причастные к делу Swedbank, сменили сферу деятельности. Бывший гендиректор банка Китт возглавляет теплоснабжающую компанию. Состоявший в правлении Раадик — финдиректор Таллинского технического университета. Оба отказались от подробных комментариев из соображений защиты конфиденциальности. «Разбирательство было долгим; если бы у прокуратуры были ко мне какие-то претензии, дело бы не закрыли», — сообщил Раадик OCCRP. Китт сказал, что попавшие к журналистам файлы — «версия одной стороны, то есть обвинения». Адвокат Аверсона говорит, что его клиент сотрудничал со следствием. «Аверсон хочет оставить прошлое позади. Он работает в Эстонии, платит налоги и заботится о своей семье», — добавил он. Представительница эстонского филиала Swedbank сказала, что финансовое учреждение «полностью сотрудничало» с прокуратурами Эстонии и Швеции. Она добавила, что банк «неуклонно соблюдает» протоколы противодействия отмыванию денег. «Swedbank в числе банков с наименьшим уровнем риска на местном рынке и ориентирован на обслуживание местных клиентов», — сказала она. Кург, экс-контролер в Swedbank, руководит частным стартапом в сфере управления рисками. Она говорит, что произошедшее ее не отпускает. «Важно помнить, что контролеры работают не против компании, а преследуют более глобальную цель: защитить бизнес и минимизировать риски, последствия которых могут оказаться разрушительными, — пояснила она. — К сожалению, в случае Swedbank риски материализовались». 12 ноября 2024 г. 12 ноября 2024 г. ### **Присоединяйтесь.** **Привлеките власть к ответу.** [Поддержать](https://membership.occrp.org/accomplice) Поддержка читателей помогает OCCRP разоблачать организованную преступность и коррупцию по всему миру.

Avec l’un des dispositifs les plus robustes et efficaces au monde1, la France poursuit son engagement et s’applique à préserver l’intégrité de son système financier et renforcer l’efficacité de son arsenal de LCB-FT. L’évolution des méthodes de blanchiment de capitaux et de financement du terrorisme (BC-FT) utilisées par les criminels et l’émergence de nouveaux modes opératoires appellent une adaptation continue du cadre législatif et réglementaire. Retour sur un an de LCB-FT – une rétrospective en 3 volets : 1 - [Les nouvelles dispositions et orientations en matière de LCB-FT nées en 2024, au niveau européen et au niveau national](https://www.twobirds.com/fr/insights/2025/france/lcb-ft--retrospective-2024---partie-1) **2 -** **Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires** 3 - Les cryptoactifs, le nouveau hot-topic LCB-FT # Partie 2 : Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires ## 1. Les grands arrêts de la Cour de cassation en matière de blanchiment #### [Crim. 19 juin 2024, FS-B, n° 22-81.808](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000049533701?init=true&page=1&query=22-81.808&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) – Incidences du manquement d’une banque à ses obligations de vigilance en matière LCB-FT. C’est assurément l’arrêt de l’année en la matière – l’avenir dira s’il appartient aux grands arrêts qui ont les honneurs des ouvrages. Dans cet arrêt très commenté2 , la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions dans lesquelles un manquement aux obligations de vigilance imposées au titre de la législation anti-blanchiment était constitutif du délit de blanchiment au sens de l’article 324-1 du Code pénal. D’un côté, elle a pour la première fois expressément affirmé que le seul manquement d’une banque aux obligations de vigilance ne peut constituer un concours apporté à une opération de blanchiment du produit des infractions commises par son client. De l’autre, elle a justifié la condamnation de la banque dès lors qu’au regard des informations dont disposait cette dernière concernant le fonctionnement du compte litigieux, celle-ci ne pouvait ignorer l’origine frauduleuse des fonds y figurant. Dans ces conditions, la mise à disposition d’un compte bancaire dans l’un de ses établissements et l’exécution d’ordres de virement des sommes y figurant vers des comptes à l’étranger, qui sont eux des actes positifs, sont susceptibles de caractériser la participation de la banque à des opérations de blanchiment. Les commentateurs ne pourront certes y voir une responsabilité pour seul manquement aux obligations de vigilance mais les professionnels reconnaitront la finesse de la distinction opérée par la Cour. Celle-ci invite manifestement les établissements bancaires à la plus grande vigilance, dès lors que des fautes d’imprudence ou de négligence, des erreurs d’analyse ou des insuffisances de contrôles, associées à une absence de déclaration ou à une déclaration tardive, pourraient permettre de considérer qu’ils ont apporté, « en connaissance de cause », leur concours à des opérations de blanchiment. #### [Crim. 10 janvier 2024, n°](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) [22-85.721](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Portée limitée de la présomption d’illicéité des sommes objets du délit de blanchiment douanier. Dans cet arrêt, la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions pouvant conduire à une déclaration de culpabilité au titre d’un blanchiment douanier. Après avoir rappelé sa position selon laquelle le cumul des qualifications douanières et pénales pour un même fait ne porte pas atteinte au principe *non bis in idem*, la Cour a censuré la décision insuffisamment motivée des juges du fond qui s’étaient bornés, pour faire application de la présomption posée par l’article 415-1 du Code des douanes, à relever la seule impossibilité de justifier de l’origine et de la licéité des fonds. Il incombait en effet aux juges du fond non seulement de rechercher si les conditions matérielles, juridiques ou financières de l’opération d’exportation, d’importation, de transfert ou de compensation ne paraissaient obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler l’origine illicite des fonds, mais également de rechercher si elles ne paraissaient pas obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler qu’ils étaient le produit d’une des trois catégories3. Le transport sans déclaration ne suffit donc pas à caractériser le produit illicite à l’origine du blanchiment. #### [Crim. 13 mars 2024, n° 22-83.689](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000051553772?init=true&page=1&query=22-83.689&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Caractérisation de la circonstance aggravante d’habitude en matière de blanchiment. Dans cet arrêt, la chambre criminelle a apporté d’utiles précisions sur la circonstance aggravante d’habitude liée à la commission du blanchiment. Pour la première fois, elle affirmé que la circonstance d’habitude, énoncée à l’article 324-2, 1° du Code pénal, ne s’attache pas au blanchiment mais résulte de la multiplication des opérations de conversion et de dissimulation du produit de l’infraction d’origine, et ce peu important que les fonds blanchis proviennent d’un unique délit4 . Le caractère habituel s’attache ainsi non pas au à l’infraction d’origine mais aux éléments matériels du blanchiment. #### [Crim., 16 octobre 2024, n° 23-82.720](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050384866?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.720&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment. La preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment a été abordé dans un arrêt d’octobre 2024. Si les juges du fond peuvent déduire la connaissance par l’agent de l’origine criminelle ou délictuelle de l’opération de blanchiment des circonstances de fait entourant l’acte ou de sa qualité de professionnel, les éléments pris en considération doivent être suffisamment certains. Doit ainsi être censuré l’arrêt qui se fonde sur le motif hypothétique selon lequel *« il parait difficilement concevable qu’en tant que gérante, la prévenue ne se soit pas aperçue des encaissements importantes qui prévalaient sur ses comptes, et des flux financiers qui en découlaient alors qu’elle-même a perçu des sommes en contrepartie des opérations qu’elle effectuait »* pour considérer que celle-ci avait connaissance de l’origine des fonds versés sur son compte bancaire et avait eu l’intention de les dissimuler. On ne peut que saluer ce rappel à la nécessaire rigueur dans l’appréciation des comportements de blanchiment et de l’élément intentionnel, souvent trop vite balayé. #### [Crim. 4 septembre 2024, n° 22-87.061](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050192590?init=true&page=1&query=+22-87.061+&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) et [Crim. 18 septembre 2024, n° 23-82.477](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050290543?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.477&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Rappels en matière de prescription Aux termes de deux arrêts plus confidentiels, la Cour a également a fait quelques rappels utiles en matière de prescription et des délais spécifiques en matière d’infraction occulte ou dissimulée. D’une part, lorsque le délit est occulte ou dissimulé, le point de la prescription doit être reporté à la date de la dénonciation des faits au ministère public ayant permis la révélation du délit. Tel est notamment le cas lorsque les transferts de fonds provenant de délits de blanchiment d’abus de confiance et d’abus de biens sociaux vers des comptes étrangers ont été entrepris selon des modalités destinées à dissimuler tant l’existence des investissements à l’étranger que les revenus générés, notamment à l’aide d’une comptabilité irrégulière et d’opérations financières ou comptables complexes faisant obstacle à tout traçabilité5 . D’autre part, elle précise que l’opération de blanchiment doit s’entendre non seulement de l’opération de placement initial des fonds sur un compte occulte mais également des opérations de réemploi de ces fonds, le tout constituant des opérations de dissimulation, placement et conversion ; de telle sorte que c’est la dernière de ces opérations qui doit être retenue dans la détermination du point de départ du délai de prescription6. ## 2. Répression judiciaire et réglementaire du blanchiment : les affaires qui ont marqué 2024 Les acteurs du monde bancaire et financier, premiers exposés au risque de poursuites et de sanction en matière LCB-FT, n’ont évidemment pas été épargnés par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires, qui ont prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions qui ont attiré notre attention, en France évidemment, mais également à l’étranger. ### 2.1 En France Après une année 2023 marquée par la confirmation de la sanction du géant UBS, 2024 marque la troisième année consécutive qu’une convention judiciaire d’intérêt public (CJIP) est conclue en matière de blanchiment, impliquant un établissement bancaire. Une CJIP a en effet été conclue le 27 août 2024 entre le procureur de la République financier et la société **Danske Bank A/S**, puis validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris le 18 septembre 20247 . Une information judiciaire, ouverte en avril 2015, avait mis en évidence des flux financiers constitutifs de fraude fiscale commis par la gérante de la société Decobat, lesquels transitaient par des comptes ouverts en Estonie, dans des livres de la succursale estonienne de la Danske Bank, la Sampo Bank. La gérante de Decobat avait été condamnée en janvier 2024, par comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité (CRPC), des infractions de fraude fiscale et blanchiment de fraude fiscale. Danske Bank A/S avait quant à elle été mise en examen en février 2019 du chef de blanchiment de fraude fiscale en bande organisée. Il lui était en substance reproché d’avoir ouvert des comptes de passage fictifs destinés à recevoir de l’argent provenant de fraudes fiscales en bande organisée et d’avoir permis que ces comptes soient débités de multiples opérations dépourvues de justification économique, de sorte que ces opérations n’avaient d’autres but que de masquer la destination des fonds détournés et d’en faire bénéficier les destinataires à l’étranger. Le montant de l’amende d’intérêt public (6 028 799 euros) a été validé, notamment *« eu égard à la coopération active de la société, aux mesures correctrices engagées, et à la pertinence des investigations internes menées dans le cadre des poursuites engagées par les régulateurs danois et américains »*. L’intérêt des autorités de poursuites pour les acteurs institutionnels du secteur bancaire et financier a été confirmé par un de ses principaux acteurs : lors d’une récente conférence tenue à l’initiative du Directeur Général des Douanes et des droits indirects, le Procureur de la République Financier a rappelé que *« près 30 % des procédures du PNF visent l’infraction de blanchiment »*, soit au dernier comptage de la synthèse annuelle 2024, près de 230 procédures en cours8 . Ce n’est pas tout : l’autorité judiciaire est par ailleurs concurrencée par les autorités de sanction des régulateurs sectoriels, également très actives en 2024. La commission des sanctions de l’**ACPR** a ainsi rendu trois décisions dans le secteur bancaire, dont deux portant sur des manquements liés à la LCB-FT. La première concerne l’établissement de monnaie électronique **Treezor**, qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un million d’euros pour divers manquements très sérieux, qui affectaient gravement plusieurs éléments fondamentaux du dispositif de LCB-FT9. En particulier, il était reproché à la société de ne pas avoir déterminé, au moment du contrôle, un profil de risque de ses relations d’affaires lui permettant de respecter son obligation de vigilance constante. Son dispositif de surveillance des opérations était par ailleurs, sur de nombreux points, insuffisant. En plus d’une carence de son dispositif à l’origine de déclarations de soupçon tardives, des défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclarations de soupçon ont été relevés par la Commission. La fixation de la sanction pécuniaire a cependant tenu compte, dans le respect du principe de proportionnalité, des importantes actions de remédiation entreprises par Treezor et de sa situation financière. La seconde décision a été prononcée à l’encontre de la Banque régionale d’escompte et de dépôt (**BRED**), qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un montant de 2,5 millions d’euros à raison, outre plusieurs défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclaration de soupçon, de défaillances significatives dans son dispositif de surveillance des opérations. En l’occurrence, celles-ci étaient de nature à affecter sa capacité à identifier et traiter efficacement les opérations atypiques (exclusion de certains comptes du champ du dispositif automatisé de surveillance, paramétrage inapproprié de certains scénarios, informations incomplètes sur le revenu ou le chiffre d’affaires dans la base clients, motivation insuffisante du classement sans suite des alertes, notamment)10. La Commission des sanctions de l’**AMF** a également prononcé plusieurs sanctions en lien avec des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT. Dès janvier 2024, des sanctions pécuniaires ont été infligées à la société **SPI** (20 000 euros) et à son ancien dirigeant (10 0000 euros)11. Était notamment fait grief à la SPI de ne pas avoir disposé d’une procédure LCB-FT opérationnelle (les documents remis par elle à la mission de contrôle étant de simples modèles vierges établis par l’association professionnelle à laquelle elle adhère, lesquels ne peuvent être considérés comme une procédure LCB-FT et, *a fortiori*, opérationnelle) et de ne pas avoir mentionné le niveau de risque du client correspondant à la classification établie par la cartographie figurant dans ce dispositif. Au mois de juin, un blme et une sanction pécuniaire de 10 000 euros ont été prononcées à l’encontre de la société **Activ Finance Conseils**12. Parmi les griefs invoqués, il lui était reproché de ne pas avoir respecté ses obligations en matière de LCB-FT (notamment en ne collectant pas l’intégralité des cartographies des risques et des autres documents par la procédure de LCB-FT qu’elle avait adoptée). L’ensemble des manquements commis par la société ont été imputés à la dirigeant de l’époque, à l’encontre de laquelle un blme a également été prononcé. Un mois plus tard, un avertissement a été prononcé à l’encontre de la société de gestion de portefeuille **Inter Gestion REIM** et de ses dirigeants13. Des sanctions de 300 000 et 15 000 euros ont également été respectivement prononcées à leur égard. En l’occurrence, la société avait manqué à toute une série d’obligations, dont celle d’établir un dispositif LCB-FT adéquat et opérationnel puis d’en assurer l’effectivité (étaient notamment relevés : le caractère lacunaire des diligences effectuées au passif et à l’actif des fonds, l’absence de modalités d’échange automatique d’informations avec l’administration fiscale, ou encore l’absence de formation régulière du personnel). Le 12 septembre 2024, la Commission des Sanction de l’AMF a sanctionné la société de gestion de portefeuille **Sogenial Immobilier** et son président, et prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions pécuniaires d’un montant respectif de 150 000 euros et de 30 000 euros14. La société n’avait, entre autres, pas réalisé toutes les diligences de LCB-FT, ni lors d’investissements réalisés pour le compte des fonds gérés, ni à l’égard de clients ayant souscrit dans une SCPI, et n’avait pas mis en œuvre sa procédure LCB-FT. ### 2.2 À l’étranger Si la France est particulièrement active sur le plan judiciaire et réglementaire dans la lutte contre le blanchiment et la prévention des risques associés, d’autres pays se sont également illustrés cette année, par l’importance, aux plans théorique ou pécuniaire, des sanctions prononcées contre des acteurs du secteur financier. À **Monaco**, quelques mois après l’ajout de la principauté sur la « liste grise » de surveillance renforcée du GAFI, deux anciens banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende de 10 000 euros et à des peines d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir participé dans le blanchiment de millions d’euros déposés en espèces par deux hommes d’affaires italiens. Dans une affaire connexe de l’affaire, trois autres banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende comprise entre 5000 et 7000 euros pour non-déclaration de dépôts en espèces suspects. En **Suisse**, le procès en appel lié à la « Bulgarian Connection » s’était ouvert en automne devant le Tribunal pénal fédéral. La Cour d’appel a finalement acquitté la banque **UBS** – qui avait hérité de cette affaire après l’absorption du Crédit Suisse plus tôt dans l’année – du chef de blanchiment d’argent aggravé. Elle a néanmoins confirmé partiellement les condamnations de deux coprévenus pour leurs activités en lien avec une organisation criminelle bulgare active dans le trafic de stupéfiants et le blanchiment d’argent15. A l’instar de la France, la **Suisse** et les différents membres de l’Union Européenne disposent, à côté des autorités de poursuites judiciaires, de puissants régulateurs du secteur bancaire et financier dont le niveau d’implication dans la poursuite des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT est en constante augmentation, à l’image des sanctions pécuniaires qu’elles imposent. Ainsi, en Suisse, au terme d’une procédure d’*enforcement*, l’Autorité fédérale de surveillance des marchés financiers (FINMA), a prononcé une confiscation de 12,7 millions de francs suisses *« indûment obtenus »* à l’encontre de la banque privée **Mirabaud & Cie SA** pour avoir manqué à ses obligations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et avoir gravement enfreint les règles du droit des marchés financiers. Elle a notamment considéré que la banque n’avait pas suffisamment vérifié et documenté les ayants droit économiques de nombreuses transactions, alors même qu’il existait des indices de risques accrus de blanchiment d’argent et que des signaux d’alertes concernant ces relations d’affaires avaient été émis16 . L’équivalent de la FINMA en **Allemagne**, l’Autorité Fédérale de Supervision Financière (BaFin) a sanctionné la banque **N26 Bank AG** à une amende de 9,2 millions d’euros pour des insuffisances lors de déclarations de soupçons en 2022. Sont notamment reprochés à la banque en ligne des retards systématiques dans la transmission des soupçons de blanchiment d’argent. Cette amende s’ajoute à celle de 4,25 millions d’euros, prononcée en 2021 pour des failles dans son dispositif de prévention du blanchiment. En **Suède**, **Klarna** a été sanctionnée à une amende de 500 millions de couronnes suédoises (près de 45 millions d’euros) par l’autorité de surveillance financière suédoise *(Finansinspektionen)* pour divers manquements. Lui sont reprochées d’importantes lacunes dans l’évaluation générale des risques ainsi que l’absence de procédures et de lignes directrices permettant d’identifier les situations dans lesquelles des mesures de diligence raisonnable devaient être prises pour les clients utilisant leur produit de facturation. L’année 2024 aura également été productive pour la *Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)* britannique, qui a infligé de lourdes amendes pour des manquements à la législation sur le blanchiment d’argent : 16,7 millions de livres sterling (19,2 millions d’euros) à **Metro Bank** pour manquement aux contrôles de lutte contre le blanchiment et défaut de surveillance des transactions ; 3,5 millions de livres sterling (4,1 millions d’euros) à la plateforme de cryptomonnaies **Coinbase** pour des lacunes dans la conception et le suivi des procédures de vérification des clients ; et près de 29 millions de livres sterling (35 millions d’euros) à la banque Starling pour *« laxisme choquant »* dans ses contrôles anti-blanchiment. Si on ignore encore quelle sera la magnitude des dernières lubies du Président américain en matière de lutte contre les infractions économiques et financières (et notamment la « pause » forcée du *Foreign Corrupt Practice Act* (FCPA) annoncée aux premières lueurs de l’année 2025), on se souviendra qu’avant le cataclysme, le DOJ prenait sa part dans l’effort mené par les autorités judiciaires et de régulation dans la lutte contre le blanchiment. La banque canadienne Toronto-Dominion Bank (**TD Bank**) a ainsi accepté de plaider coupable aux Etats-Unis pour une infraction à la législation américaine en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment. Il lui était reproché d’avoir permis à trois réseaux de blanchir plus de 670 millions de dollars et d’avoir manqué à ses obligations de contrôle de des transactions pendant près de 10 ans. La banque doit désormais s’acquitter d’une pénalité de 3 milliards de dollars et modifier ses procédures internes17. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ [1] [Plan d\\'action pour lutter contre le blanchiment de capitaux, le financement du terrorisme et de la prolifération d\\'armes de destruction massive (2021-2022)](https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=CBFBD522-0731-4DBE-919B-3B8E1340F2D1&filename=811%20-%20Plan%20d%27action%20pour%20lutter%20contre%20le%20blanchiment%20de%20capitaux%2C%20le%20financement%20du%20terrorisme%20et%20de%20la%20prolif%C3%A9ration%202021-2022.pdf).

The manager of Decobat was convicted in January 2024 for tax fraud and laundering of tax fraud. Danske Bank A/S was indicted in February 2019 for laundering of organized tax fraud, accused of opening fictitious transit accounts to receive money from organized tax fraud and allowing these accounts to be debited through multiple unjustified transactions to conceal the destination of misappropriated funds and benefit foreign recipients.

How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank?](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/danske-bank-case-money-laundering-scandal-1130#how-modern-tools-prevent-cases-like-danske-bank) Between 2007 and 2015, the global financial system faced one of the most significant [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/anti-money-laundering-aml-49) failures in modern history, in which Danske Bank ([Denmark](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-denmark-245)’s largest financial institution) was implicated in a [money laundering](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/money-laundering-122) scandal amounting to over $230 billion in suspicious transactions. This scandal occurred around the bank’s Estonian branch. It both exposed critical compliance lapses and reshaped how financial institutions and regulators approach AML globally. What Was the Danske Bank Money Laundering Scandal? -------------------------------------------------- Over an eight-year period, suspicious transactions worth over $230 billion flowed predominantly from countries that are outside the EU such as [Russia](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-russia-127), [Azerbaijan](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-azerbaijan-159), and Moldova. The regulatory and AML systems in the Baltic region were actually weak at the time and unsurprisingly, they were exploited in no time. So, how was this done? The majority of these payments were processed through [offshore](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/offshore-1165) entities with minimal scrutiny which enabled illicit actors to funnel vast sums of money through Estonia, all under the guise of legitimacy. How Did the Scandal Come to Light? ---------------------------------- A former employee of Danske Bank’s Estonian branch, Howard Wilkinson acted as an in-formant and revealed systemic issues within the bank’s operations. The most striking insight about the issues was the flagging inadequacies in the handling of non-resident client accounts in 2017. The actual scope of the violations came to light after subsequent investigations by Danish and [Estonian](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-estonia-95) regulators. This was followed by the resignation of the bank’s CEO and involvement of multiple jurisdictions, including the [United States](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-united-states-of-america-80) and the United Kingdom, who proceeded to launch formal probes to determine the extent of the misconduct and who was accountable. The revelations unsurprisingly resulted in a sharp decline in Danske Bank. The bank was left with a sharp decline in the reputation, financial penalties and si-gnificant market value losses. [![Image 16: Know your customer is an important companent of anti-money laundering process](https://www.sanctionscanner.com//assets/images/Blog/what-are-the-kyc-and-aml-checks.png)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-aml-kyc-611) Timeline of Key Events ---------------------- Over a period spanning eight years between 2007 and 2015 where the transactions processed totaling $230 billion can be referred as the starting point of the incident. It is followed by the whistleblower report triggering investigations in 2017, the resignation of CEO and the investigations expanding to international scope in 2018 and finally Estonian branch inevitably shutting down operations in 2019. Today, legal proceedings and ensuing penalties still continue. Key Compliance Failures Behind the Scandal ------------------------------------------ So far, we have only briefly touched upon the compliance failures behind this scandal. Since, it is serves as a notable example of how multiple compliance failures may lead up to an International crisis, it would be wise to elaborate the failures behind this scandal. [**Know Your Customer (KYC)**](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/know-your-customer-kyc-46#:~:text=Sanction%20Scanner%20is%20an%20AML,can%20easily%20perform%20KYC%20checks.): First of all, poor Know Your Customer (KYC) certainly didn’t help the Estonian branch. A significant number of non-resident client accounts were accepted and the weak KYC processes, as well as risk assessment failures, created a gateway for illicit activities to occur unchecked. **[Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/what-is-sar-report-149))**: Just like the KYC procedures, ineffective Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) were inadequate as well, both in quantity and timeliness. **Transaction Monitoring Systems**: Another shortcoming was the weak transaction monitoring systems of the bank which resulted in the vast sums of money, which can always be potentially linked to money laundering or other criminal activities, to flow through the system undetected. In addition to these compliance faults, the disconnection between the Copenhagen head office and the Estonian branch certainly didn’t help avoiding a situation like this. The head office couldn’t provide sufficient oversight, auditing and accountability measure, which resulted in local compliance lapses and unaddressed potential misconduct for extended periods of time. ![Image 17](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/Key%20Compliance%20Failures%20Behind%20the%20Scandal.webp) Consequences for Danske Bank ---------------------------- Danske Bank went through several immediate and long-lasting repercussions. It goes without saying that the Estonian branch was forced to shut down operations, thus leaving a significant gap in the regional network. Unfortunately, the damage wasn’t only done to the Estonian branch. Danske Bank’s market value plummeted and key executives were compel-led to resign. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice, European authorities and various financial institutions led several investigations and the bank faced further regulatory fines and legal liabilities but on the bright side, the scandal served as a catalyst for broader AML reforms within the European Union. Why This Case Was a Turning Point for AML in Europe? ---------------------------------------------------- It’s because this scandal acted as a wake-up call for the European Commission and the commission subsequently proceeded to propose the creation of a centralized [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/top-11-aml-tools-for-2025-features-prices-use-cases-1020) regulatory body called AMLA. In addition to the AMLA, financial transaction monitoring systems have shifted to empha-size real-time oversight to enable authorities to quickly detect and mitigate risks associated with transnational money laundering by leveraging advanced technology, such as AI-driven analytics. Financial institutions are now mandated to adopt more detailed and stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols that must include additional verification steps for non-resident and high-risk clients, such as detailed background checks, ongoing monitoring of transac-tional behavior, and enhanced scrutiny for [politically exposed persons (PEPs)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/politically-exposed-person-pep-56). Another thing that set off the alarm bells was that it demonstrated how urgent it was for financial institutions to adopt a more proactive compliance culture. So, the banks and other entities implemented risk-based strategies tailored to their specific operational environments. Obviously, it depends on the needs of the business but primary examples would be regular staff training, the establishment of clear internal reporting channels, and the use of advanced tools to identify and mitigate risks related to illicit activities. [![Image 18](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/AML-Software-Sanction-Scanner.webp)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/request-demo) How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank? ------------------------------------------------ Preventing another scandal of this magnitude requires adopting cutting-edge technological solutions tailored for AML compliance. Luckily, there are tools like Sanction Scanner, which are fine examples of how technology can be used to empower financial institutions to detect and mitigate financial crime risks. Let’s come to the what these technologies can deliver. Real-Time Name Screening, Automated Transaction Monitoring and Comprehensive Risk Assessments serve as good examples that incorporate competent algorithms and AI models.

The case marks a profound turning point for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in the banking sector. The exposure of the scandal revealed that billions of euros were laundered through its Estonian branch. It turned out that the existing AML control mechanisms were far from sufficient to prevent such illegal activities. This realization sparked a compliance revolution aimed at preventing future system failures and preserving the integrity of the financial market. ## The Exposure of a Gigantic Money Laundering Network The Danske Bank scandal embodies one of the most severe cases of money laundering within the European banking sector. The revelation that the bank\\'s Estonian branch served as a hub for dubious money flows caused significant uproar. It painted a picture of convoluted transaction paths, the ends of which were shrouded in darkness. The uncovering of the scandal provided initial hints at this. Over the years, funds amounting to more than 200 billion euros with suspicious origins found their way through the financial institution. Between 2007 and 2015, money laundering activities took place through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. The scale and complexity of these activities were only fully understood after intense investigations. Thousands of suspicious transactions, involving billions of dollars, were carried out without the necessary AML controls being effective. The Danske Bank affair has exposed the Achilles\\' heel of the financial world: effective mechanisms to prevent money laundering are not only desirable but vital for the integrity of the entire banking system. Internal security systems should be capable of identifying and reporting such massive movements. However, at Danske Bank, these systems failed entirely. This realization has highlighted an urgent need for a profound transformation in the approach to combating money laundering in the European banking sector. Key aspects: * Identification of opaque money flows * Failures in the internal control system * Revision of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) guidelines The significance of the case is partly due to the involvement of a well-known bank: Danske Bank. This has severely impacted its trust among customers and within the financial world. The case prompted a detailed investigation of the incident, scrutinizing the corporate culture and the compliance structure, which proved inadequate for managing money laundering risks. | **Area** | **Description** | **Consequence** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Revelation** | Fake customers and suspicious money flows | Stricter AML regulations and monitoring | | **Financial Volume** | Over €200 billion in suspicious transfers | Investigations and penalties | | **Control Systems** | Failure in detection and reporting | Concerns about risk management infrastructure | | **International Impact** | Affects the reputation of the entire European banking sector | Loss of trust and demands for transparency | ## ## **Scale and Consequences of the Money Laundering Affair** Following the revelation of the money laundering affair, the financial world is now focused on its enormous scope and severe consequences. The suspicious transactions that were uncovered shed light on the existing regulatory deficits in the banking sector and the necessity for effective anti-money laundering measures. ### **Dimensions of the Scandal** The dimensions of the affair are staggering: A gigantic volume of suspicious money transactions remained undetected for years. This indicates that both the financial supervision and the internal control mechanisms of the affected institutions failed. It is clear that despite existing regulations, there was a lack of consistent implementation. ### **Responses from the Financial World and Regulators** The response from the European Central Bank and national financial regulatory authorities was a comprehensive suite of actions. Their measures ranged from tightening regulatory protocols to discussions about ethical responsibility in the financial sector. These incidents have led to a rethinking and the development of new strategies in the fight against money laundering to restore public trust. ### **Economic and Reputational Damage** The reputational damage is immense. The affected bank not only struggled with losses in its stock value but also faced a profound crisis of confidence that questioned the credibility of the entire sector. The long-term effects of this crisis are not yet fully apparent. However, it is clear that comprehensive and sustainable reforms are necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future. These reforms are intended to bolster the integrity and accountability within the financial sector. ## **AML-Anti Money Laundering: Principles and Challenges** Combating money laundering, known as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), is a fundamental pillar in the financial sector. It aims to ensure the integrity and stability of the market. Banks and financial institutions are required to adhere to strict compliance guidelines to efficiently detect and prevent money laundering activities. Effective risk management plays a fundamental role in AML compliance. The identification, assessment, and management of risks are key elements in developing sustainable strategies against these threatening practices. Due diligence procedures, which involve the careful scrutiny of business partners, are also essential to counter potential threats and meet strict regulatory requirements. | **Basic Principle** | **Challenges** | **Strategies** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Customer Identification (KYC)** | Inefficiency in data collection | Automated verification systems | | **Transaction Monitoring** | False positive alerts | Refinement of algorithms | | **Due Diligence Procedures** | Lack of transparency | Extended due diligence checks | | **Suspicious Activity Reporting** | Timely capture of data | Training and clear procedural workflows | | **Risk Assessment** | Changing risk landscape | Dynamic risk models | The challenges in anti-money laundering are diverse and complex. Given the constantly changing methods of money laundering, financial institutions must remain agile and continuously adapt their AML systems. It is not only crucial to identify risks; comprehensive compliance guidelines are decisive in preventing future scandals. They help to strengthen public trust in the banking sector. ## **The European Context and the Role of Instant Payments** The money laundering activities of Danske Bank have exposed the interconnections within the European banking sector. It becomes clear that money laundering is not an isolated problem of a single institution. Rather, it represents a systemic risk that requires a coordinated response at the European and global level. In this context, the role of instant payments must be considered. On one hand, they accelerate payment transactions. On the other hand, they pose new challenges for AML compliance. The integration of effective AML controls into instant payment processes is crucial. ## The Role of Technology and Innovation in AML Compliance With the advent of disruptive technologies, the approach to risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements has fundamentally changed. In the fight against financial crimes such as money laundering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced AML technologies have become indispensable tools. They not only significantly enhance efficiency in AML processes but also contribute substantially to fraud detection and the prevention of financial crimes. ## Laws and Regulations for Combating Money Laundering **Switzerland** In Switzerland, money laundering is combated through the following laws and regulations: **Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG):** This law, applicable to financial intermediaries, regulates the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It also ensures due diligence in financial transactions. **Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GwV):** This ordinance regulates the professional practice of acting as a financial intermediary. It also sets out the supervisory and reporting obligations for traders. **FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GWV-FINMA):** This ordinance specifies how financial intermediaries must fulfill their obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. **EU** Money Laundering Directive: The EU\\'s Money Laundering Directive was enacted in 1991 and has been revised several times since then. The EU regulations aim to protect the EU\\'s financial system. It is the responsibility of each EU member state to transpose the Money Laundering Directive into national law. Regulation to Combat Money Laundering: In July 2021, the European Commission presented a package of legislative proposals. These proposals aim to further strengthen and improve the enforcement of EU regulations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT). The package envisages the establishment of an EU authority to combat money laundering, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for credit and financial institutions. Additionally, the package includes regulations on obligations of the private sector and a revised regulation on money transfers. **Germany** Money Laundering Act (GwG): The German Money Laundering Act is the legal implementation of the EU Directive of 2015 and aims at effectively prosecuting money launderers. It has been revised multiple times and has been in its current version since July 2, 2023. Criminal Code (StGB): According to § 261 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), \"money laundering\" is punishable in Germany. Individuals who conceal, use, or dispose of unlawfully acquired assets are committing a criminal offense. The Role of Regulatory Authorities Regulatory authorities such as the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) play a central role in combating money laundering in Switzerland. Similarly, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) plays a crucial role in combating money laundering in Germany. They are responsible for monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations at banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions. Independent asset managers and trustees in Switzerland are indirectly supervised through the Supervisory Organization (SO) by the regulatory authority (AO). In addition, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) exist here, which non-prudentially supervised financial service providers must join. The SROs are in turn approved and supervised by FINMA. In Germany, BaFin also pursues a preventive approach to combating money laundering. The BaFin regulatory authority is supported by the Federal Office for Combating Financial Market Crime (BBF), established in October 2023, as a federal supervisory authority. It consolidates supervision, analysis, and criminal investigations into money laundering matters. The automated functionality of this tool provides a time- and resource-saving way to identify risks. At the same time, it allows the compliance team to focus more on strategic case management. This optimization of workflow ensures efficient use of relevant resources, while companies maintain the highest standards of compliance and risk prevention. ## Future Challenges in Combating Money Laundering The increasing digitization, growing global financial flows, and cryptocurrencies pose new challenges for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). As money laundering is a global issue, addressing it requires not only adapting existing control mechanisms but also enhanced international cooperation. In addition to ongoing adjustments to laws and regulations, there is a need to harmonize them across borders. Strengthening collaboration at the international level is crucial because criminals\\' methods are becoming more sophisticated. Criminals are now utilizing cryptocurrencies for money laundering, adding complexity to detection efforts. Authorities and investigators are placing high hopes on the use of new methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in combating money laundering. These new technologies will play a significant role in fraud detection and identifying anomalies in financial transactions. ## Conclusion The harrowing tale of the Danske Bank scandal has exposed a shocking truth about the banking sector, revealing the severe consequences of inadequate AML compliance. Numerous lessons have been drawn from this money laundering affair, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive control mechanisms and transparent financial flows. Banks are challenged not only to react to scandals but to proactively act as elements in the fight against criminal financial activities. The future of AML compliance will increasingly be shaped by digital innovations and the integration of advanced technologies. This requires investments in intelligent solutions capable of identifying and analyzing even the most sophisticated suspicions. The pursuit of a seamless compliance culture generates a growing demand for skilled professionals. These professionals must be trained not only in the analysis of large volumes of data but also in relationship-building and due diligence. Given the events surrounding the Danske Bank, the need for dynamic, adaptable, and internationally coordinated AML policies is evident. The pioneers for a secure banking world in the 21st century are institutions that consider transparency and integrity as part of their corporate philosophy. They view these values not only as legal requirements but as essential elements in restoring public trust. Together, the sector can create resilient structures that are resistant to the threats of financial crime. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening as a Solution The Pythagoras Transaction Screening module is the optimal solution for reviewing incoming and outgoing payments.

It alleges that over €200 billion in suspicious funds were laundered through Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The scandal exposed significant failures in Danske Bank's internal AML (Anti-Money Laundering) control mechanisms, which were insufficient to detect and prevent illegal activities. The case led to investigations, regulatory scrutiny, and penalties, and highlighted the need for stricter AML regulations and improved compliance structures within Danske Bank and the broader European banking sector.

Lenahan-Pfahlert](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/l/lenahan-pfahlert-kelly) on September 4, 2024 Posted in [Civil Penalty](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/civil-penalty/), [Compliance Program](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/compliance-program/), [Correspondent Bank Accounts](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/correspondent-bank-accounts/), [Customer Due Diligence](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/customer-due-diligence/), [New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/new-york-department-of-financial-services/), [Panama Papers](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/panama-papers/), [Transaction Monitoring](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/transaction-monitoring/) ![Image 2](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/09/AdobeStock_56312148-656x437.jpeg) On August 27, 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) [announced](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20240827) a [consent order](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/08/ea20240827-co-nordea.pdf) involving a $35 million settlement with Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) for alleged significant failures related to anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance. Nordea, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, operates globally, including through a licensed branch in New York, [which has its own AML and transaction monitoring requirements](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2017/01/2016-year-in-review-nydfs-finalizes-broad-aml-regulations/). The enforcement action, which followed revelations from the [Panama Papers leak](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/12/first-u-s-indictment-relating-to-panama-papers-charges-lawyer-asset-manager-accountant-and-client/), found that Nordea allegedly failed to conduct proper due diligence on high-risk correspondent banking relationships and maintained inadequate AML controls. According to the NYDFS, the Panama Papers implicated Nordea in aiding clients in establishing offshore shell companies in order to facilitate illicit activities. The consent order alleges that Nordea violated New York law by allowing compliance failures in its AML program and procedures to persist. Meanwhile, [Danish officials recently charged Nordea](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/denmark-takes-nordea-court-possible-breaches-anti-money-laundering-act-2024-07-05/) with repeatedly violating Denmark’s anti-money laundering act between 2012 and 2015, thereby exposing Nordea, potentially, [to extremely significant fines](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/11/nordea-risks-money-laundering-fine-near-1-billion-experts-say/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Nordea%20Bank%20could,exceed%20the%20lender%27s%20own%20expectations.). As we will discuss, although the consent order implicates many different issues, the NYDFS enforcement action represents, in part, the latest chapter in the continued fall-out from the [massive AML scandal involving Dankse Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2023/01/sdny-sentences-danske-bank-in-massive-aml-scandal/). The consent order also highlights, once again, the particular risks posed by correspondent banking relationships, on which we repeatedly have blogged (for example, [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2021/03/amla-expands-doj-grand-jury-subpoena-power-over-correspondent-bank-accounts-and-foreign-banks/), [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/10/fincen-solicits-commentary-on-due-diligence-for-correspondent-and-private-bank-accounts/), and [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/06/28-north-korean-and-5-chinese-bankers-accused-of-a-2-5-billion-laundering-scheme/)). ### _Key Takeaways_ The Consent Order reflects that the NYDFS made the following findings: 1. **Deficient AML Program**: Nordea’s AML program, particularly within its Baltic branches (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and the International Branch in Denmark, exhibited significant deficiencies. These included insufficient policies and procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious activities, exposing the bank to heightened risks of money laundering. 2. **Inadequate Due Diligence**: Nordea failed to conduct adequate due diligence on its correspondent banking relationships. Failure to properly assess the risks associated with the banking parties may have facilitated money laundering. 3. **Insufficient Transaction Monitoring**: Nordea’s transaction monitoring system was inadequate, further exacerbating the risks associated with its AML compliance failures. 4. **High-Risk Transactions**: The NYDFS linked Nordea’s Baltic operations to billions of dollars in high-risk transactions. These transactions underscored the vulnerabilities in the bank’s control mechanisms. 5. **Prior Regulatory Warnings**: Regulatory bodies in Nordic countries previously identified weaknesses in Nordea’s AML compliance programs. Despite these warnings, the bank did not take adequate measures to address the identified issues, allowing the risks to persist. ### _Challenges in the Baltic Branches_ According to NYDFS, Nordea’s Baltic branches faced significant challenges in managing money laundering risks, particularly concerning customers from post-Soviet states with high corruption indices. Despite recognizing these risks, the bank’s efforts to enhance its AML compliance between 2010 and 2017 were insufficient. Audits conducted during this period revealed an overreliance on manual monitoring, inadequate customer identification data, and persistent shortcomings in Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) and Enhanced Due Diligence (“EDD”) processes. These issues left the bank vulnerable to financial crimes. ### _Issues at the International Branch at Vesterport_ Nordea’s International Branch in Vesterport, Denmark (“VIB”), which primarily served corporate customers with connections to Russia and Eastern Europe, was implicated in numerous money laundering scandals, including the Panama Papers, [Russian Laundromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Laundromat), and [Azerbaijani Laundromat](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat). Audits conducted in 2009 and 2013 allegedly identified significant gaps in CDD, EDD, and transaction monitoring processes. These deficiencies, coupled with media scrutiny and increased inquiries from correspondent banks, ultimately led to the branch’s closure in 2014. ### _Nordea’s Correspondent Banking and RMA Relationships_ Nordea maintained extensive correspondent banking relationships and exchanged SWIFT Relationship Management Application (“RMA”) keys with various financial institutions, including Danske Bank, ABLV, and Bank of Cyprus. The NYDFS found that Nordea failed to adequately manage and monitor the risks associated with these relationships. **Danske Bank** [Danske Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2019/03/massive-danske-bank-money-laundering-scandal-continues-to-unfold/), headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, had a significant correspondent banking relationship with Nordea, with substantial annual cross-border payment traffic. Despite adverse findings from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in 2012 and other issues, Nordea assigned Danske an AML risk class “A” rating in 2013. However, internal reviews in 2016 and 2017 identified significant compliance failures, necessitating a downgrade in Danske’s AML risk rating and increased monitoring. **ABLV** ABLV Bank, based in Latvia, [was identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) in 2018 as a primary money laundering concern](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/02/fincen-imposes-section-311-fifth-special-measure-on-latvian-bank-ablv/). Despite identifying numerous red flags, Nordea delayed terminating its relationship with ABLV until after FinCEN’s notice. NYDFS determined that this delay exposed Nordea to significant risks and highlighted the need for more timely and effective AML compliance measures. **Bank of Cyprus** The Bank of Cyprus, known for its associations with Russia, allegedly posed substantial money laundering risks. Despite identifying high risks and red flags, NYDFS found that Nordea maintained its relationship with the bank until 2019. Internal audits and KYC reviews allegedly revealed gaps in Nordea’s due diligence regarding the Bank of Cyprus. In 2015, Nordea’s internal audit revealed deficiencies in KYC procedures, including insufficient Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) screening, and lack of site visits at the Bank of Cyprus. The KYC file from that year flagged additional risks, including Cyprus’s status as an offshore financial center and ineffective financial oversight. Notably, the file identified three PEPs on the board of Bank of Cyprus, including a former KGB agent and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. It was not until 2023 that Nordea had fully exited its association with the Bank of Cyprus, closing all RMAs except those required by prior guarantees. ### _Transaction Monitoring_ In 2008, Nordea implemented an IT-supported transaction monitoring system, fully operational by 2010. Initially, the system included three monitoring scenarios, expanding to six by 2013, but did not cover correspondent banking transactions. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority identified these deficiencies in 2015, prompting Nordea to introduce 28 new monitoring scenarios in 2016, specifically for correspondent banking risks. Despite these enhancements, Nordea Bank Finland faced challenges integrating transaction data into the automated system, leading to the development of semi-automated controls by mid-2018. Additionally, Nordea allegedly failed to prevent transactions involving ABLV due to delays in updating internal sanctions lists, resulting in breaches of internal sanctions standards. Between 2016 and 2018, flagged transactions related to the Bank of Cyprus were not addressed, and the relationship continued until 2019. NYDFS acknowledged Nordea’s efforts to improve transaction monitoring but noted ongoing significant challenges and areas requiring improvement. ### _The Consent Order_ As part of the settlement, Nordea agreed to several measures to address the deficiencies identified by the NYDFS in addition to the $35 million monetary penalty. These measures include: 1. **Strengthening the AML Compliance Program**: Nordea committed to enhancing its AML policies, procedures, and controls to better detect and prevent money laundering activities. 2. **Enhancing Transaction Monitoring**: The bank agreed to upgrade its transaction monitoring system to more effectively identify and report suspicious activities. 3. **Rigorous Due Diligence on Correspondent Banking Relationships**: Nordea will conduct more thorough due diligence on its correspondent banking partners to ensure compliance with AML standards. 4. **Independent Compliance Review**: An independent consultant will be appointed to assess Nordea’s compliance with the Consent Order, providing recommendations for further improvements and ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon measures. 5. **Regular Progress Reports**: Nordea is required to submit periodic progress reports to the NYDFS, detailing the steps taken to comply with the Consent Order and the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

Der Fall markiert einen tiefgreifenden Wendepunkt für die Anti-Money Laundry (AML)-Richtlinien im Bankensektor. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals offenbarte, dass Milliarden von Euro durch die estnische Filiale gewaschen wurden. Es stellte sich heraus, dass die vorhandenen AML-Kontrollmechanismen bei weitem nicht ausreichten, um derartige illegale Aktivitäten zu unterbinden. Diese Erkenntnis löste eine Compliance-Revolution aus, um ein künftiges Versagen der Systeme zu verhindern und die Integrität des Finanzmarktes zu wahren.** ## Die Enthüllung eines gigantischen Geldwäsche Netzwerkes Der Danske Bank Skandal verkörpert einen der gravierendsten Geldwäsche-Fälle innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors. Hohe Wellen schlug die Enthüllung, dass die estnische Filiale der Bank als Drehscheibe für dubiose Geldflüsse diente. Es entstand ein Bild verschlungener Transaktionskosten, deren Enden sich im Dunklen verloren. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals gab erste Hinweise darauf. Über die Jahre hinweg fanden Gelder in Höhe von mehr als 200 Milliarden Euro mit verdächtiger Herkunft ihren Weg durch das Finanzinstitut. Zwischen 2007 und 2015 fanden Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten statt. Diese Aktivitäten erfolgten über die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank. Ihr Umfang und ihre Komplexität wurden erst nach intensiven Ermittlungen vollends verstanden. Tausende verdächtige Transaktionen, die Milliarden von Dollar umfassten, wurden durchgeführt, ohne dass die erforderlichen AML-Kontrollen greifen konnten. * Die Affäre um die Danske Bank hat die Achillesferse der Finanzwelt blossgestellt: Effektive Mechanismen zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche sind nicht nur wünschenswert, sondern überlebenswichtig für die Integrität des gesamten Bankwesens. Die internen Sicherheitssysteme sollten in der Lage sein, solch massive Bewegungen zu identifizieren und zu melden. Bei der Danske Bank versagten diese jedoch auf ganzer Linie. Diese Erkenntnis trägt dazu bei, dass ein dringender Bedarf für eine tiefgreifende Transformation des Geldwäschebekämpfung Ansatzes im europäischen Bankensektor offengelegt wurde. * **Kennzeichnung undurchsichtiger Geldflüsse** * **Rollen Versäumnisse im internen Kontrollsystem** * **Überarbeitung von AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Richtlinien** Die Brisanz des Falles liegt unter anderem in der Beteiligung einer namhaften Bank: der Danske Bank. Diese sieht ihr Vertrauen bei Kundinnen und Kunden sowie innerhalb der Finanzwelt stark in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Der Fall zog eine detaillierte Untersuchung des Vorfalls nach sich. Dabei wurden die Unternehmenskultur und die Compliance-Struktur unter die Lupe genommen. Sie haben sich als unzureichend für das Management von Geldwäscherisiken erwiesen. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Bereich** | **Beschreibung** | **Konsequenz** | | Enthüllung | Unechte Kunden und verdächtige Geldflüsse | Stärkere AML-Vorgaben und Überwachung | | Finanzielles Volumen | Über 200 Milliarden Euro verdächtige Transfers | Untersuchungen und Strafen | | Kontrollsysteme | Versagen bei der Erkennung und Meldung | Bedenken zur Risikomanagement Infrastruktur | | Internationale Wirkung | Betrifft Reputation des gesamten Europäischen Bankensektors | Vertrauensverlust und Forderung nach Transparenz | ## ## Ausmass und Folgen der Geldwäsche-Affäre Nach dem Bekanntwerden der Geldwäsche-Affäre stehen die enorme Tragweite und die schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen im Fokus der Finanzwelt. Die aufgedeckten verdächtigen Transaktionen werfen ein Licht auf das bestehende Regulierung Defizit im Bankensektor und die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Geldwäschebekämpfung. ### Dimensionen des Skandals Die Dimensionen der Affäre sind erschütternd: Ein gigantisches Volumen an verdächtigen Geldtransaktionen blieb über Jahre hinweg unentdeckt. Dies zeigt, dass die Finanzaufsicht und die internen Kontrollmechanismen der betroffenen Institute versagt haben. Dies macht deutlich, dass es trotz existierender Vorschriften an einer konsequenten Umsetzung mangelte. ### Reaktionen der Finanzwelt und Regulatoren Die Antwort der Europäischen Zentralbank und der nationalen Finanzaufsichtsbehörden war ein Arsenal an Reaktionen. Ihre Massnahmen reichten von der Verschärfung der Regulierungsmassnahmen bis hin zur Diskussion über ethische Verantwortung im Finanzsektor. Diese Vorfälle haben zu einem Umdenken geführt. Es wurden neue Strategien im Kampf gegen die Geldwäsche entwickelt, um das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit wiederherzustellen. ### Wirtschaftliche und Reputationsschäden Der Reputationsschaden ist gewaltig. Die betroffene Bank hatte nicht nur mit Wertverlusten ihrer Aktien zu kämpfen. Sie stand ausserdem vor einer tiefgreifenden Vertrauenskrise, die die Glaubwürdigkeit des gesamten Sektors in Frage stellte. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Krise sind noch nicht vollständig absehbar. Jedoch ist klar, dass umfassende und nachhaltige Reformen notwendig sind. Diese Reformen sollen ähnliche Vorfälle in der Zukunft verhindern. ## ## AML-Anti Money Laundering: Grundsätze und Herausforderungen Die Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche, bekannt als Anti-Geldwäsche (AML), ist eine zentrale Säule im Finanzsektor. Sie dient dazu, die Integrität und Stabilität des Marktes zu gewährleisten. Banken und Finanzinstitutionen sind hierbei angehalten, strikte Compliance-Richtlinien zu befolgen, um Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten effizient aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Ein wirksames **Risikomanagement** spielt eine grundlegende Rolle in der AML-Compliance. Die Identifikation, Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken sind Schlüsselelemente, um nachhaltige Strategien gegen diese bedrohlichen Praktiken zu entwickeln. Due-Diligence-Verfahren, die sorgfältige Überprüfung von Geschäftspartnern, sind ebenfalls unerlässlich, um potenzielle Bedrohungen abzuwehren und den strengen regulatorischen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Grundprinzip** | **Herausforderungen** | **Strategien** | | Kundenidentifizierung ([KYC](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/partner-screening/?hsLang=de)) | Ineffizienz bei der Datenerhebung | Automatisierte Verifizierungssysteme | | [Transaction Monitoring](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-monitoring/?hsLang=de) | Falsch-Positive Meldungen | Verfeinerung von Algorithmen | | Due-Diligence-Verfahren | Mangel an Transparenz | Erweiterte Due-Diligence-Checks | | Meldung von Verdachtsfällen | Zeitgerechte Erfassung | Schulungen und klare Prozessabläufe | | Risikobewertung | Veränderliche Risikolandschaft | Dynamische Risikomodelle | Die Herausforderungen in der Anti-Geldwäsche sind vielfältig und komplex. Angesichts ständig ändernder Methoden der Geldwäsche müssen Finanzinstitutionen agil bleiben und ihre AML-Systeme kontinuierlich anpassen. Nicht nur das Aufspüren der Risiken spielt eine entscheidende Rolle. Die ganzheitlichen Compliance-Richtlinien sind ausschlaggebend, um zukünftige Skandale zu verhindern. Sie tragen dazu bei, das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in den Bankensektor zu stärken. ## Der europäische Kontext und die Rolle der Instant Payments Die Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten der Danske Bank haben die Verflechtungen innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors offengelegt. Es wird deutlich, dass Geldwäsche kein isoliertes Problem einer einzelnen Institution ist. Vielmehr stellt sie ein systemisches Risiko dar, das eine koordinierte Antwort auf europäischer und globaler Ebene erfordert. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die Rolle von Instant Payments zu betrachten. Diese beschleunigen einerseits den Zahlungsverkehr. Andererseits stellen sie neue Herausforderungen für die AML-Compliance dar. Die Integration von effektiven AML-Kontrollen in Instant Payment-Prozesse ist von entscheidender Bedeutung. ## Die Rolle von Technologie und Innovation bei der AML-Compliance Mit dem Aufkommen disruptiver Technologien hat sich die Herangehensweise an das Risikomanagement und die Einhaltung von Compliance-Vorschriften grundlegend gewandelt. Bei der Bekämpfung von Finanzverbrechen wie Geldwäsche avancieren Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und fortschrittliche AML-Technologien zu unverzichtbaren Instrumenten. Sie bieten nicht nur eine deutliche Effizienzsteigerung in den AML-Prozessen, sondern tragen erheblich zur Betrugserkennung und zur Prävention finanzieller Delikte bei. ## Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Geldwäschebekämpfung #### Schweiz In der Schweiz wird die Geldwäscherei durch folgende Gesetze und Verordnungen bekämpft: [Geldwäschereigesetz (GwG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/de): Das für Finanzintermediäre geltende Geldwäschereigesetz regelt die Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei und Terrorismusfinanzierung. Ausserdem regelt es die Sicherstellung der Sorgfalt bei Finanzgeschäften. Geldwäschereiverordnung (GwV): Die Vorschriften für die berufsmässige Ausübung der Tätigkeit als Finanzintermediär werden in dieser Verordnung geregelt. Ebenso sind die Aufsichts- und Meldepflichten für Händlerinnen und Händler darin festgelegt. [Geldwäschereiverordnung-FINMA](https://www.finma.ch/de/ueberwachung/branchenuebergreifende-themen/geldwaeschereibekaempfung/#:~:text=Aufsichtsrechtliche%20Geldw%C3%A4schereibek%C3%A4mpfung,im%20Rahmen%20ihrer%20prudenziellen%20Aufsicht.) (GWV-FINMA): Diese Verordnung legt fest, wie Finanzintermediäre die Pflichten zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umsetzen müssen. #### EU Geldwäscherichtlinie: Die Geldwäscherichtlinie der EU wurde 1991 erlassen und seitdem mehrmals überarbeitet. Die EU-Vorschriften dienen dazu, das Finanzsystem der EU zu schützen. Jedem EU-Mitgliedstaat obliegt es, die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie in nationales Recht umzusetzen. Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche: Im Juli 2021 legte die Europäische Kommission ein Paket mit Gesetzgebungsvorschlägen vor. Diese Vorschläge zielen auf die weitere Stärkung und bessere Durchsetzung der EU-Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AML/CFT) ab. Das Paket sieht vor, eine EU-Behörde zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche zu errichten, die einen Regelungsrahmen für Kredit- und Finanzinstitute schaffen soll. Ausserdem enthält das Paket Verordnungen über Verpflichtungen des privaten Sektors und eine überarbeitete Verordnung über Geldtransfers. #### Deutschland Geldwäschegesetz (GwG): Das deutsche Geldwäschegesetz ist die rechtliche Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinie von 2015 und zielt auf eine wirksame strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Geldwäschern ab. Es wurde mehrmals überarbeitet und ist in der aktuellen Fassung seit dem 02.07.2023 in Kraft. Strafgesetzbuch (StGB): Laut § 261 des deutschen StGB ist „Geldwäsche“ in Deutschland strafbewehrt. Personen, die unrechtmässig erworbene Vermögenswerte verschleiern, nutzen oder verbringen, machen sich strafbar. #### **Die Rolle von Aufsichtsbehörden** Aufsichtsbehörden wie die Schweizer Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FINMA) spielen bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei in der Schweiz eine zentrale Rolle. Ähnlich ist es mit der deutschen Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), die in Deutschland eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche einnimmt. Ihnen obliegt die Überwachung der Einhaltung der Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche bei Banken, Wertpapierhäusern und weiteren Finanzinstituten. Unabhängige Vermögensverwalter und Trustees werden in der Schweiz über die Aufsichtsbehörde (AO) indirekt überwacht. Daneben existieren hier Selbstregulierungsorganisationen (SRO), denen sich nicht prudentiell überwachte Finanzdienstleister anschliessen müssen. Die SROs werden wiederum von der FINMA genehmigt und beaufsichtigt. In Deutschland verfolgt die BaFin ebenfalls einen präventiven Ansatz zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Der Aufsichtsbehörde BaFin steht das im Oktober 2023 gegründete Bundesamt zur Bekämpfung von Finanzmarkt-Kriminalität (BBF) als Bundesoberbehörde zur Seite. In ihm werden Aufsicht, Analyse und strafrechtliche Ermittlung in Sachen Geldwäsche gebündelt. Die automatisierte Funktionalität dieses Tools bietet eine zeit- und ressourcenschonende Möglichkeit zur Risikoidentifizierung. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht es dem Compliance-Team, sich verstärkt auf das strategische Fallmanagement zu fokussieren. Diese Optimierung des Arbeitsablaufs gewährleistet eine effiziente Nutzung relevanter Ressourcen und Unternehmen halten gleichzeitig höchste Standards in Bezug auf Compliance und Risikoprävention aufrecht. ## Zukünftige Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung Die zunehmende Digitalisierung, wachsende globale Geldströme und Kryptowährungen stellen Anti-Money Laundering vor neue Herausforderungen. Da sich Geldwäsche als globales Problem darstellt, erfordert dies nicht nur eine Anpassung bestehender Kontrollmechanismen, sondern mehr internationale Zusammenarbeit. Neben der laufenden Anpassung von Gesetzen und Vorschriften gilt es, diese über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu harmonisieren. Um die Zusammenarbeit auf internationaler Ebene zu verstärken. Dies ist notwendig, weil die Methoden von Kriminellen raffinierter werden. Inzwischen setzen sie Kryptowährungen für Geldwäsche ein. Grosse Hoffnungen verbinden Behörden und Fahnder mit dem Einsatz neuer Methoden wie der Künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und Machine Learning bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung. Bei der Betrugserkennung und Aufdeckung von Anomalien bei Finanztransaktionen werden die neuen Technologien eine wichtige Rolle spielen. ## Fazit Die unheilvolle Geschichte des Danske Bank Skandals hat eine schockierende Wahrheit über den Bankensektor aufgedeckt. Sie hat aufgezeigt, welche gravierenden Konsequenzen mangelnde AML-Compliance nach sich zieht. Aus dieser Geldwäsche-Affäre sind zahlreiche Lektionen gezogen worden. Diese Lektionen betonen die Bedeutung von umfassenden Kontrollmechanismen und transparenten Finanzströmen. Banken stehen vor der Herausforderung, nicht bloss als Reaktion auf Skandale zu handeln. Vielmehr müssen sie als proaktives Element im Kampf gegen kriminelle Finanzaktivitäten agieren. Die Zukunft der AML-Compliance wird zunehmend von digitalen Innovationen und der Integration fortschrittlicher Technologien geprägt sein. Dies erfordert Investitionen in intelligente Lösungen, welche in der Lage sind, auch die raffiniertesten Verdachtsmomente zu identifizieren und zu analysieren. Das Streben nach einer lückenlosen Compliance-Kultur erzeugt eine steigende Nachfrage nach Fachkräften. Diese Fachkräfte müssen sowohl in der Analyse grosser Datenmengen geschult sein, als auch verstärkt in Beziehungsarbeit und Due-Diligence-Prüfung. In Anbetracht der Ereignisse rund um die Danske Bank ist die Notwendigkeit von dynamischen, anpassungsfähigen und international abgestimmten AML-Richtlinien offensichtlich. Die Wegbereiter für eine sichere Bankenwelt im 21. Jahrhundert sind Institute, die Transparenz und Integrität als Teil ihrer Unternehmensphilosophie betrachten. Sie sehen diese Werte nicht nur als gesetzliche Anforderung. Das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit kann durch das kollektive Bemühen aller Beteiligten wiederhergestellt werden. Gemeinsam kann der Sektor zukunftssichere Strukturen schaffen. Diese Strukturen müssen widerstandsfähig gegenüber den Bedrohungen durch Finanzkriminalität sein. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening als Lösung Das Pythagoras [Transaction Screening](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-screening/?hsLang=de) Modul ist die optimale Lösung für die Prüfung ein- und ausgehender Zahlungen.

Für Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, die Feinheiten zu verstehen. ### Definition und Grundlagen der Geldwäsche Geldwäsche ist der Prozess, bei dem illegal erzielte Erlöse als legal erscheinen. Es ist eine Methode, die von Kriminellen verwendet wird, um ihre Aktivitäten und das damit verbundene Geld zu verschleiern und die Erträge aus ihren Verbrechen legitim erscheinen zu lassen. Dies wird oft durch eine komplexe Abfolge von Banküberweisungen oder kommerziellen Transaktionen erreicht, was die Rückverfolgung der ursprünglichen Geldquelle schwierig macht. Einige gut dokumentierte Beispiele für Geldwäsche sind die Verwendung von Bargeld für den Kauf von Lebensversicherungspolicen und deren anschließendes Verfallenlassen, der Kauf und Verkauf wertvoller Vermögenswerte wie Kunst und die Verwendung von [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) zur Verschleierung des Eigentums und des Transfers von Geldern, insbesondere im Immobiliensektor. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen bei [der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"handelsbasierte Geldwäsche\") und der Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen (MSBs) sind ebenfalls gängige Methoden zur Geldwäsche. ### Die Phasen der Geldwäsche Das Verständnis der [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) ist entscheidend, um diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Diese Phasen umfassen in der Regel die Platzierung, das Layering und die Integration. **Platzierung**: Dies ist der Prozess der Einführung des illegalen Geldes in das Finanzsystem. Dies kann durch die Aufteilung großer Bargeldbeträge in weniger auffällige kleinere Summen geschehen, die dann direkt auf ein Bankkonto eingezahlt werden, oder durch den Kauf einer Reihe von Instrumenten (wie Schecks oder Zahlungsanweisungen), die dann gesammelt und auf Konten an einem anderen Ort eingezahlt werden. **Schichtung**: In dieser Phase führt der Geldwäscher in der Regel eine Reihe von Umrechnungen oder Bewegungen der Gelder durch, um sie von ihrer Quelle zu entfernen. Das Layering kann aus mehreren Bank-zu-Bank-Überweisungen, Überweisungen zwischen verschiedenen Konten mit unterschiedlichen Namen in verschiedenen Ländern, Ein- und Auszahlungen bestehen, um den Geldbetrag auf den Konten kontinuierlich zu ändern, die Währung des Geldes zu ändern und hochwertige Gegenstände (wie Häuser oder Unternehmen) zu kaufen, um die Form des Geldes zu ändern. Dies wird manchmal als [komplexe Schichtung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) bezeichnet. **Integration**: Die letzte Phase des Prozesses. In der [Integrationsphase](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) gelangt das Geld in legitim aussehender Form wieder in die Mainstream-Ökonomie – es scheint aus einem legalen Geschäft zu stammen. Dabei kann es sich um eine abschließende Überweisung auf das Konto eines lokalen Unternehmens handeln, in das der Geldwäscher im Austausch für eine Gewinnkürzung „investiert“, um den Verkauf einer Immobilie, die während der Schichtungsphase gekauft wurde, oder einfach um die Ausgabe von Geld, das für Luxusgüter gewaschen wurde. Durch das Verständnis der Grundlagen der Geldwäsche und ihrer Phasen können sich Fachleute besser darauf vorbereiten, diese Aktivitäten zu erkennen und zu verhindern, die entscheidende Aspekte der [Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind. ## Ein Blick auf Beispiele aus dem wirklichen Leben Um die Dynamik der Geldwäsche besser zu verstehen, schauen wir uns Beispiele aus der Praxis an. Diese Fälle, in denen es um Lebensversicherungen, die Kunstwelt und Briefkastenfirmen im Immobilienbereich geht, enthüllen die komplizierten Strategien, mit denen illegale Gelder verschleiert werden. ### Geldwäsche durch Lebensversicherung Eine Methode der Geldwäsche sind Lebensversicherungen. Einzelpersonen verwenden Bargeld, um diese Policen zu kaufen, dann Kredite gegen sie aufzunehmen und schließlich die Policen verfallen zu lassen. Diese zirkuläre Methode verschleiert die Herkunft der Gelder und verleiht dem illegalen Bargeld einen Anstrich von Legitimität ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dieses Beispiel unterstreicht die Bedeutung von [Know-Your-Customer- (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) und [Kunden-Due-Diligence-Verfahren](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) im Versicherungssektor als Schlüsselkomponenten der [Anti-Geldwäsche-Compliance](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/). ### Geldwäsche in der Kunstwelt Die Kunstwelt ist ein weiterer Bereich, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Kriminelle kaufen und verkaufen wertvolle Kunstwerke, um die Herkunft des bei diesen Transaktionen verwendeten Bargelds zu verschleiern. Der hohe Wert von Kunstwerken, gepaart mit der subjektiven Natur ihrer Preisgestaltung, macht dies zu einem fruchtbaren Boden für Geldwäschesysteme. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit strenger Kontrollen und Transparenz bei hochwertigen Kunsttransaktionen. ### Briefkastenfirmen und Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen, insbesondere solche, an [denen Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) beteiligt sind, sind ein weiterer häufiger Kanal für Geldwäsche. Kriminelle kaufen Immobilien oft mit Bargeld und verschleiern ihr Eigentum durch Briefkastenfirmen oder versteckten Immobilienbesitz, um die Spur der Gelder zu verwischen und die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft zu erschweren ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). In einigen Fällen werden Immobilienbewertungen manipuliert, und Kriminelle arbeiten mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese illegale Praxis ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. In einem bemerkenswerten Fall hat ein Mann aus Honduras über 1 Million US-Dollar an Bestechungsgeldern durch internationale Überweisungen gewaschen, um Immobilien in New Orleans zu kaufen, darunter auch Büroräume ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). In einem anderen Fall soll eine Privatbank einem Konto des Vatikans erlaubt haben, 350 Millionen Dollar für Investitionen in Londoner Immobilien auszugeben und damit illegale Immobilientransaktionen zu erleichtern, darunter auch solche von Drogenhändlern, um Immobilien in Bulgarien zu kaufen ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, wie wichtig die Transparenz der [wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) bei Immobilientransaktionen ist und wie wichtig strenge Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in diesem Sektor sind. Sie heben auch die Herausforderungen hervor, mit denen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden bei der Verfolgung des Flusses illegaler Gelder konfrontiert sind, und die zentrale Rolle des [Offshore-Bankwesens](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) bei Geldwäschesystemen. ## Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche ist eine komplexe Form der Finanzkriminalität, bei der Handelstransaktionen genutzt werden, um illegal verdientes Geld zu verstecken, zu bewegen und zu investieren. Es ist neben Layering und Integration eine der drei grundlegenden Methoden der Geldwäsche, die alle in unserem Artikel über die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) untersucht werden können. ### Falsche Darstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen Bei handelsbasierter Geldwäsche werden der Preis, die Menge oder die Qualität von Waren oder Dienstleistungen falsch dargestellt, um Werte zwischen Ländern zu transferieren und die illegale Geldquelle zu verbergen ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Diese Methode kann sowohl in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) verwendet werden, um komplexe Transaktionsschichten zu erstellen, als auch in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) , um das gewaschene Geld wieder in die legale Wirtschaft einzuführen. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen kann verschiedene Formen annehmen, wie z. B. Überfakturierung, Unterfakturierung, Mehrfachrechnungsstellung oder falsche Beschreibung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen. Diese betrügerischen Praktiken werden häufig durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) und verschleierte [wirtschaftliche Eigentümerstrukturen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) erleichtert, was es den Behörden erschweren kann, diese Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu untersuchen. ### Fallstudien zur handelsbasierten Geldwäsche Ein bemerkenswertes Beispiel für handelsbasierte Geldwäsche war eine kriminelle Organisation, die unterbewertete Waren und gefälschte Rechnungen verwendete, um 1,8 Millionen US-Dollar an schmutzigem Geld zu waschen ([UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). In diesem Fall kaufte die Organisation Waren in einem Land zu einem niedrigen Preis und verkaufte sie dann in einem anderen Land zu einem viel höheren Preis. Die Preisdifferenz wurde zur Geldwäsche des Schwarzgeldes verwendet. Dieser Fall erinnert eindringlich daran, wie wichtig robuste Verfahren zur [Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind, einschließlich einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und einer kontinuierlichen Überwachung von Transaktionen. Durch das Verständnis der Techniken, die bei der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche eingesetzt werden, können Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, die mit dieser Art von illegalen Aktivitäten verbundenen Risiken besser erkennen und [mindern](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Minderung der Risiken\") . Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit einer kontinuierlichen Wachsamkeit und wirksamer Kontrollen im globalen Handelssektor. Da sich die von Kriminellen verwendeten Methoden ständig weiterentwickeln, ist es für Unternehmen von entscheidender Bedeutung, auf dem Laufenden zu bleiben und ihre [Strategien zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche\") entsprechend anzupassen. Durch das Verständnis der Taktiken, die bei der Geldwäsche angewendet werden, können Fachleute ihre Organisationen besser schützen und zum globalen Kampf gegen Finanzkriminalität beitragen. ## Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen Money Services Businesses (MSBs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle im globalen Finanzsystem und bieten Dienstleistungen wie Geldtransfer, Währungsumtausch und Scheckeinlösung an. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist jedoch zu einem erheblichen Problem bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche geworden, da diese Unternehmen die Bewegung von Geldern ohne angemessene Prüfung oder behördliche Aufsicht erleichtern können ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Nicht registrierte Geldübermittler Im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche nutzen Kriminelle häufig nicht registrierte Geldübermittler, eine Untergruppe von MSBs, aus, um illegale Gelder zu bewegen, ohne die Aufmerksamkeit der Behörden auf sich zu ziehen ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese nicht registrierten Unternehmen operieren unter dem Radar und umgehen die strengen Vorschriften und [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden,](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) denen traditionelle Finanzinstitute unterliegen. Überweisungen, die über diese nicht registrierten MSBs getätigt werden, hinterlassen möglicherweise keine Aufzeichnungen, was es schwierig macht, die ursprüngliche Quelle oder den endgültigen Bestimmungsort der Gelder zurückzuverfolgen. Dies macht sie zu einem idealen Kanal während der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/), in der das Ziel darin besteht, die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern. Die relative Leichtigkeit und Anonymität, die nicht registrierte Geldübermittler bieten, macht sie attraktiv für Kriminelle, die diese Dienste nutzen, um Geld unentdeckt über Grenzen zu bewegen. Dies ist eine große Herausforderung für [die weltweiten Bemühungen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche.](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) ### Fallstudien zum MSB-Missbrauch Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist leider keine Seltenheit, wobei zahlreiche Fälle auf der ganzen Welt verzeichnet wurden. So ist beispielsweise bekannt, dass Kriminelle MSBs nutzen, um Geld aus illegalen Aktivitäten wie Drogenhandel, Betrug und organisierter Kriminalität zu waschen. In vielen Fällen werden diese illegalen Gelder über nicht registrierte MSBs bewegt, was es für die Behörden schwierig macht, die Transaktionen zu erkennen und zurückzuverfolgen. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie wichtig eine solide regulatorische Aufsicht im Finanzsektor ist. Es unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit effektiver [Know-Your-Customer-Verfahren (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) einer strengen Überwachung von Transaktionen und einer gründlichen Due-Diligence-Prüfung, um einen solchen Missbrauch zu verhindern. Der Kampf gegen Geldwäsche ist kontinuierlich, wobei ständig neue Methoden und Techniken entstehen. Indem sie diese [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/) verstehen und daraus lernen, können sich Aufsichtsbehörden, Compliance-Beauftragte und Finanzinstitute besser darauf vorbereiten, illegale Geldflüsse in Zukunft zu erkennen und zu verhindern. ## Geldwäsche durch Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen bieten Kriminellen eine effektive Möglichkeit, illegale Gelder zu waschen. Die hochwertigen Transaktionen des Sektors in Kombination mit den oft komplexen rechtlichen und finanziellen Vereinbarungen stellen eine attraktive Gelegenheit für Kriminelle dar, die versuchen, ihre unrechtmäßig erworbenen Gewinne zu legitimieren. ### Kauf und Verkauf von Immobilien Eine gängige Methode, die Kriminelle anwenden, besteht darin, Immobilien mit Bargeld zu erwerben und deren Eigentum dann durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) oder verstecktes Eigentum zu verbergen ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Diese Methode verwischt die Spur der Gelder und erschwert die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft, was die Strafverfolgungsbehörden vor Herausforderungen stellt. Eine weitere Strategie ist die Manipulation von Immobilienbewertungen. Kriminelle arbeiten oft mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese Taktik ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. Kriminelle gründen auch Briefkastenfirmen in ausländischen Gerichtsbarkeiten, um Immobilien zu besitzen, was den grenzüberschreitenden Fluss illegaler Gelder erleichtert. Diese Methode erschwert es den Behörden, den Geldfluss zu verfolgen, und zeigt eine Methode, mit der Geldwäscheaktivitäten verschleiert werden. ### Fallstudien zur Geldwäsche im Immobilienbereich Immobiliengeldwäsche ist ein globales Problem. Laut einem Bericht von Global Financial Integrity (GFI) wurden von 2015 bis 2021 mehr als 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar über US-Immobilien gewaschen. Dies unterstreicht, dass Immobilien nach wie vor eine der beliebtesten Möglichkeiten sind, illegale Gelder zu bewegen. Ein weiteres Beispiel: In den letzten zehn Jahren flossen etwa 20 Milliarden US-Dollar in den Immobilienmarkt im Großraum Toronto in Kanada, ohne dass die Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörden eine angemessene Prüfung durchführten ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Region | Gewaschene Menge (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | USA | 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar | | Großraum Toronto, Kanada | 20 Milliarden US-Dollar | Diese Beispiele unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Wachsamkeit und wirksamer [Einhaltung der Geldwäschebekämpfung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) im Immobiliensektor. Wenn sie die Taktiken von Kriminellen verstehen und sich der [Warnsignale](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Rote Fahnen\") bewusst sind, können Fachleute im Immobiliensektor eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Unterbrechung dieser illegalen Finanzströme spielen. Für diejenigen, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, kann das Verständnis dieser [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) helfen, potenzielle Risiken zu identifizieren und effektive [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) zu implementieren. ## Geldwäsche-Skandale Trotz strenger [Compliance-Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) und behördlicher Kontrollen tauchen immer wieder Fälle von Geldwäsche in großem Maßstab auf. Schauen wir uns einige bemerkenswerte Geldwäscheskandale an, die in den letzten Jahren Schlagzeilen gemacht haben. ### Das FinCEN-Dateileck Im Jahr 2020 enthüllte das Durchsickern der FinCEN-Dateien (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) ein riesiges Netzwerk von Finanzkorruption. Über 400 Journalisten aus 88 Ländern arbeiteten an dieser Untersuchung zusammen und deckten verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von erstaunlichen 2 Billionen US-Dollar auf. Diese geheimen Dateien enthielten Informationen über Transaktionen, die von Banken als verdächtig gekennzeichnet wurden, aber fortgesetzt werden durften. Der Bericht hob schwerwiegende Versäumnisse in den globalen Bankensystemen hervor, die es ermöglichten, große Geldsummen ohne angemessene Kontrollen zu bewegen. Das FinCEN-Files-Leck unterstrich die Bedeutung einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der rigorosen Durchsetzung von [Know Your Customer (KYC)-](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) Vorschriften. Der Fall ist eine eindringliche Erinnerung an das potenzielle Ausmaß und die Komplexität von Geldwäscheoperationen. ### Das Panama-Papers-Leak Das Leak der Panama Papers im Jahr 2016 war eine monumentale Enthüllung, die zahlreiche aufsehenerregende Fälle von Geldwäsche, Steuerhinterziehung und Umgehung internationaler Sanktionen enthüllte. Das Leck betraf Banken, Anwaltskanzleien und hochkarätige Einzelpersonen weltweit und enthüllte das Ausmaß illegaler Finanzaktivitäten, die durch [Offshore-Banken](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) und [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) verschleiert wurden. Die Panama Papers hoben den Missbrauch anonymer Briefkastenfirmen hervor, um [wirtschaftliches Eigentum](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/). Infolgedessen führte der Skandal zu Forderungen nach mehr Transparenz bei Offshore-Finanzdienstleistungen und strengeren Vorschriften zur Identifizierung der wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer. ### Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon Der „Troika-Waschsalon“-Skandal umfasste die Geldwäsche von 4,6 Milliarden US-Dollar über ein Netzwerk von Scheinfirmen und illegale Finanztransaktionen zwischen 2006 und 2013. An diesem System waren mehrere Parteien in verschiedenen Gerichtsbarkeiten beteiligt, was die globale Reichweite von Geldwäscheoperationen zeigt. Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon brachte den Missbrauch von Briefkastenfirmen ans Licht, um die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/). Der Skandal führte zu Ermittlungen und rechtlichen Schritten, was die Bedeutung der globalen Zusammenarbeit bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche weiter unterstreicht. Jeder dieser Skandale unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche und die anhaltende Notwendigkeit von Wachsamkeit und Durchsetzung. Durch die Untersuchung dieser „Geldwäschebeispiele“ können Fachleute in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität ein tieferes Verständnis für die von Geldwäschern angewandten Taktiken erlangen und erfahren, wie diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufgedeckt und verhindert werden können. ## Aus Geldwäschefällen lernen Das Verständnis realer Szenarien ist eine der effektivsten Möglichkeiten, den komplexen Prozess der Geldwäsche zu verstehen. Dieser Abschnitt wirft einen genaueren Blick auf einige der bedeutendsten Geldwäschebeispiele der jüngeren Geschichte, um wertvolle Einblicke in den Ablauf dieser Ereignisse und die daraus gezogenen Lehren zu geben. ### Der Fall Wachovia Bank Im Jahr 2010 war die Wachovia Bank in eine umfangreiche Geldwäscheoperation verwickelt, an der mexikanische Drogenkartelle beteiligt waren. Zwischen 2004 und 2007 ermöglichte die Bank über ihre Filialen die Geldwäsche von fast 390 Milliarden US-Dollar. Die illegalen Gelder, die aus dem Drogenhandel in den USA stammten, wurden über die mexikanische Grenze geschmuggelt und später auf die US-Konten von Wachovia zurücküberwiesen. Die Bank hat es versäumt, die Herkunft dieser Gelder zu überprüfen und ist damit ihren [Know Your Customer (KYC)-Verpflichtungen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) nicht nachgekommen. Anstelle einer Strafverfolgung zahlte Wachovia eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 160 Millionen US-Dollar und versprach, seine [Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche (AML)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verbessern. ### Der Standardfall der Chartered Bank Die Standard Chartered Bank wurde wegen wiederholter Verstöße gegen US-Sanktionen mit hohen Strafen belegt. Nachdem die Bank 2012 zunächst mit einer Geldstrafe von 670 Millionen US-Dollar wegen Verstößen gegen den Iran belegt worden war, wurde sie 2019 erneut beschuldigt, Sanktionen gegen Länder wie Simbabwe, Burma, Iran, Sudan, Kuba und Syrien ignoriert zu haben. Für diese Verstöße verhängten die US-amerikanischen und britischen Behörden eine Geldstrafe von insgesamt 1,1 Milliarden US-Dollar gegen Standard Chartered und unterstrichen damit die schwerwiegenden Folgen einer Missachtung des Völkerrechts. ### Der Fall Danske Bank Die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank diente zwischen 2007 und 2015 als Kanal für geschätzte 228 Milliarden US-Dollar an gewaschenen Geldern. Dieser Skandal, in den Tausende von verdächtigen Kunden verwickelt waren, lenkte die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit auf die Compliance-Versäumnisse der Bank. Die dänischen Behörden verhängten Geldstrafen in Höhe von insgesamt 2 Millionen US-Dollar und wiesen mehreren Managern der Bank die Schuld zu. ### Der Fall BCCI Die Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) war an Betrugs [– und Geldwäscheaktivitäten](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) in Höhe von insgesamt bis zu 23 Milliarden US-Dollar beteiligt. Die BCCI nutzte ausgeklügelte Geldwäschesysteme wie [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/), Datenschutzoasen, Provisionen und Bestechung. Die Schließung der Bank im Jahr 1991 führte zu zahlreichen rechtlichen Schritten, darunter die Klage der BCCI gegen die Bank of England wegen Nachlässigkeit bei der Identifizierung von Frühwarnzeichen. Dieser Fall unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster AML-Compliance-Programme ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche unterstreichen die Bedeutung strenger AML-Verfahren, einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der Notwendigkeit, die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) zu verstehen, um Finanzkriminalität aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Indem sie aus diesen Fällen lernen, können Fachleute im Bereich Compliance und Risikomanagement ihre Unternehmen besser auf ähnliche Situationen vorbereiten und schützen.

The AMLA requires FinCEN to pay an award of [**up to 30 percent of collected monetary sanctions**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/money_laundering_whistleblower_reward/) that it recovers in a judicial or administrative action brought under the Bank Secrecy Act that results in sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The SEC can also **[pay awards to whistleblowers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/sec-whistleblower-program/)** for disclosing a broker-dealer’s failure to file [suspicious activity reports](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/report_reference.pdf), maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program, or establish an adequate customer identification program. In addition, the SEC can take an enforcement action against a mutual fund for a violation of Rule 38a-1, which requires investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws by the funds, which includes the Bank Secrecy Act.

In December 2022, [Danske Bank agreed to pay $413 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-220) to settle charges that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading investors about its AML compliance program in its Estonian branch and failing to disclose the risks posed by the program’s significant deficiencies. Danske Bank has agreed to pay more than $2 billion as part of an integrated, global resolution with the SEC, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Denmark’s Special Crime Unit. And in February 2018, [U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank paid $613 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/u-s-bancorp-agrees-to-pay-528-million-over-money-laundering) in fines and forfeitures to settle charges that it failed to maintain adequate safeguards against money laundering. In particular, U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious and processed Western Union transactions for non-customers. ## **SEC and FINRA Continue to Prioritize Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** The SEC’s [2024 examination priorities](https://www.sec.gov/files/2024-exam-priorities.pdf) clarify that the SEC continues to focus on AML compliance: > The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies, to establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs that are tailored to address the risks associated with the firm’s location, size, and activities, including the customers they serve, the types of products and services offered, and how those products and services are offered. These programs must, among other things, include policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the BSA and its implementing rules; independent testing; and risk-based procedures to perform customer due diligence (as required by the Customer Due Diligence rule), which includes identifying and verifying the identity of customers and conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. Where appropriate, certain financial institutions must also file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. SARs can be used to detect and combat market manipulation, insider trading, Ponzi schemes, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and a variety of other illicit activities potentially violative of securities and other laws and regulations. > > **The Division will continue to focus on AML programs to review whether broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies are: (1) appropriately tailoring their AML program to their business model and associated AML risks; (2) conducting independent testing; (3) establishing an adequate customer identification program, including for beneficial owners of legal entity customers; and (4) meeting their SAR filing obligations.** > **Examinations of certain registered investment companies will also review policies and procedures for oversight of applicable financial intermediaries. Also, the Division will review whether broker-dealers and advisers are monitoring** **Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and ensuring compliance with such sanctions.** # **Broker-Dealer Anti-Money Laundering Requirements** The primary [anti-money laundering regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.210) for brokers or dealers require, among other things, the establishment and implementation of an anti-money laundering program, which includes, at a minimum: * Policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance; * Independent testing for compliance; * Monitoring of the operations and internal controls of the program; * Ongoing training for appropriate persons; and * Appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, which includes: + Establishing, documenting, and maintaining a written [Customer Identification Program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.220); and + Continuous monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. In the event that a broker-dealer identifies a suspicious transaction, the firm is [required to file a SAR](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.320) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In the SAR’s narrative section, broker-dealers must “[p]rovide a clear, complete and chronological description . . . of the activity, including what is unusual, irregular or suspicious about the transactions(s).” Broker-dealers violate federal securities laws (specifically, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8) when they: * Fail to file SARs; or * File inaccurate SARs (e.g., incomplete narratives, incomplete critical field information, incomplete identification of suspicious activity, etc.). These violations deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information that could be used to identify potential securities law and money laundering violations. # **SEC and FINRA AML Enforcement Actions** * In September 2023, the SEC iharged registered investment adviser DWS Investment Management Americas Inc. (DIMA or DWS), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, for its failure to develop a mutual fund Anti-Money Laundering program. To settle the charges, DIMA agreed to pay a total of [$25 million in penalties](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-194). The SEC’s [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/ia-6431.pdf) also found that DIMA caused such mutual funds’ failure to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect activities indicative of money laundering and to conduct AML training specific to the mutual funds’ business. * In September 2023, the SEC charged a registered representative at a registered broker-dealer with [failing to report suspicious and unusual transactions in a brokerage account](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-98418-s) of his long-time customer to the AML group of the brokerage firm where he worked, which caused the firm to fail to timely file a SAR in violation of the federal securities laws. * In May 2016, FINRA fined Raymond James & Associates and Raymond James Financial Services **[$17 million](https://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/finra-fines-raymond-james-us17m-206217)** for widespread violations related to their anti-money laundering programs. The violations stemmed from the firms’ failure to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering programs, which in turn precluded the firms from meeting their duty to prevent, detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity from at least November 2011 through June 2014. * In December 2016, FINRA fined Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC [**$16.5 million**](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/CreditSuisse_AWC_120516.pdf?utm_source=MM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NewsRelease_120516_FINAL) for “significant deficiencies” in its anti-money laundering program. According to FINRA, Credit Suisse’s program failed to effectively monitor/detect suspicious trading and money movements from at least January 2011 through December 2015. As a result, Credit Suisse was unable to determine whether to file required SARs. * In January 2015, Oppenheimer & Company paid [**$10 million**](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/33-9711.pdf) to settle an action by the SEC and FinCEN for failure to file SARs. According to the SEC’s complaint, Oppenheimer’s anti-money laundering program identified suspicious activity that needed to be “escalated” immediately. Specifically, the activity stemmed from an account that: “(i) was a foreign broker-dealer doing business in the U.S.; (ii) selling ‘low-priced stock’ on behalf of customers; and (iii) that it immediately wired the proceeds out of the Oppenheimer account.” Despite these and other red flags, Oppenheimer failed to file SARs with FinCEN. * In February 2016, the SEC fined E.S. Financial Services [**$1 million**](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-23.html) for violating anti-money laundering laws by “allowing foreign entities to buy and sell securities without verifying the identities of the non-U.S. citizens who beneficially owned them.” As mentioned, federal securities laws require broker-dealers to establish, document, and maintain a written Customer Identification Program. ## **SEC AML Enforcement** In a July 2023 Risk Alert, EXAMS staff observed certain weaknesses in OFAC compliance programs, including instances in which entities did not adopt or implement reasonable, risk-based internal controls for 1. following-up on potential matches with the sanctions lists and documenting the outcome of such follow-up; 2. performing periodic or event-based screening of existing clients or customers based on, among other things, changes in ownership or to the sanctions lists; and 3. conducting OFAC searches in a timely manner (or documenting that such searches were completed). The alert encourages registrants to review and strengthen the policies, procedures, and internal controls of their AML programs to further their compliance with federal AML rules and regulations, and to monitor for amendments, pursuant to the AMLA and the Corporate Transparency Act.

According to the SEC’s [complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-112.pdf), Alpine failed to adequately file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for at least 1,950 stock transactions that the firm flagged as suspicious. The SEC found that Alpine’s “records contained information reflecting material red flags of money laundering, securities fraud, or other illicit financial activities relating to its customers and their transactions,” and that Alpine “routinely and systematically failed to identify and report suspicious activity in its SAR filings.” The SEC charged Alpine with thousands of violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8, and sought an order requiring Alpine to pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, which provides for penalties ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 for each violation The SEC’s complaint reveals that the SEC also charged many of Alpine’s customers with federal securities laws violations, including violations relating to transactions that cleared through Alpine. ## **SEC Whistleblower Program Pays More than $1.8 Billion in Awards to Whistleblowers** In 2010, Congress created the [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) to “motivate those with inside knowledge to come forward and assist the Government to identify and prosecute persons who have violated securities laws and recover money for victims of financial fraud,” S.

About Battle Over Corporate Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/whistleblower-attorney-jason-zuckerman-quoted-battle-corporate-whistleblower-rules/) In 2020, the SEC announced that “Anti-Money Laundering” was on the agency’s [List of Examination Priorities](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/national-examination-program-priorities-2020.pdf). The SEC’s examination priorities “reflect certain practices, products, and services that [SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations] perceives to present potentially heightened risk to investors and/or the integrity of the U.S. capital markets.” In the priority list, the SEC clarifies that it will continue to scrutinize broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs by: * Examining the appropriateness and effectiveness of broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs; * Reviewing how broker-dealers are monitoring for suspicious activity; and * Assessing broker-dealers’ compliance with SAR requirements. In 2016, the SEC [announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/inside-the-national-exam-program-in-2016.html) that it would share more of its oversight responsibilities of the broker-dealer industry with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Since 2017, and in lockstep with the SEC, FINRA included “Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity Monitoring” on its [2020 Annual Regulatory and Examination Priorities Letter](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/communications-firms/2020-risk-monitoring-and-examination-priorities-letter). Both the SEC and FINRA have increased enforcement actions against broker-dealers for anti-money laundering program violations. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)(2) (the “SAR Rule”). Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. Id. Exchange Act Rule 17a-8 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission to comply with the reporting, record-keeping, and record retention requirements of the BSA. The failure to timely file a SAR as required by the SAR Rule is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act. * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=linkedin) * [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=twitter) * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=facebook) * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=tumblr) Categories: [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-program/), [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Protection Law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-protection-law/), [Money Laundering Whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [SEC Whistleblower Attorney](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-attorney/), [SEC Whistleblower Award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower cases](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-cases/), [SEC whistleblower lawyers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/), [SEC Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-program/), [SEC Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-rules/), [Uncategorized](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/uncategorized/), [Whistleblower Bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounties/), [whistleblower bounty](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounty/), [Whistleblower Rewards](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-rewards/) Tags: [AML compliance whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-compliance-whistleblower/), [AML whistleblower lawyer](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-whistleblower-lawyer/), [AMLA whistleblower law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/amla-whistleblower-law/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-bounties/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower reward program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-reward-program/), [anti-money laundering whistleblowing](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblowing/), [broker dealer fraud whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/broker-dealer-fraud-whistleblower/), [money laundering whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [reporting money laundering to SEC](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/reporting-money-laundering-to-sec/), [sec whistleblower award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-program/), [sec whistleblower rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-rules/) ### About the authors Matthew Stock is the Director of the Whistleblower Rewards Practice at Zuckerman Law.

Il est essentiel que les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière en comprennent les subtilités. ### Définition et principes de base du blanchiment d’argent Le blanchiment d’argent est le processus qui consiste à faire paraître légal le produit de l’argent illégal. Il s’agit d’une méthode utilisée par les criminels pour dissimuler leurs activités et l’argent en jeu, en faisant apparaître le produit de leurs crimes comme légitime. Cela se fait souvent par le biais d’une séquence complexe de virements bancaires ou de transactions commerciales, ce qui rend difficile le traçage de la source d’origine des fonds. Parmi les exemples bien documentés de blanchiment d’argent, citons l’utilisation d’espèces pour acheter des polices d’assurance-vie et les laisser ensuite expirer, l’achat et la vente d’actifs de valeur comme des œuvres d’art, et l’utilisation de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) pour dissimuler la propriété et le transfert de fonds, en particulier dans le secteur immobilier. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services dans le [cadre du blanchiment d’argent axé sur le commerce](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce\") et l’utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) sont également des méthodes courantes utilisées pour blanchir de l’argent. ### Les étapes du blanchiment d’argent Comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) est crucial pour détecter et prévenir cette activité illicite. Ces étapes comprennent généralement le placement, la superposition et l’intégration. **Placement** : Il s’agit du processus d’introduction de l’argent illicite dans le système financier. Cela peut être fait en divisant de grandes quantités d’argent en petites sommes moins visibles qui sont ensuite déposées directement dans un compte bancaire, ou en achetant une série d’instruments (tels que des chèques ou des mandats) qui sont ensuite collectés et déposés dans des comptes à un autre endroit. **Superposition** : À ce stade, le blanchisseur d’argent s’engage généralement dans une série de conversions ou de mouvements des fonds pour les éloigner de leur source. La superposition peut consister en plusieurs virements bancaires, des virements bancaires entre différents comptes à des noms différents dans différents pays, des dépôts et des retraits pour faire varier continuellement le montant d’argent sur les comptes, changer la devise de l’argent et acheter des articles de grande valeur (tels que des maisons ou des entreprises) pour changer la forme de l’argent. C’est ce qu’on appelle parfois [la superposition complexe](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). **Intégration** : La dernière étape du processus. Au [stade de l’intégration](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/), l’argent réintègre l’économie traditionnelle sous une forme d’apparence légitime – il semble provenir d’une transaction légale. Il peut s’agir d’un virement bancaire final sur le compte d’une entreprise locale dans laquelle le blanchisseur « investit » en échange d’une part des bénéfices, de la vente d’une propriété achetée pendant la phase de superposition ou simplement de la dépense d’argent qui a été blanchi pour des produits de luxe. En comprenant les bases du blanchiment d’argent et ses étapes, les professionnels peuvent mieux s’outiller pour détecter et prévenir ces activités, qui sont des aspects cruciaux de la [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ## Regarder des exemples concrets Pour mieux comprendre la dynamique du blanchiment d’argent, penchons-nous sur des exemples concrets. Ces affaires, impliquant l’assurance-vie, le monde de l’art et les sociétés écrans dans l’immobilier, dévoilent les stratégies complexes employées pour dissimuler des fonds illicites. ### Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’assurance-vie L’une des méthodes de blanchiment d’argent consiste à souscrire des polices d’assurance-vie. Les particuliers utilisent de l’argent comptant pour acheter ces polices, puis empruntent sur celles-ci et finissent par laisser les polices expirer. Cette méthode circulaire obscurcit l’origine des fonds et donne un vernis de légitimité à l’argent illicite ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Cet exemple souligne l’importance des procédures de [connaissance du client (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) et de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle dans le secteur de l’assurance en tant qu’éléments clés de [la conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ### Le blanchiment d’argent dans le monde de l’art Le monde de l’art est un autre domaine vulnérable au blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent et vendent des œuvres d’art de valeur pour masquer l’origine de l’argent utilisé dans ces transactions. La valeur élevée des œuvres d’art, associée à la nature subjective de leur prix, en fait un terrain fertile pour les stratagèmes de blanchiment d’argent. Cela met en évidence la nécessité de contrôles rigoureux et de transparence dans les transactions d’œuvres d’art de grande valeur. ### Sociétés fictives et biens immobiliers Les transactions immobilières, en particulier celles impliquant [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), sont un autre canal courant de blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent souvent des biens immobiliers en utilisant de l’argent comptant et dissimulent leur propriété par le biais de sociétés fictives ou de propriétés cachées afin d’obscurcir la piste des fonds et de compliquer la recherche de leurs origines illicites ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dans certains cas, les évaluations immobilières sont manipulées et les criminels collaborent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette pratique illicite leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Dans un cas notable, un Hondurien a blanchi plus d’un million de dollars de pots-de-vin par virement bancaire international pour acheter des propriétés à la Nouvelle-Orléans, y compris des espaces de bureaux ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Dans un autre cas, une banque privée aurait permis à un compte appartenant au Vatican de dépenser 350 millions de dollars pour investir dans l’immobilier londonien, facilitant ainsi les transactions immobilières illégales, y compris celles effectuées par des trafiquants de drogue pour acheter des propriétés en Bulgarie ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Ces exemples illustrent l’importance de la transparence des [bénéficiaires effectifs](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans les transactions immobilières et la nécessité de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur. Ils soulignent également les défis auxquels sont confrontés les organismes chargés de l’application de la loi pour retracer les flux de fonds illicites et le rôle central des [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) dans les systèmes de blanchiment d’argent. ## Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce est une forme complexe de criminalité financière qui utilise des transactions commerciales pour cacher, déplacer et investir de l’argent gagné illicitement. C’est l’une des trois méthodes fondamentales de blanchiment d’argent, avec la superposition et l’intégration, qui peuvent toutes être explorées dans notre article sur les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/). ### Fausse déclaration de biens ou de services Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce consiste à faire de fausses déclarations sur le prix, la quantité ou la qualité de biens ou de services afin de transférer de la valeur entre les pays et de dissimuler la source illicite des fonds ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Cette méthode peut être utilisée à la fois à [l’étape de la stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour créer des couches complexes de transactions et à [l’étape d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour réintroduire l’argent blanchi dans l’économie légitime. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services peut prendre plusieurs formes, telles que la surfacturation, la sous-facturation, la facturation multiple ou la description mensongère de biens ou de services. Ces pratiques frauduleuses sont souvent facilitées par [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) et des structures de [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dissimulées, ce qui peut rendre difficile pour les autorités de détecter ces activités et d’enquêter sur celles-ci. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent lié au commerce Un exemple notable de blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce concerne une organisation criminelle qui utilise des biens sous-évalués et de fausses factures pour blanchir 1,8 million de dollars d’argent sale ([ONUDC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). Dans ce cas, l’organisation a acheté des biens dans un pays à bas prix, puis les a vendus dans un autre pays à un prix beaucoup plus élevé. La différence de prix a été utilisée pour blanchir l’argent illicite. Cette affaire nous rappelle brutalement l’importance de solides procédures de [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) , y compris une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard de la clientèle et une surveillance continue des transactions. En comprenant les techniques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce, les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux identifier et [atténuer les risques](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Atténuer les risques\") associés à ce type d’activité illicite. Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent mettent en évidence la nécessité d’une vigilance continue et de contrôles efficaces dans le secteur du commerce mondial. Alors que les méthodes utilisées par les criminels continuent d’évoluer, il est crucial pour les organisations de rester informées et d’adapter leurs stratégies [de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent\") en conséquence. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent, les professionnels peuvent mieux protéger leurs organisations et contribuer à la lutte mondiale contre la criminalité financière. ## Utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires Les entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) jouent un rôle crucial dans le système financier mondial, offrant des services tels que le transfert d’argent, le change de devises et l’encaissement de chèques. Cependant, l’utilisation abusive des ESM est devenue une préoccupation importante dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, car ces entreprises peuvent faciliter le mouvement de fonds sans examen ou surveillance réglementaire appropriés ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Transmetteurs d’argent non enregistrés Dans le contexte du blanchiment d’argent, les criminels exploitent souvent des émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés, un sous-ensemble d’ESM, pour transférer des fonds illicites sans attirer l’attention des autorités ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces entités non enregistrées opèrent sous le radar, contournant les réglementations strictes et les procédures de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle auxquelles les institutions financières traditionnelles sont soumises. Les transferts effectués par l’intermédiaire de ces ESM non inscrites peuvent ne pas laisser de traces, ce qui rend difficile la reconstitution de la source d’origine ou de la destination finale des fonds. Cela en fait un canal idéal pendant la [phase de stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/), où l’objectif est de dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites. La relative facilité et l’anonymat offerts par les émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés les rendent attrayants pour les criminels, qui utilisent ces services pour transférer de l’argent au-delà des frontières sans être détectés. Il s’agit d’un défi de taille pour les efforts [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le monde entier. ### Études de cas d’utilisation abusive d’ESM L’utilisation abusive des ESM n’est malheureusement pas rare, avec de nombreux cas enregistrés à travers le monde. Par exemple, les criminels sont connus pour utiliser les ESM pour blanchir de l’argent provenant d’activités illégales telles que le trafic de drogue, la fraude et le crime organisé. Dans de nombreux cas, ces fonds illicites transitent par des ESM non enregistrées, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de détecter et de retracer les transactions. L’utilisation abusive des ESM est un rappel brutal de l’importance d’une surveillance réglementaire rigoureuse dans le secteur financier. Il souligne la nécessité de mettre en place des procédures efficaces de [connaissance du client (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) un suivi rigoureux des transactions et une diligence raisonnable approfondie pour prévenir de tels abus. La lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent est continue, avec de nouvelles méthodes et techniques qui émergent constamment. En comprenant et en tirant des leçons de ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/), les organismes de réglementation, les responsables de la conformité et les institutions financières peuvent mieux s’équiper pour détecter et prévenir les flux d’argent illicites à l’avenir. ## Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’immobilier Les transactions immobilières offrent aux criminels un moyen efficace de blanchir des fonds illicites. Les transactions de grande valeur du secteur, combinées aux montages juridiques et financiers souvent complexes qu’elles impliquent, représentent une opportunité intéressante pour les criminels qui cherchent à légitimer leurs gains mal acquis. ### Achat et vente d’une propriété Une méthode courante employée par les criminels consiste à acheter des biens immobiliers en espèces, puis à dissimuler leur propriété par le biais de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) ou de propriétés cachées ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Cette méthode obscurcit la piste des fonds et complique la recherche de leurs origines illicites, ce qui pose des défis aux organismes d’application de la loi. Une autre stratégie consiste à manipuler les évaluations immobilières. Les criminels collaborent souvent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette tactique leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Les criminels établissent également des sociétés fictives dans des juridictions étrangères pour posséder des biens immobiliers, ce qui facilite le mouvement transfrontalier de fonds illicites. Cette méthode rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux de fonds, ce qui démontre une méthode utilisée pour dissimuler des activités de blanchiment d’argent. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent immobilier Le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur immobilier est un problème mondial. Selon un rapport de Global Financial Integrity (GFI), plus de 2,3 milliards de dollars ont été blanchis dans l’immobilier américain entre 2015 et 2021. Cela montre à quel point l’immobilier reste l’un des moyens les plus populaires de transférer des fonds illicites. Autre exemple, au cours de la dernière décennie, environ 20 milliards de dollars sont entrés sur le marché immobilier dans la région du Grand Toronto au Canada sans que les autorités de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ne fassent l’objet [d’un examen minutieux (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Région | Quantité blanchie (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | États-Unis | 2,3 milliards de dollars | | Grand Toronto, Canada | 20 milliards de dollars | Ces exemples soulignent l’importance de la vigilance et de la conformité efficace en [matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le secteur immobilier. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées par les criminels et en étant conscients des [signaux d’alarme](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Signaux d’alarme\"), les professionnels du secteur immobilier peuvent jouer un rôle essentiel dans la perturbation de ces flux financiers illicites. Pour ceux qui travaillent dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière, comprendre ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) peut aider à identifier les risques potentiels et à mettre en œuvre des procédures efficaces [de diligence raisonnable à l’égard de la clientèle](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) . ## Scandales de blanchiment d’argent Même avec la mise en place de mesures strictes [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) et de contrôles réglementaires, des cas de blanchiment d’argent à grande échelle continuent de faire surface. Examinons quelques scandales notables de blanchiment d’argent qui ont fait la une des journaux ces dernières années. ### La fuite des fichiers FinCEN En 2020, la fuite des FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) Files a révélé un vaste réseau de corruption financière. Plus de 400 journalistes de 88 pays ont collaboré à cette enquête, découvrant un montant stupéfiant de 2 000 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes. Ces fichiers secrets contenaient des informations sur des transactions signalées comme suspectes par les banques, mais qui ont été autorisées à se poursuivre. Le rapport a mis en évidence de graves défaillances dans les systèmes bancaires mondiaux, permettant de transférer d’importantes sommes d’argent sans contrôles adéquats. La fuite des FinCEN Files a souligné l’importance d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et d’une application rigoureuse des réglementations [KYC (Know Your Customer).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) L’affaire est un rappel brutal de l’ampleur et de la complexité potentielles des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. ### La fuite des Panama Papers La fuite des Panama Papers en 2016 a été une révélation monumentale qui a révélé de nombreux cas très médiatisés de blanchiment d’argent, d’évasion fiscale et de contournement des sanctions internationales. La fuite a impliqué des banques, des cabinets d’avocats et des personnalités de premier plan dans le monde entier, révélant l’étendue des activités financières illicites dissimulées par le biais de [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) et de [sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/). Les Panama Papers ont mis en évidence l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives anonymes pour dissimuler la [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/), une tactique courante dans la [phase de superposition du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). En conséquence, le scandale a suscité des appels à une plus grande transparence dans les services financiers offshore et à une réglementation plus stricte pour identifier les bénéficiaires effectifs. ### Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka Le scandale de la « Troïka Laundromat » a impliqué le blanchiment de 4,6 milliards de dollars par le biais d’un réseau de fausses entreprises et de transactions financières illicites entre 2006 et 2013. Ce stratagème a impliqué de multiples parties dans différentes juridictions, ce qui montre la portée mondiale des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka a mis en lumière l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives pour dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites, une tactique courante dans la [phase d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/). Le scandale a donné lieu à des enquêtes et à des actions en justice, soulignant davantage l’importance de la coopération mondiale dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. Chacun de ces scandales souligne l’importance de mesures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et la nécessité constante de faire preuve de vigilance et d’application de la loi. En étudiant ces « exemples de blanchiment d’argent », les professionnels de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux comprendre les tactiques employées par les blanchisseurs d’argent et la façon de détecter et de prévenir ces activités illicites. ## Tirer les leçons des affaires de blanchiment d’argent Comprendre des scénarios du monde réel est l’un des moyens les plus efficaces de comprendre le processus complexe du blanchiment d’argent. Cette section examine de plus près certains des exemples de blanchiment d’argent les plus significatifs de l’histoire récente afin de fournir des informations précieuses sur la façon dont ces événements se sont déroulés et les leçons apprises. ### L’affaire Wachovia Bank En 2010, la Wachovia Bank a été impliquée dans une importante opération de blanchiment d’argent impliquant des cartels de la drogue mexicains. Entre 2004 et 2007, la banque a facilité le blanchiment de près de 390 milliards de dollars par l’intermédiaire de ses succursales. Les fonds illicites, glanés lors de la vente de drogue aux États-Unis, ont été passés en contrebande à travers la frontière mexicaine et ont ensuite été retournés sur les comptes américains de Wachovia. La banque n’a pas vérifié l’origine de ces fonds, manquant ainsi à ses obligations en matière de [connaissance du client (KYC).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) Au lieu de poursuites, Wachovia a payé une amende de 160 millions de dollars et s’est engagé à améliorer ses [procédures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AML).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) ### L’affaire de la Standard Chartered Bank La Standard Chartered Bank s’est heurtée à de lourdes sanctions pour des violations répétées des sanctions américaines. Initialement condamnée à une amende de 670 millions de dollars en 2012 pour des violations impliquant l’Iran, la banque a de nouveau été accusée en 2019 d’ignorer les sanctions contre des pays tels que le Zimbabwe, la Birmanie, l’Iran, le Soudan, Cuba et la Syrie. Pour ces infractions, les autorités américaines et britanniques ont infligé à Standard Chartered une amende totale de 1,1 milliard de dollars, soulignant les graves conséquences du non-respect du droit international. ### L’affaire Danske Bank La succursale estonienne de Danske Bank a servi d’intermédiaire pour environ 228 milliards de dollars de fonds blanchis entre 2007 et 2015. Ce scandale, impliquant des milliers de clients suspects, a attiré l’attention du public sur les manquements de la banque en matière de conformité. Les autorités danoises ont infligé des amendes d’un montant total de 2 millions de dollars et ont attribué la faute à plusieurs responsables de la banque. ### L’affaire BCCI La Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) s’est livrée à des activités de fraude et de [blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) totalisant jusqu’à 23 milliards de dollars américains. La BCCI a utilisé des stratagèmes sophistiqués de blanchiment d’argent tels que [des sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), des paradis fiscaux, des commissions et des pots-de-vin. La fermeture de la banque en 1991 a donné lieu à de nombreuses actions en justice, notamment la poursuite de la Banque d’Angleterre par la BCCI pour négligence dans l’identification des signes avant-coureurs. Cette affaire met en évidence l’importance de solides programmes de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment [d’argent (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent soulignent l’importance de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et de la nécessité de comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) pour détecter et dissuader la criminalité financière. En tirant les leçons de ces cas, les professionnels de la conformité et de la gestion des risques peuvent mieux préparer et protéger leurs organisations contre des situations similaires.

Avec l’un des dispositifs les plus robustes et efficaces au monde1, la France poursuit son engagement et s’applique à préserver l’intégrité de son système financier et renforcer l’efficacité de son arsenal de LCB-FT. L’évolution des méthodes de blanchiment de capitaux et de financement du terrorisme (BC-FT) utilisées par les criminels et l’émergence de nouveaux modes opératoires appellent une adaptation continue du cadre législatif et réglementaire. Retour sur un an de LCB-FT – une rétrospective en 3 volets : 1 - [Les nouvelles dispositions et orientations en matière de LCB-FT nées en 2024, au niveau européen et au niveau national](https://www.twobirds.com/fr/insights/2025/france/lcb-ft--retrospective-2024---partie-1) **2 -** **Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires** 3 - Les cryptoactifs, le nouveau hot-topic LCB-FT # Partie 2 : Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires ## 1. Les grands arrêts de la Cour de cassation en matière de blanchiment #### [Crim. 19 juin 2024, FS-B, n° 22-81.808](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000049533701?init=true&page=1&query=22-81.808&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) – Incidences du manquement d’une banque à ses obligations de vigilance en matière LCB-FT. C’est assurément l’arrêt de l’année en la matière – l’avenir dira s’il appartient aux grands arrêts qui ont les honneurs des ouvrages. Dans cet arrêt très commenté2 , la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions dans lesquelles un manquement aux obligations de vigilance imposées au titre de la législation anti-blanchiment était constitutif du délit de blanchiment au sens de l’article 324-1 du Code pénal. D’un côté, elle a pour la première fois expressément affirmé que le seul manquement d’une banque aux obligations de vigilance ne peut constituer un concours apporté à une opération de blanchiment du produit des infractions commises par son client. De l’autre, elle a justifié la condamnation de la banque dès lors qu’au regard des informations dont disposait cette dernière concernant le fonctionnement du compte litigieux, celle-ci ne pouvait ignorer l’origine frauduleuse des fonds y figurant. Dans ces conditions, la mise à disposition d’un compte bancaire dans l’un de ses établissements et l’exécution d’ordres de virement des sommes y figurant vers des comptes à l’étranger, qui sont eux des actes positifs, sont susceptibles de caractériser la participation de la banque à des opérations de blanchiment. Les commentateurs ne pourront certes y voir une responsabilité pour seul manquement aux obligations de vigilance mais les professionnels reconnaitront la finesse de la distinction opérée par la Cour. Celle-ci invite manifestement les établissements bancaires à la plus grande vigilance, dès lors que des fautes d’imprudence ou de négligence, des erreurs d’analyse ou des insuffisances de contrôles, associées à une absence de déclaration ou à une déclaration tardive, pourraient permettre de considérer qu’ils ont apporté, « en connaissance de cause », leur concours à des opérations de blanchiment. #### [Crim. 10 janvier 2024, n°](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) [22-85.721](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Portée limitée de la présomption d’illicéité des sommes objets du délit de blanchiment douanier. Dans cet arrêt, la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions pouvant conduire à une déclaration de culpabilité au titre d’un blanchiment douanier. Après avoir rappelé sa position selon laquelle le cumul des qualifications douanières et pénales pour un même fait ne porte pas atteinte au principe *non bis in idem*, la Cour a censuré la décision insuffisamment motivée des juges du fond qui s’étaient bornés, pour faire application de la présomption posée par l’article 415-1 du Code des douanes, à relever la seule impossibilité de justifier de l’origine et de la licéité des fonds. Il incombait en effet aux juges du fond non seulement de rechercher si les conditions matérielles, juridiques ou financières de l’opération d’exportation, d’importation, de transfert ou de compensation ne paraissaient obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler l’origine illicite des fonds, mais également de rechercher si elles ne paraissaient pas obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler qu’ils étaient le produit d’une des trois catégories3. Le transport sans déclaration ne suffit donc pas à caractériser le produit illicite à l’origine du blanchiment. #### [Crim. 13 mars 2024, n° 22-83.689](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000051553772?init=true&page=1&query=22-83.689&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Caractérisation de la circonstance aggravante d’habitude en matière de blanchiment. Dans cet arrêt, la chambre criminelle a apporté d’utiles précisions sur la circonstance aggravante d’habitude liée à la commission du blanchiment. Pour la première fois, elle affirmé que la circonstance d’habitude, énoncée à l’article 324-2, 1° du Code pénal, ne s’attache pas au blanchiment mais résulte de la multiplication des opérations de conversion et de dissimulation du produit de l’infraction d’origine, et ce peu important que les fonds blanchis proviennent d’un unique délit4 . Le caractère habituel s’attache ainsi non pas au à l’infraction d’origine mais aux éléments matériels du blanchiment. #### [Crim., 16 octobre 2024, n° 23-82.720](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050384866?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.720&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment. La preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment a été abordé dans un arrêt d’octobre 2024. Si les juges du fond peuvent déduire la connaissance par l’agent de l’origine criminelle ou délictuelle de l’opération de blanchiment des circonstances de fait entourant l’acte ou de sa qualité de professionnel, les éléments pris en considération doivent être suffisamment certains. Doit ainsi être censuré l’arrêt qui se fonde sur le motif hypothétique selon lequel *« il parait difficilement concevable qu’en tant que gérante, la prévenue ne se soit pas aperçue des encaissements importantes qui prévalaient sur ses comptes, et des flux financiers qui en découlaient alors qu’elle-même a perçu des sommes en contrepartie des opérations qu’elle effectuait »* pour considérer que celle-ci avait connaissance de l’origine des fonds versés sur son compte bancaire et avait eu l’intention de les dissimuler. On ne peut que saluer ce rappel à la nécessaire rigueur dans l’appréciation des comportements de blanchiment et de l’élément intentionnel, souvent trop vite balayé. #### [Crim. 4 septembre 2024, n° 22-87.061](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050192590?init=true&page=1&query=+22-87.061+&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) et [Crim. 18 septembre 2024, n° 23-82.477](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050290543?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.477&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Rappels en matière de prescription Aux termes de deux arrêts plus confidentiels, la Cour a également a fait quelques rappels utiles en matière de prescription et des délais spécifiques en matière d’infraction occulte ou dissimulée. D’une part, lorsque le délit est occulte ou dissimulé, le point de la prescription doit être reporté à la date de la dénonciation des faits au ministère public ayant permis la révélation du délit. Tel est notamment le cas lorsque les transferts de fonds provenant de délits de blanchiment d’abus de confiance et d’abus de biens sociaux vers des comptes étrangers ont été entrepris selon des modalités destinées à dissimuler tant l’existence des investissements à l’étranger que les revenus générés, notamment à l’aide d’une comptabilité irrégulière et d’opérations financières ou comptables complexes faisant obstacle à tout traçabilité5 . D’autre part, elle précise que l’opération de blanchiment doit s’entendre non seulement de l’opération de placement initial des fonds sur un compte occulte mais également des opérations de réemploi de ces fonds, le tout constituant des opérations de dissimulation, placement et conversion ; de telle sorte que c’est la dernière de ces opérations qui doit être retenue dans la détermination du point de départ du délai de prescription6. ## 2. Répression judiciaire et réglementaire du blanchiment : les affaires qui ont marqué 2024 Les acteurs du monde bancaire et financier, premiers exposés au risque de poursuites et de sanction en matière LCB-FT, n’ont évidemment pas été épargnés par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires, qui ont prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions qui ont attiré notre attention, en France évidemment, mais également à l’étranger. ### 2.1 En France Après une année 2023 marquée par la confirmation de la sanction du géant UBS, 2024 marque la troisième année consécutive qu’une convention judiciaire d’intérêt public (CJIP) est conclue en matière de blanchiment, impliquant un établissement bancaire. Une CJIP a en effet été conclue le 27 août 2024 entre le procureur de la République financier et la société **Danske Bank A/S**, puis validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris le 18 septembre 20247 . Une information judiciaire, ouverte en avril 2015, avait mis en évidence des flux financiers constitutifs de fraude fiscale commis par la gérante de la société Decobat, lesquels transitaient par des comptes ouverts en Estonie, dans des livres de la succursale estonienne de la Danske Bank, la Sampo Bank. La gérante de Decobat avait été condamnée en janvier 2024, par comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité (CRPC), des infractions de fraude fiscale et blanchiment de fraude fiscale. Danske Bank A/S avait quant à elle été mise en examen en février 2019 du chef de blanchiment de fraude fiscale en bande organisée. Il lui était en substance reproché d’avoir ouvert des comptes de passage fictifs destinés à recevoir de l’argent provenant de fraudes fiscales en bande organisée et d’avoir permis que ces comptes soient débités de multiples opérations dépourvues de justification économique, de sorte que ces opérations n’avaient d’autres but que de masquer la destination des fonds détournés et d’en faire bénéficier les destinataires à l’étranger. Le montant de l’amende d’intérêt public (6 028 799 euros) a été validé, notamment *« eu égard à la coopération active de la société, aux mesures correctrices engagées, et à la pertinence des investigations internes menées dans le cadre des poursuites engagées par les régulateurs danois et américains »*. L’intérêt des autorités de poursuites pour les acteurs institutionnels du secteur bancaire et financier a été confirmé par un de ses principaux acteurs : lors d’une récente conférence tenue à l’initiative du Directeur Général des Douanes et des droits indirects, le Procureur de la République Financier a rappelé que *« près 30 % des procédures du PNF visent l’infraction de blanchiment »*, soit au dernier comptage de la synthèse annuelle 2024, près de 230 procédures en cours8 . Ce n’est pas tout : l’autorité judiciaire est par ailleurs concurrencée par les autorités de sanction des régulateurs sectoriels, également très actives en 2024. La commission des sanctions de l’**ACPR** a ainsi rendu trois décisions dans le secteur bancaire, dont deux portant sur des manquements liés à la LCB-FT. La première concerne l’établissement de monnaie électronique **Treezor**, qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un million d’euros pour divers manquements très sérieux, qui affectaient gravement plusieurs éléments fondamentaux du dispositif de LCB-FT9. En particulier, il était reproché à la société de ne pas avoir déterminé, au moment du contrôle, un profil de risque de ses relations d’affaires lui permettant de respecter son obligation de vigilance constante. Son dispositif de surveillance des opérations était par ailleurs, sur de nombreux points, insuffisant. En plus d’une carence de son dispositif à l’origine de déclarations de soupçon tardives, des défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclarations de soupçon ont été relevés par la Commission. La fixation de la sanction pécuniaire a cependant tenu compte, dans le respect du principe de proportionnalité, des importantes actions de remédiation entreprises par Treezor et de sa situation financière. La seconde décision a été prononcée à l’encontre de la Banque régionale d’escompte et de dépôt (**BRED**), qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un montant de 2,5 millions d’euros à raison, outre plusieurs défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclaration de soupçon, de défaillances significatives dans son dispositif de surveillance des opérations. En l’occurrence, celles-ci étaient de nature à affecter sa capacité à identifier et traiter efficacement les opérations atypiques (exclusion de certains comptes du champ du dispositif automatisé de surveillance, paramétrage inapproprié de certains scénarios, informations incomplètes sur le revenu ou le chiffre d’affaires dans la base clients, motivation insuffisante du classement sans suite des alertes, notamment)10. La Commission des sanctions de l’**AMF** a également prononcé plusieurs sanctions en lien avec des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT. Dès janvier 2024, des sanctions pécuniaires ont été infligées à la société **SPI** (20 000 euros) et à son ancien dirigeant (10 0000 euros)11. Était notamment fait grief à la SPI de ne pas avoir disposé d’une procédure LCB-FT opérationnelle (les documents remis par elle à la mission de contrôle étant de simples modèles vierges établis par l’association professionnelle à laquelle elle adhère, lesquels ne peuvent être considérés comme une procédure LCB-FT et, *a fortiori*, opérationnelle) et de ne pas avoir mentionné le niveau de risque du client correspondant à la classification établie par la cartographie figurant dans ce dispositif. Au mois de juin, un blme et une sanction pécuniaire de 10 000 euros ont été prononcées à l’encontre de la société **Activ Finance Conseils**12. Parmi les griefs invoqués, il lui était reproché de ne pas avoir respecté ses obligations en matière de LCB-FT (notamment en ne collectant pas l’intégralité des cartographies des risques et des autres documents par la procédure de LCB-FT qu’elle avait adoptée). L’ensemble des manquements commis par la société ont été imputés à la dirigeant de l’époque, à l’encontre de laquelle un blme a également été prononcé. Un mois plus tard, un avertissement a été prononcé à l’encontre de la société de gestion de portefeuille **Inter Gestion REIM** et de ses dirigeants13. Des sanctions de 300 000 et 15 000 euros ont également été respectivement prononcées à leur égard. En l’occurrence, la société avait manqué à toute une série d’obligations, dont celle d’établir un dispositif LCB-FT adéquat et opérationnel puis d’en assurer l’effectivité (étaient notamment relevés : le caractère lacunaire des diligences effectuées au passif et à l’actif des fonds, l’absence de modalités d’échange automatique d’informations avec l’administration fiscale, ou encore l’absence de formation régulière du personnel). Le 12 septembre 2024, la Commission des Sanction de l’AMF a sanctionné la société de gestion de portefeuille **Sogenial Immobilier** et son président, et prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions pécuniaires d’un montant respectif de 150 000 euros et de 30 000 euros14. La société n’avait, entre autres, pas réalisé toutes les diligences de LCB-FT, ni lors d’investissements réalisés pour le compte des fonds gérés, ni à l’égard de clients ayant souscrit dans une SCPI, et n’avait pas mis en œuvre sa procédure LCB-FT. ### 2.2 À l’étranger Si la France est particulièrement active sur le plan judiciaire et réglementaire dans la lutte contre le blanchiment et la prévention des risques associés, d’autres pays se sont également illustrés cette année, par l’importance, aux plans théorique ou pécuniaire, des sanctions prononcées contre des acteurs du secteur financier. À **Monaco**, quelques mois après l’ajout de la principauté sur la « liste grise » de surveillance renforcée du GAFI, deux anciens banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende de 10 000 euros et à des peines d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir participé dans le blanchiment de millions d’euros déposés en espèces par deux hommes d’affaires italiens. Dans une affaire connexe de l’affaire, trois autres banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende comprise entre 5000 et 7000 euros pour non-déclaration de dépôts en espèces suspects. En **Suisse**, le procès en appel lié à la « Bulgarian Connection » s’était ouvert en automne devant le Tribunal pénal fédéral. La Cour d’appel a finalement acquitté la banque **UBS** – qui avait hérité de cette affaire après l’absorption du Crédit Suisse plus tôt dans l’année – du chef de blanchiment d’argent aggravé. Elle a néanmoins confirmé partiellement les condamnations de deux coprévenus pour leurs activités en lien avec une organisation criminelle bulgare active dans le trafic de stupéfiants et le blanchiment d’argent15. A l’instar de la France, la **Suisse** et les différents membres de l’Union Européenne disposent, à côté des autorités de poursuites judiciaires, de puissants régulateurs du secteur bancaire et financier dont le niveau d’implication dans la poursuite des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT est en constante augmentation, à l’image des sanctions pécuniaires qu’elles imposent. Ainsi, en Suisse, au terme d’une procédure d’*enforcement*, l’Autorité fédérale de surveillance des marchés financiers (FINMA), a prononcé une confiscation de 12,7 millions de francs suisses *« indûment obtenus »* à l’encontre de la banque privée **Mirabaud & Cie SA** pour avoir manqué à ses obligations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et avoir gravement enfreint les règles du droit des marchés financiers. Elle a notamment considéré que la banque n’avait pas suffisamment vérifié et documenté les ayants droit économiques de nombreuses transactions, alors même qu’il existait des indices de risques accrus de blanchiment d’argent et que des signaux d’alertes concernant ces relations d’affaires avaient été émis16 . L’équivalent de la FINMA en **Allemagne**, l’Autorité Fédérale de Supervision Financière (BaFin) a sanctionné la banque **N26 Bank AG** à une amende de 9,2 millions d’euros pour des insuffisances lors de déclarations de soupçons en 2022. Sont notamment reprochés à la banque en ligne des retards systématiques dans la transmission des soupçons de blanchiment d’argent. Cette amende s’ajoute à celle de 4,25 millions d’euros, prononcée en 2021 pour des failles dans son dispositif de prévention du blanchiment. En **Suède**, **Klarna** a été sanctionnée à une amende de 500 millions de couronnes suédoises (près de 45 millions d’euros) par l’autorité de surveillance financière suédoise *(Finansinspektionen)* pour divers manquements. Lui sont reprochées d’importantes lacunes dans l’évaluation générale des risques ainsi que l’absence de procédures et de lignes directrices permettant d’identifier les situations dans lesquelles des mesures de diligence raisonnable devaient être prises pour les clients utilisant leur produit de facturation. L’année 2024 aura également été productive pour la *Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)* britannique, qui a infligé de lourdes amendes pour des manquements à la législation sur le blanchiment d’argent : 16,7 millions de livres sterling (19,2 millions d’euros) à **Metro Bank** pour manquement aux contrôles de lutte contre le blanchiment et défaut de surveillance des transactions ; 3,5 millions de livres sterling (4,1 millions d’euros) à la plateforme de cryptomonnaies **Coinbase** pour des lacunes dans la conception et le suivi des procédures de vérification des clients ; et près de 29 millions de livres sterling (35 millions d’euros) à la banque Starling pour *« laxisme choquant »* dans ses contrôles anti-blanchiment. Si on ignore encore quelle sera la magnitude des dernières lubies du Président américain en matière de lutte contre les infractions économiques et financières (et notamment la « pause » forcée du *Foreign Corrupt Practice Act* (FCPA) annoncée aux premières lueurs de l’année 2025), on se souviendra qu’avant le cataclysme, le DOJ prenait sa part dans l’effort mené par les autorités judiciaires et de régulation dans la lutte contre le blanchiment. La banque canadienne Toronto-Dominion Bank (**TD Bank**) a ainsi accepté de plaider coupable aux Etats-Unis pour une infraction à la législation américaine en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment. Il lui était reproché d’avoir permis à trois réseaux de blanchir plus de 670 millions de dollars et d’avoir manqué à ses obligations de contrôle de des transactions pendant près de 10 ans. La banque doit désormais s’acquitter d’une pénalité de 3 milliards de dollars et modifier ses procédures internes17. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ [1] [Plan d\\'action pour lutter contre le blanchiment de capitaux, le financement du terrorisme et de la prolifération d\\'armes de destruction massive (2021-2022)](https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=CBFBD522-0731-4DBE-919B-3B8E1340F2D1&filename=811%20-%20Plan%20d%27action%20pour%20lutter%20contre%20le%20blanchiment%20de%20capitaux%2C%20le%20financement%20du%20terrorisme%20et%20de%20la%20prolif%C3%A9ration%202021-2022.pdf).

The settlement followed a judicial investigation opened in April 2015 that uncovered financial flows constituting tax fraud committed by the manager of Decobat, with funds transiting through accounts in Estonia held at Danske Bank's Estonian branch, Sampo Bank. The manager of Decobat was convicted in January 2024 for tax fraud and laundering of tax fraud. Danske Bank A/S was indicted in February 2019 for laundering of organized tax fraud, accused of opening fictitious transit accounts to receive money from organized tax fraud and allowing these accounts to be debited through multiple unjustified transactions to conceal the destination of misappropriated funds and benefit foreign recipients.

Les blanchisseurs, pas de frontières. Ces derniers profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance et des législations européennes pour passer entre les mailles du filet. Avec la création, cet été, de l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (Anti-Money Laundering Authority ou AMLA), l’Union européenne peut-elle centraliser la lutte contre la finance illicite?** * * * L’inclusion probable et imminente de Monaco, symbole mondial de richesse et de discrétion, dans la [liste des pays à haut risque en matière de blanchiment d’argent](https://www.touteleurope.eu/economie-et-social/blanchiment-d-argent-quels-pays-sont-consideres-a-risque-par-la-commission-europeenne/) établie par l’Union européenne (UE), a suscité de nombreuses réactions. L’ajout potentiel de la principauté sur la liste noire met en évidence le défi que représente la lutte contre la finance illicite. Dans une zone comme l’UE, l’ouverture des frontières contraste avec la mise en œuvre et la surveillance des mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ([l’AML –Anti-Money Laundering](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en?prefLang=fr)). Des politiques qui restent largement confinées à la responsabilité des différents pays membres. Une [transaction financière](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022SC0344&utm_) peut commencer dans un pays à haut risque, passer par une banque européenne et se terminer par une transaction immobilière à Londres ou un trust suisse. C’est précisément pour cette raison que la coordination internationale est si importante. Sans elle, les blanchisseurs d’argent profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance, en particulier au sein de l’UE. Avec l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent , ou Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), qui entre en fonction cet été, l’Union européenne opte pour la [centralisation](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jfc-03-2023-0059/full/pdf). Les politiques européennes et françaises de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ont échoué [pour plusieurs raisons](https://op.europa.eu/fr/publication-detail/-/publication/03f702aa-03bb-11ec-8f47-01aa75ed71a1/language-fr): une application inégale des réglementations, un manque de ressources et de coopération internationale, des sanctions peu dissuasives face à des techniques toujours plus sophistiquées et un phénomène global difficile à cerner. Pour progresser, il faut renforcer l’harmonisation des règles, augmenter les moyens des autorités, adopter des technologies avancées et améliorer la transparence des structures. Des objectifs que l’AMLA a précisément [vocation à concrétiser](https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en). Cent milliards d’euros par an ----------------------------- Quelques rares et prudentes estimations confirment que les flux financiers illicites traversent trop facilement les frontières et que leurs montants sont colossaux. Selon les estimations de l’Office des Nations unies contre la drogue et le crime (ONUDC), le [blanchiment d’argent représenterait de 2% à 5% du PIB mondial, soit de 800 milliards à 2 000 milliards de dollars américains](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) actuels. Dans l’Union européenne, le produit des activités criminelles est [estimé à plus de 100 milliards d’euros par an](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/criminal_asset_recovery_in_the_eu_web_version_0.pdf), dont seul un pourcentage négligeable est finalement saisi. [Des recherches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75653-x) estiment que l’argent provenant du trafic de drogue, du trafic des personnes et du terrorisme passe souvent par des banques de 4 à 6 pays différents avant d’être blanchi et d’entrer dans l’économie légale. * * * ![Image 7](https://images.theconversation.com/files/652674/original/file-20250303-32-etg46y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip) _Du lundi au vendredi + le dimanche, recevez gratuitement les analyses et décryptages de nos experts pour un autre regard sur l’actualité.

La [Danske Bank](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180924-danemark-estonie-danske-bank-scandale-oligarque) est devenue l’épicentre du plus grand scandale de blanchiment d’argent en Europe. Il a été révélé que plus de 200 milliards d’euros de transactions suspectes ont transité par sa succursale estonienne. La [Deutsche Bank](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/banque-assurances/des-centaines-de-milliards-de-dollars-dargent-sale-blanchis-par-de-grandes-banques-1244280) a fait l’objet de multiples enquêtes pour avoir facilité des transferts illicites de plusieurs milliards d’euros, notamment par le biais de sa collaboration avec Danske et de ses liens avec le système _Russian Laundromat_. [ING](https://trends.levif.be/a-la-une/banque/ing-a-verse-775-millions-deuros-pour-regler-une-affaire-de-blanchiment/) a payé une amende de 775 millions d’euros aux autorités néerlandaises pour des violations de la législation anti-blanchiment en 2018. Tracfin en France ----------------- Les pays de l’Union européenne mettent en œuvre les directives européennes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, avec des niveaux d’ambition variables. La France a montré un [engagement ferme](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin/la-qualite-du-dispositif-francais-de-lbc-ft-reconnue-par-le-gafi) dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent grâce à l’approche de sa cellule de renseignement financier, [Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins (Tracfin)](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin). Elle a récemment renforcé son analyse des [transactions suspectes](https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/4153148-20250513-tracfin-recu-nombre-record-declarations-soupcon-2024), élargi sa coopération avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux et amélioré son utilisation des analyses de données avancées pour détecter les flux illicites complexes. Malgré ces progrès, certaines affaires récentes, comme les failles des [néobanques](https://theconversation.com/qonto-monabanq-hellobank-lascension-des-neobanques-ira-t-elle-trop-loin-242541) ou l’enquête visant BNP Paribas pour blanchiment via [Chypre](https://decouverte.challenges.fr/economie/france-bnp-paribas-pris-dans-une-enquete-pour-blanchiment-aggrave-liee-a-chypre_878359), montrent que des flux illicites échappent encore à la détection de Tracfin. Dissuader les défaillances des contrôles bancaires internes ----------------------------------------------------------- Malgré son poids économique, l’Allemagne a été [critiquée](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/cash-hungry-germany-criticised-by-watchdog-over-money-laundering) pour son implication insuffisante, ainsi que pour les défaillances de sa surveillance. La mise en œuvre de sa politique varie d’un Land à l’autre; les difficultés rencontrées en matière de coopération internationale, en particulier avant l’effondrement de la société spécialisée dans le paiement électronique Wirecard, n’aident pas. En revanche, les autorités néerlandaises ont suivi l’exemple des États-Unis. Ils ont infligé des amendes importantes à des établissements tels que [ING](https://www.prosecutionservice.nl/latest/news/2018/09/04/ing-pays-775-million-due-to-serious-shortcomings-in-money-laundering-prevention) et [ABN AMRO](https://apnews.com/article/business-netherlands-money-laundering-b7c07284946e1561c1f2231de30dcfef), démontrant ainsi leur ferme volonté de lutter contre la criminalité financière en dissuadant les défaillances des contrôles internes dans les banques. * * * _**Read more: [Credit Suisse: les leçons d’une lente descente aux enfers](https://theconversation.com/credit-suisse-les-lecons-dune-lente-descente-aux-enfers-202363)**_ * * * Ces approches inégales de la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans les États membres de l’UE s’expliquent par [plusieurs facteurs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0170_EN.html). Les différentes interprétations des règles en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent créent des lacunes dans la couverture juridique. Une coopération judiciaire transfrontalière irrégulière, en particulier avec les pays tiers, entrave l’efficacité de l’application de la législation. En outre, les cellules de renseignement financier ont des pouvoirs et des responsabilités très variables. L’absence de format standardisé pour les déclarations d’opérations suspectes complique l’intégration des données dans la plate-forme centrale de l’Union européenne. Elle rend la coordination des actions plus difficile qu’elle ne devrait l’être. Mais tout cela est sur le point de changer… Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AMLA) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Pour remédier à ces faiblesses, l’Union européenne est en train de créer l’[Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/753212c5-166b-48ae-a44f-ffbb09a1eede/files/3de11274-cba7-414d-b0dd-6fbfcabf4d10), ou _Anti-Money Laundering Authority_ (AMLA). Elle devrait être pleinement opérationnelle à partir de 2028. Basée à Francfort, l’AMLA supervisera directement une quarantaine d’établissements financiers transfrontaliers à haut risque, harmonisera l’application des règles dans les États membres et coordonnera les régulateurs nationaux. Elle aura le pouvoir de mener des inspections sur place, d’imposer des sanctions et de renforcer le cadre global de l’UE en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. ![Image 8](https://images.theconversation.com/files/678599/original/file-20250707-56-wmpqc5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip) L’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, créée en 2024 par l’Union européenne, est chargée de la traque des flux financiers suspects.[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stuttgart-germany-03102025-person-holding-cellphone-2604415937) Afin de soutenir le rôle de l’AMLA, l’UE introduit un règlement unique qui remplacera les différentes législations nationales par un ensemble de normes unifiées dans tous les États membres. Avec l’AMLA, Bruxelles parie que la centralisation peut réussir là où la décentralisation a échoué. La décentralisation signifie que chaque État membre appliquait les règles anti-blanchiment à sa manière, en transposant les directives européennes dans son droit national. Cela a conduit à des normes [contradictoires](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12027-024-00805-9). Par exemple, certains pays imposaient des seuils de déclaration différents ou avaient des définitions divergentes des entités à surveiller, rendant la coopération inefficace et les contrôles inégaux. Avertissement symbolique ------------------------ L’AMLA pourrait se heurter à des difficultés. La complexité des différences juridiques et institutionnelles entre les États membres, la mobilisation de nombreuses expertises pour superviser un large éventail de secteurs, pourrait rendre ce travail fastidieux. La nécessité de trouver un équilibre entre les préoccupations en matière de souveraineté nationale et la nécessité d’une application efficace et unifiée dans toute l’UE également. Alors que l’Union européenne se prépare à lancer l’AMLA, l’inclusion de pays comme Monaco sur sa liste noire est un avertissement symbolique. Désormais, aucune juridiction, aussi riche ou prestigieuse soit-elle, n’est à l’abri d’un examen minutieux. Le devenir de l’AMLA comme véritable autorité de contrôle puissante dépendra de trois piliers: la volonté politique, la solidité de sa conception institutionnelle et l’ampleur des moyens humains et techniques qui lui seront alloués. Sans volonté politique, l’AMLA risque d’être affaiblie par les intérêts nationaux. Sans conception institutionnelle solide, ses compétences pourraient se heurter à des obstacles juridiques et bureaucratiques.

It is estimated that 2- 5% of the global GDP or US$800 billion-US$2 trillion is being laundered every year across the globe. The lower range itself is a significant amount for the world to consider. For comparison, Saudi Arabia’s estimated nominal GDP is US$748 billion in 2018, ranking the country at 19 in the world. In order to combat money laundering, governments have formulated and implemented policies, and they have been successful in identifying more and more laundering activities and subsequently taking remedial measures. Here is an attempt to portray some of the biggest money laundering cases by the estimated size of money being laundered in recent times. The figures have been converted into US dollars in some cases for easier comparison. ## Commerzbank (US$347 million) The London branch of Commerzbank is the subject of one of the most severe fines in the UK. Commerzbank was facing a $50 million fine in June 2020. This German banking firm ignored several warnings from the cautious regulator and failed to adopt necessary know-your-customer laws affecting thousands of the bank’s customers. In 2016 and 2017, the bank failed to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-kickback laws. Due to a shortage of staff in the anti-money laundering department, Commerzbank employed 47 additional employees, bringing the total number of AML professionals in the department to 50. This helped the bank avoid future fines. Despite this, the bank failed to accommodate and offer necessary anti-money laundering (AML) protections. ## Westpac Bank (US$11 billion) With 19 million global transactions, this Australian financial service resolved with AUSTRAC in 2020 for AML concerns. They ended up paying one of the largest fines in history as a result of their efforts to avoid the regulations. Westpac skirted around several provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act of 2006. The banks’ ignorance of the law resulted in the penalties, which are believed to be worth over $11 billion. The banks’ ignorance was linked to offshore paedophile rings in Southeast Asia, prompting harsh reprimands. Because many of the transactions were linked to the network, the authorities investigated the settlement, which resulted in a $1.3 billion fine. ## Goldman Sachs (US$600 million) The world-famous Goldman Sachs was hit with the greatest fine in 2020. In the business’s 151-year history, the biggest fine ever issued in the US represented the first time the company had ever pleaded guilty to any financial violation. The Malaysian unit of Goldman Sachs was involved in the [1MBD scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/1mdb-scandal-explained-a-tale-of-malaysias-missing-billions), which had been in the works for more than ten years. [Bribery](/glossary/bribery), money laundering, and gross misuse of consumer funds were all committed by the company. After agreeing to pay a $2.5 billion fine, an additional $1.4 billion was fined in order to avoid prosecution by paying out 1MBD assets. ## Wachovia (US$390 billion) Now part of Wells Fargo, Wachovia was one of the biggest banks in the US. In 2010, the bank was found to have allowed drug cartels in Mexico to launder close to US$390 billion through its branches during 2004-2007. The drug cartels used to smuggle US dollars received from drug sales in the US across the Mexican border. Then, they used money exchangers to deposit the money into their bank accounts in Mexico, where regulatory requirements with regard to the source of funds were not on par with current standards. Later, the money was wired back to Wachovia’s accounts in the US, and the bank failed to check the origin of these funds. In addition, the drug cartels used Wachovia’s bulk cash service to ship back banknotes to the US. ## Standard Chartered (US$265 billion) The British banking giant in 2012 was accused by New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) of its failures in anti-money laundering controls that helped the Iranian government to circumvent US regulations to clean money to the tune of US$265 billion over a period of 10 years. In addition, the bank was accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Libya and Sudan. ## Danske Bank (US$228 billion) Denmark’s largest bank came into the limelight after the European Commission described its US$228 billion money laundering case as the biggest scandal in Europe. The bank’s Estonian branch allegedly had thousands of suspicious customers who made use of the bank’s weak controls to carry out illicit transactions worth about US$228 billion during 2007-2015. ## Nauru (US$70 billion) Nauru, once known for its tax-haven status with a large number of shell banks, helped Russian criminals launder an estimated US$70 billion in 1998. At that time, the island country in Micronesia, northeast of Australia, was allegedly allowing its banks to operate without properly identifying its customers and checking the source of deposits. ## BCCI (US$23 billion) From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and its customers were found to have committed fraud and money laundering activities totaling US$23 billion. BCCI was formed up purposefully to circumvent centralised regulatory supervision, according to investigators in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. To avoid regulatory inspection, the bank allegedly used a variety of complicated strategies, including shell firms, secrecy havens, kickbacks, and bribery. ## HSBC ($8 billion) In 2012, the bank was fined for having insufficient control measures, which permitted the laundering of an estimated $8 billion over a seven-year period. Provision of banking services and US dollars to some Saudi Arabian banks with apparent ties to terrorists, circumventing international sanctions and allowing transactions involving blacklisted countries such as Iran and North Korea. It also included improper controls at HSBC Mexico despite its apparent drug trafficking and money laundering problem was among the complaints levelled against the bank. For failing to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or know-your-customer regulations, all of the above-mentioned enterprises and financial institutions faced harsh penalties. Some of these financial institutions unwittingly participated in serious criminal behaviour and crimes by failing to pay attention to the protocols or deciding not to follow them. Other institutions can prevent these blunders by comprehending and implementing the established standards, ensuring that money laundering is not unintentionally carried out. Thus, they can avoid being part in money laundering cases. Advances in technology, particularly in financial services, have made it possible for criminals to move money around the world with ease. Launderers have been spotted devising complex ways to go beyond a government’s remedies. Banks have started realising the fact that their legacy rule-based systems cannot effectively mitigate risks related to money laundering. Now, they need to embrace advanced technology that can effectively solve their problems of getting involved in money laundering cases. Financial institutions can effectively make use of solutions based on machine learning, such as [Tookitaki’s AML Suite](/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), to counter money laundering cases.

A senior citizen in Navi Mumbai answered a number that appeared to belong to the police. Within hours, she was trapped on a video call with men in uniforms, accused of laundering money for terrorists. Terrified, she wired ₹21 lakh into what she believed was a government-controlled account. She was not alone. In August 2025, cases of “digital arrest” scams surged across India. An elderly couple in Madhya Pradesh drained nearly ₹50 lakh of their life savings after spending 13 days under constant video surveillance by fraudsters posing as investigators. In Rajkot, criminals used the pretext of a real anti-terror operation to extort money from a student. These scams are not crude phishing attempts. They are meticulously staged psychological operations, exploiting people’s deepest fears of authority and social disgrace. Victims are not tricked into handing over passwords. They are coerced, minute by minute, into making transfers themselves. The results are devastating, both for individuals and the wider financial system. ## Background of the Scam The anatomy of a digital arrest scam follows a chillingly consistent script. **1. The Call of Fear** Fraudsters begin with a phone call, often masked to resemble an official number. The caller claims the victim’s details have surfaced in a serious crime: drug trafficking, terror financing, or money laundering. The consequences are presented as immediate arrest, frozen accounts, or ruined reputations. **2. Escalation to Video** To heighten credibility, the fraudster insists on switching to a video call. Victims are connected to people wearing uniforms, holding forged identity cards, or even sitting before backdrops resembling police stations and courtrooms. **3. Isolation and Control** Once on video, the victim is told they cannot disconnect. In some cases, they are monitored round the clock, ordered not to use their phone for any purpose other than the call. Contact with family or friends is prohibited, under the guise of “confidential investigations.” **4. The Transfer of Funds** The victim is then directed to transfer money into so-called “secure accounts” to prove their innocence or pay bail. These accounts are controlled by criminals and serve as the first layer in complex laundering networks. Victims, believing they are cooperating with the law, empty fixed deposits, break retirement savings, and transfer sums that can take a lifetime to earn. The method blends social engineering with coercive control. It is not the theft of data, but the hijacking of human behaviour. ## What the Case Revealed The 2025 wave of digital arrest scams in India exposed three critical truths about modern fraud. **1. Video Calls Are No Longer a Guarantee of Authenticity** For years, people considered video more secure than phone calls or emails. If you could see someone’s face, the assumption was that they were genuine. These scams demolished that trust. Fraudsters showed that live video, like written messages, can be staged, manipulated, and weaponised. **2. Authority Bias is a Fraudster’s Greatest Weapon** Humans are hardwired to respect authority, especially law enforcement. By impersonating police or investigators, criminals bypass the victim’s critical reasoning. Fear of prison or social disgrace outweighs logical checks. **3. Coercion Multiplies the Damage** Unlike [phishing](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/phishing) or one-time deceptions, digital arrests involve prolonged psychological manipulation. Victims are kept online for days, bombarded with threats and false evidence. Under this pressure, even cautious individuals break down. The results are not minor losses, but catastrophic financial wipe-outs. **4. Organised Networks Are Behind the Scenes** The professionalism and scale suggest syndicates, not lone operators. From forged documents to layered mule accounts, the fraud points to criminal hubs capable of running scripted operations across borders. ## Impact on Financial Institutions and Corporates Though victims are individuals, the implications extend far into the financial and corporate world. **1. Reputational Risk** When victims lose life savings through accounts within the banking system, they often blame their bank as much as the fraudster. Even if technically blameless, institutions suffer a hit to public trust. **2. Pressure on Fraud Systems** Digital arrest scams exploit authorised transactions. Victims themselves make the transfers. Traditional detection tools that focus on unauthorised access or password breaches cannot easily flag these cases. **3. Global Movement of Funds** Money from scams rarely stays local. Transfers are routed across borders within hours, layered through mule accounts, e-wallets, and fintech platforms. This complicates recovery and exposes gaps in international coordination. **4. Corporate Vulnerability** The threat is not limited to retirees or individuals. In Singapore earlier this year, a finance director was tricked into wiring half a million dollars during a deepfake board call. Digital arrest tactics could just as easily target corporate employees handling high-value transactions. **5. Regulatory Expectations** As scams multiply, regulators are pressing institutions to demonstrate stronger customer protections, more resilient monitoring, and greater collaboration. Failure to act risks not only reputational damage but also regulatory penalties. ## Lessons Learned from the Scam **For Individuals** * Treat unsolicited calls from law enforcement with suspicion. Real investigations do not begin on the phone. * Verify independently by calling the published numbers of agencies. * Watch for signs of manipulation, such as demands for secrecy or threats of immediate arrest. * Educate vulnerable groups, particularly senior citizens, about how these scams operate. **For Corporates** * Train employees, especially those in finance roles, to recognise coercion tactics. * Require secondary verification for urgent, high-value transfers, especially when directed to new accounts. * Encourage a speak-up culture where staff can challenge suspicious instructions without fear of reprimand. **For Financial Institutions** * Monitor for mule account activity. Unexplained inflows followed by rapid withdrawals are a red flag. * Run customer awareness campaigns, explaining how digital arrest scams work. * Share intelligence with peers and regulators to prevent repeat incidents across institutions. ## The Role of Technology in Prevention Digital arrest scams prove that traditional safeguards are insufficient. Fraudsters are not stealing credentials but manipulating behaviour. Prevention requires smarter, adaptive systems. **1. Behavioural Monitoring** Transactions made under duress often differ from normal patterns. Advanced analytics can detect anomalies, such as sudden large transfers from accounts with low historical activity. **2. Typology-Driven Detection** Platforms like Tookitaki’s [FinCense](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) leverage the [AFC Ecosystem](https://www.afcecosystem.org) to encode real-world scam scenarios into detection logic. As digital arrest typologies are identified, they can be integrated quickly to improve monitoring. **3. AI-Powered Simulations** Institutions can run simulations of coercion-based scams to test whether their processes would withstand them. These exercises reveal gaps in escalation and verification controls. **4. Federated Learning for Collective Defence** With federated learning, insights from one bank can be shared across many without exposing sensitive data. If one institution sees a pattern in digital arrest cases, others can benefit almost instantly. **5. Smarter Alert Management** Agentic AI can review and narrate the context of alerts, allowing investigators to understand whether unusual activity stems from duress. This speeds up response times and prevents irreversible losses. ## Conclusion The digital arrest scam is not just a fraud. It is a form of psychological captivity, where victims are imprisoned through fear on their own devices. In 2025, India saw a surge of such cases, stripping people of their savings and shaking trust in digital communications. The message is clear: scams no longer rely on technical breaches. They rely on exploiting human trust. For individuals, the defence is awareness and verification. For corporates, it is embedding strong protocols and encouraging a culture of questioning. For financial institutions, the challenge is profound. They must detect authorised transfers made under coercion, collaborate across borders, and deploy AI-powered defences that learn as fast as the criminals do. If 2024 was the year of deepfake deception, 2025 is becoming the year of coercion-based fraud. The industry’s response will determine whether scams like digital arrests remain isolated tragedies or become a systemic crisis. Protecting trust is no longer optional. It is the frontline of financial crime prevention. Blogs 25 Aug 2025 5 min read ## Stablecoins Are Booming. Is Compliance Falling Behind? Programmable money isn’t a futuristic buzzword anymore — it’s here, and it’s scaling at breakneck speed. In 2024, stablecoin transactions exceeded $27 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. From international remittances to e-commerce, stablecoins are reshaping how money moves across borders. But there’s a catch: the same features that make stablecoins so powerful — speed, cost efficiency, accessibility — also make them attractive for financial crime. Instant, irreversible, and identity-light transactions have created a compliance challenge unlike any before. For regulators, banks, and fintechs, the question is clear: can compliance scale as fast as stablecoins? ## The Rise of Stablecoins: More Than Just Crypto Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar or euro. Unlike Bitcoin or Ether, they aren’t designed for volatility — they’re designed for utility. That’s why they’ve become the backbone of digital payments and decentralised finance (DeFi). * **Cross-border remittances**: Workers abroad can send money home cheaply and instantly. * **Trading and settlements**: Exchanges use stablecoins as liquidity anchors. * **Merchant adoption**: From small retailers to payment giants like PayPal (with its **PYUSD stablecoin** launched in 2023), stablecoin rails are entering mainstream commerce. With global players like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) dominating, and even central banks exploring CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), it’s clear stablecoins are no longer niche. They are programmable, scalable, and systemically important. But scale brings scrutiny. ## The Compliance Gap: Why Old Tools Don’t Work Most financial institutions still rely on compliance infrastructure designed decades ago for slower, linear payment systems. Batch settlements, SWIFT messages, and pre-clearing windows gave compliance teams time to check, flag, or stop suspicious activity. Stablecoins operate on entirely different principles: * **Real-time settlement**: Transactions confirm in seconds. * **Pseudonymous wallets**: No guaranteed link between a wallet and its true owner. * **DeFi composability**: Funds can move through multiple protocols, contracts, and blockchains with no central chokepoint. * **Irreversibility**: Once sent, funds can’t be clawed back. This creates an environment where bad actors can launder funds at the speed of code. Legacy compliance systems — built for yesterday’s risks — simply cannot keep up. ## The New Typologies Emerging on Stablecoin Rails Financial crime doesn’t stand still. It adapts to new rails faster than regulation or compliance can. Here are some typologies unique to stablecoins: 1. **Money Mule Networks** Organised groups recruit international students or gig workers to act as “cash-out points,” moving illicit funds through stablecoin wallets before converting back to fiat. 2. **Cross-Chain Laundering** Criminals exploit bridges between blockchains (e.g., Ethereum to Tron or Solana) to break traceability, making it harder to follow the money. This tactic was highlighted in multiple reports after North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered hundreds of millions in stolen crypto across chains. 3. **DeFi Layering** Funds are routed through decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, or automated market makers to mix flows and obscure origins. The U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash in 2022 marked a watershed moment, underscoring how DeFi mixers can become systemic laundering tools. 4. **Sanctions Evasion** With traditional banking rails restricted, sanctioned entities increasingly turn to stablecoins. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has flagged stablecoin usage in multiple enforcement actions tied to Russia and other high-risk jurisdictions. Each of these typologies highlights the speed, complexity, and opacity of stablecoin-based laundering. They don’t look like traditional fiat red flags — they demand new methods of detection. ## What Compliance Needs to Look Like for Stablecoins To match the speed of programmable money, compliance must itself become programmable, adaptive, and dynamic. Static, rule-based systems are insufficient. Instead, compliance must shift to a risk infrastructure that is: ### 1. Risk-in-Motion Monitoring Rather than flagging transactions after they settle, monitoring must happen in real time, detecting structuring, layering, and unusual flow patterns as they unfold. ### 2. Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening Name checks aren’t enough. Risk detection must consider wallet metadata, behavioural history, device intelligence, and network analysis to surface high-risk entities hidden behind pseudonyms. ### 3. Wallet Risk Scoring A static “high-risk wallet list” doesn’t work in a world where wallets are created and discarded easily. Risk scoring must be dynamic and contextual, combining geolocation, device, transaction history, and counterparties into evolving risk profiles. This is compliance at the speed of programmable money. ## Tookitaki’s FinCense: Building the Trust Layer for Stablecoins At Tookitaki, we’re not retrofitting legacy tools to fit this new world. We’re building the infrastructure-grade compliance layer programmable money deserves. Here’s how [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) powers trust on stablecoin rails: * **Risk-in-Motion Monitoring** Detects structuring, layering, and anomalous flows across chains in real time. * **Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening** Goes beyond simple lists, screening metadata, networks, and behavioural red flags. * **Wallet Risk Scoring** Integrates device, location, and transaction intelligence to give every wallet a living, breathing risk profile. * **Federated Intelligence from the** [**AFC Ecosystem**](https://www.afcecosystem.org) Scenarios contributed by 200+ compliance experts worldwide enrich the system with the latest typologies. * **Agentic AI for Investigations** Accelerates investigations with an AI copilot, surfacing insights and reducing [false positives](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/false-positives). FinCense is modular, composable, and built for the future of programmable finance. Whether you’re a digital asset exchange, fintech, or bank integrating stablecoin rails, it enables you to operate with trust and resilience. ## Conclusion: Scaling Trust with Stablecoins Stablecoins are here to stay. They’re reshaping payments, cross-border transfers, and financial inclusion. But they’re also rewriting the rules of financial crime. The next phase of growth won’t be defined by speed or accessibility alone — it will be defined by trust. And trust comes from compliance that can move as fast and adapt as dynamically as programmable money itself. Stablecoins will define the next decade of finance. Whether they become rails for inclusion or loopholes for crime depends on how we build trust today. Tookitaki’s FinCense is here to make that trust possible. Blogs 20 Aug 2025 6 min read ## Ferraris, Ghost Cars, and Dirty Money: Inside Australia’s 2025 Barangaroo Laundering Scandal *In July 2025, Sydney’s Barangaroo precinct became the unlikely stage for one of Australia’s most audacious money laundering cases. Beyond the headlines about Ferraris and luxury goods lies a sobering truth: criminals are still exploiting the blind spots in Australia’s financial crime defences.* ## A Case That Reads Like a Movie Script On 30 July 2025, Australian police raided properties across Sydney and arrested two men—Bing “Michael” Li, 38, and Yizhe “Tony” He, 34. Both men were charged with an astonishing 194 fraud-related offences. Li faces 87 charges tied to AUD 12.9 million, while He faces 107 charges tied to about AUD 4 million. Authorities also froze AUD 38 million worth of assets, including Bentleys, Ferraris, designer goods, and property leases. At the heart of the case was a fraud and laundering scheme that funnelled stolen money into the high-end economy of cars, luxury fashion, and short-term property leases. Investigators dubbed them “ghost cars”—vehicles purchased as a way to obscure illicit funds. It’s a tale that grabs attention for its glitz, but what really matters is the deeper lesson: Australia still has critical AML blind spots that criminals know how to exploit. ## How the Syndicate Operated The mechanics of the scheme reveal just how calculated it was: * **Rapid loan cycling:** The accused are alleged to have obtained loans, often short-term, which were cycled quickly to create complex repayment patterns. This made tracing the origins of funds difficult. * **Luxury asset laundering:** The money was used to purchase high-value cars (Ferraris, Bentleys, Mercedes) and designer items from brands like Louis Vuitton. Assets of prestige become a laundering tool, integrating dirty money into seemingly legitimate wealth. * **Property as camouflage:** Short-term leases of expensive properties in Barangaroo and other high-end districts provided both a lifestyle cover and another channel to absorb illicit funds. * **Gatekeeper loopholes:** Real estate agents, accountants, and luxury dealers in Australia are not yet fully bound by AML/CTF obligations. This gap created the perfect playground for laundering. What’s striking is not the creativity of the scheme—it’s the simplicity. By targeting sectors without AML scrutiny, the syndicate turned everyday transactions into a pipeline for cleaning millions. ## The Regulatory Gap This case lands at a critical time. For years, Australia has been under pressure from the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf) to extend AML/CTF laws to the so-called “gatekeeper professions”—real estate agents, accountants, lawyers, and dealers in high-value goods. As of 2025, these obligations are still not fully in place. The expansion is only scheduled to take effect from July 2026. Until then, large swathes of the economy remain outside [AUSTRAC](https://www.tookitaki.com/blog/austrac-aml-ctf-regulations-guide)’s oversight. The Barangaroo arrests underscore what critics have long warned: criminals don’t wait for legislation. They are already steps ahead, embedding illicit funds into sectors that regulators have yet to fence off. For businesses in real estate, luxury retail, and professional services, this case is more than a headline—it’s a wake-up call to prepare now, not later. ## Why This Case Matters for Australia The Barangaroo case isn’t just about two individuals—it highlights systemic vulnerabilities in the Australian financial ecosystem. 1. **Criminal Adaptation:** Syndicates will always pivot to the weakest link. If banks tighten their checks, criminals move to less regulated industries. 2. **Erosion of Trust:** When high-value markets become conduits for laundering, it damages Australia’s reputation as a clean, well-regulated financial hub. 3. **Compliance Risk:** Businesses in these sectors risk being blindsided by new regulations if they don’t start implementing AML controls now. 4. **Global Implications:** With assets like luxury cars and crypto being easy to move or sell internationally, local failures in AML quickly ripple across borders. This isn’t an isolated story. It’s part of a broader trend where fraud, luxury assets, and regulatory lag intersect to create fertile ground for financial crime. ## Lessons for Businesses For financial institutions, fintechs, and gatekeeper industries, the Barangaroo case offers several practical takeaways: * **Monitor for rapid loan cycling:** Short-term loans repaid unusually fast, or loans tied to sudden high-value purchases, should trigger alerts. * **Scrutinise asset purchases:** Repeated luxury acquisitions, especially where the source of funds is vague, are classic laundering red flags. * **Don’t rely solely on regulation:** Just because AML obligations aren’t mandatory yet doesn’t mean businesses can ignore risk. Voluntary adoption of AML best practices can prevent reputational damage. * **Collaborate cross-sector:** Banks, real estate firms, and luxury dealers must share intelligence. Laundering rarely stays within one sector. * **Prepare for 2026:** When the law expands, regulators will expect not just compliance but also readiness. Being proactive now can avoid penalties later. ## How Tookitaki’s FinCense Can Help The Barangaroo case demonstrates a truth that regulators and compliance teams already know: criminals are fast, and rules often move too slowly. This is where [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), Tookitaki’s AI-powered compliance platform, makes the difference. * **Scenario-based Monitoring** FinCense doesn’t just look for generic suspicious behaviour—it monitors for specific typologies like “rapid loan cycling leading to high-value asset purchases.” These scenarios mirror real-world cases, allowing institutions to spot laundering patterns early. * **Federated Intelligence** FinCense leverages insights from a global compliance community. A laundering method detected in one country can be quickly shared and simulated in others. If the Barangaroo pattern emerged elsewhere, FinCense could help Australian institutions adapt almost immediately. * **Agentic AI for Real-Time Detection** Criminal tactics evolve constantly. FinCense’s Agentic AI ensures models don’t go stale—it adapts to new data, learns continuously, and responds to threats as they arise. That means institutions don’t wait months for rule updates; they act in real time. * **End-to-End Compliance Coverage** From customer onboarding to transaction monitoring and investigation, FinCense provides a unified platform. For banks, this means capturing anomalies at multiple points, not just after funds have already flowed into cars and luxury handbags. The result is a system that doesn’t just tick compliance boxes but actively prevents fraud and laundering—protecting both businesses and Australia’s reputation. ## The Bigger Picture: Trust and Reputation Australia has ambitions to strengthen its role as a regional financial hub. But trust is the currency that underpins global finance. Cases like Barangaroo remind us that even one high-profile lapse can shake investor and customer confidence. With scams and laundering scandals making headlines globally—from Crown Resorts to major online frauds—Australia cannot afford to be reactive. For businesses, the message is clear: compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines, it’s about protecting your licence to operate. Customers and partners expect vigilance, transparency, and accountability. ## Conclusion: A Warning Shot The Barangaroo “ghost cars and luxury laundering” saga is more than a crime story—it’s a preview of what happens when regulation lags and businesses underestimate financial crime risk. With AUSTRAC set to extend AML coverage in 2026, industries like real estate and luxury retail must act now. Waiting until the law forces compliance could mean walking straight into reputational disaster. For financial institutions and businesses alike, the smarter path is to embrace advanced solutions like Tookitaki’s FinCense, which combine scenario-driven intelligence with adaptive AI. Because at the end of the day, Ferraris and Bentleys may be glamorous—but when they’re bought with dirty money, they carry a far higher cost.

Мы попытаемся разобраться с их пагубными последствиями для бизнеса и экономики в целом, а также понять методики, которые корпорации могут использовать, чтобы защитить себя от такой незаконной деятельности. Процесс отмывания денег (ОД) наносит значительный ущерб бизнесу, инвестиционному климату и экономической ситуации в целом. Это существенно **способствует росту преступности и коррупции и вызывает значительное снижение эффективности реального сектора экономики**. В результате эта преступная деятельность проявляется и многими другими последствиями. Масштабы такого противозаконного поведения в глобальном масштабе ошеломляют. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) сообщает, что каждый год от 2 до 5% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП) подвергается отмыванию денег на сумму от 754 миллиардов до 2 триллионов долларов. В юрисдикциях большинства стран **отмывание денег является тяжким преступлением, наказуемым лишением свободы и/или значительным штрафом.** Например, в Соединенных Штатах Америки наказание за соучастие в отмывании денег может быть довольно суровым: это либо штраф размером до 250 000 долларов или лишение свободы сроком до пяти лет. Многие предприятия могут не обращать внимания на реальность того, что их используют для отмывания денег. Несмотря на то, что не все коммерческие организации могут быть привлечены к ответственности за незаконную деятельность, осуществляемую через них, организации, обязанные соблюдать правила по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML), включая банки, должны соответствовать другому стандарту. **Последствия могут быть колоссальными, если противоправное поведение будет обнаружено в процессе аудита.** Например, Danske Bank недавно был оштрафован на 470 миллионов евро (495 миллионов долларов) из-за своего участия в международном скандале с отмыванием денег. Чтобы обезопасить свой бизнес от преступников и наложения нормативных штрафов, необходимо вникнуть в тонкости отмывания денег, включая распространенные схемы, которые обычно используются, и меры, которые можно предпринять для предотвращения этого. ## Что такое отмывание денег (ОД) и почему об этом важно знать Базовое определение процесса отмывания денег характеризуется умышленным сокрытием или искажением источника доходов, полученных незаконным путем, для создания впечатления, что средства были получены из законных источников. **Отмывание денег (ОД) предполагает действия, при которых злоумышленник скрывает источник средств, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности**, такой как незаконный оборот наркотиков, взяточничество или мошенничество. > *Действия по борьбе с отмыванием денег (ОД) часто связаны с борьбой с финансированием терроризма (ФТ), поскольку и ОД, и ФТ влекут за собой перенаправление средств.* Согласно выводам Группы разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ), ежегодно из стран с более низким уровнем дохода отмывается ошеломляющая сумма в 1,6 триллиона долларов, причём доходы, как правило, поступают от политической коррупции. В таких областях **коррупция усугубляет бедность, что ведёт к разрушению окружающей среды и вызывая экономический застой**. Из-за сложной связи между отмыванием денег и коррупцией любые инициативы, направленные на сдерживание распространения незаконных средств, также играют решающую роль в снижении уровня коррупции в глобальном масштабе. Такие виды деятельности, как незаконная продажа оружия, контрабанда и организованная преступность, включая незаконный оборот наркотиков и проституцию, могут приносить значительные суммы денег. Точно так же схемы хищения, инсайдерской торговли, взяточничества и компьютерного мошенничества могут приносить значительную прибыль и создавать стимулы для «узаконивания» доходов, полученных незаконным путём, посредством отмывания денег. Когда преступная деятельность приводит к значительной прибыли, **вовлечённые стороны должны найти способ сохранить контроль над средствами, не привлекая внимания к основной деятельности или причастным лицам**. Преступники делают это, маскируя источник средств, изменяя их форму или перемещая средства в место, где они с меньшей вероятностью привлекут внимание. В свете растущих опасений по поводу отмывания денег на саммите Большой семерки в Париже в 1989 году была создана Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) для выработки согласованного международного ответа. Одной из основных задач ФАТФ была разработка набора из 40 рекомендаций, в которых изложены меры, которые должны принять национальные правительства для реализации эффективных программ по борьбе с отмыванием денег. ## Сколько денег отмывается в год? По самой своей природе отмывание денег — это незаконная деятельность, совершаемая преступниками, которые действуют за пределами стандартных представлений об экономической и финансовой деятельности. В сочетании с другими аспектами скрытой экономической деятельности были предоставлены приблизительные значения, чтобы дать представление о масштабах рассматриваемой проблемы. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) провело всесторонний анализ, чтобы установить размер незаконных средств, полученных от наркотрафика и организованной преступности, и степень отмывания этих средств. В отчёте УНП ООН приблизительно указано, что **в 2009 году преступные доходы составили 3,6% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП)**, при этом 2,7% (что эквивалентно 1,6 триллионам долларов США) этих доходов было отмыто. Это соответствует широко цитируемой оценке Международного валютного фонда (МВФ), согласно которой в 1998 году общий объём отмывания денег в мире может составлять от двух до пяти процентов мирового ВВП. Используя статистику 1998 года, эти проценты позволяют предположить, что феномен отмывания денег колеблется от 590 миллиардов долларов США до 1,5 триллионов долларов США. На тот момент нижняя цифра была примерно соизмерима с общим объёмом производства в экономике, сопоставимой по размеру с экономикой Испании. Однако при рассмотрении приведённых выше оценок необходимо проявлять осторожность. Они просто предназначены для приблизительного определения масштабов отмывания денег. **Из-за тайного характера транзакций точные статистические данные недоступны**, что делает невозможным точную оценку общемирового количества денег, отмываемых каждый год. Поэтому Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) воздерживается от публикации каких-либо данных по этому поводу. ## Три основных этапа отмывания денег ### Этап размещения Незаконные средства могут быть интегрированы в финансовую систему прямо или косвенно. На этапе размещения наиболее распространенным методом является дробление больших сумм денег на более мелкие, менее заметные суммы, которые могут быть депонированы на один или несколько банковских счетов с использованием метода **«смурфинга»**. Компании по обслуживанию денег часто используются для осуществления смурфинга. **Другие методы размещения включают в себя:** * **Ложное выставление счетов-фактур** включает создание счетов-фактур за несуществующие товары или услуги для завышения или взимания платы за услуги, которые никогда не оказывались. Разница между фактической стоимостью товаров или услуг и завышенной суммой затем переводится как отмытые деньги. * **Смешивание незаконных денег с законными деньгами** — включает в себя внесение наличных, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности, на банковские счета с законно заработанными средствами, что затрудняет отслеживание незаконных средств правоохранительными органами. * **Покупка иностранной валюты** — включает в себя конвертацию больших сумм незаконных денег в другую валюту, которую затем можно положить на счета в иностранных банках или использовать для покупки активов в других странах. * **Покупка ценных бумаг или страховки за наличные** — предполагает покупку акций, облигаций или страховых полисов за наличные, которые впоследствии можно продать за чистые деньги. * **Азартные игры и ставки на спортивные события** — могут использоваться для отмывания денег путём размещения ставок за наличные деньги, полученные в результате незаконной деятельности, а затем получения выигрыша в виде чистых денег. ### Этап наслоения Процесс, известный как «наслоение», обозначает сложный набор действий, направленных на выявление незаконного происхождения денег и дальнейшую **маскировку их источника путём создания нескольких «слоёв» транзакций**, чтобы запутать след проверки. Эта изощренная практика служит цели сокрытия происхождения незаконно полученных активов, усложняя их обнаружение и отслеживание. Проведение фазы наслоения представляет собой наиболее сложную стадию этой мошеннической операции. Это влечёт за собой серию сложных финансовых транзакций, которые часто пересекают национальные границы посредством международных денежных переводов. Для реализации стратегии наслоения средства могут быть направлены через покупку и продажу различных типов инвестиций или через цепочку счетов, открытых в разных финансовых учреждениях в разных юрисдикциях. Такой капитал, полученный незаконным путём, часто перенаправляется в страны с разрешительными правилами по борьбе с отмыванием денег (БОД) или в страны, которые не сотрудничают с расследованиями по ПОД. ### Этап интеграции После того как незаконные деньги были успешно размещены и распределены, следующим этапом для преступников является реинтеграция или «возвращение» денег себе таким образом, чтобы скрыть их незаконное происхождение, сделав их «чистыми». По завершении этого этапа средства становятся частью законной финансовой системы и могут свободно использоваться преступниками. Основная цель этого этапа — **интегрировать деньги в экономику, не вызывая подозрений и не привлекая внимания правоохранительных органов**. Для достижения этой цели преступники могут приобретать такие активы, как недвижимость, произведения искусства, драгоценные украшения или дорогие автомобили, среди прочего. Эти виды активов могут служить для узаконивания ранее полученного незаконным путём капитала, поскольку они могут восприниматься как приобретённые законным путём. ## Как отмывание денег влияет на бизнес и экономику Отмывание денег представляет собой серьезную угрозу для бизнеса, что приводит к множеству неблагоприятных последствий, таких как потеря доходов, ущерб репутации и штрафы регулирующих органов на миллионы долларов или приостановление действия лицензий. Кроме того, социально-экономические последствия ОД имеют далеко идущие и разрушительные последствия с масштабным эффектом, таким как укоренение коррупции, эскалация преступной деятельности, подрыв доверия иностранных инвесторов, увеличение неравенства доходов и замедление экономического роста. Эти последствия вызывают особую озабоченность, поскольку они могут **осложнять и усугублять ранее существовавшие экономические и социальные проблемы**, создавая дальнейшую дестабилизацию и причиняя вред. Функционирование рынка банковских и финансовых услуг в рамках повышенных правовых, профессиональных и этических стандартов является неотъемлемой частью сохранения его целостности. Репутация финансового учреждения как честного является одним из его самых ценных активов. Предположим, что конкретное учреждение может обрабатывать средства, полученные в результате преступной деятельности, либо из-за взяточничества его сотрудников или директоров, либо из-за того, что они закрывают глаза на незаконный характер таких средств. В этом случае это **учреждение рискует стать активным соучастником преступников** и тем самым стать частью самой преступной сети. Любые доказательства такого соучастия обязательно навредят восприятию других финансовых посредников и регулирующих органов, помимо обычных клиентов. Неконтролируемое отмывание денег также чревато негативными макроэкономическими последствиями, такими как необъяснимые изменения в спросе на деньги, пруденциальные риски для надёжности банков, влияние “загрязнения” на законные финансовые операции и повышенная волатильность международных потоков капитала и обменных курсов из-за непредвиденных трансграничных переводов активов. Кроме того, успешное отмывание денег вознаграждает коррупцию и преступность, нанося ущерб целостности общества в целом, подрывая демократию и ставя под угрозу верховенство закона. Отмыватели денег постоянно ищут новые способы отмывания своих доходов, полученных нечестным путём. **Экономики с расширяющимися или появляющимися финансовыми центрами, но с недостаточными мерами защиты, особенно уязвимы**, поскольку страны с хорошо зарекомендовавшими себя финансовыми центрами внедряют обширные протоколы по борьбе с отмыванием денег. Отмыватели будут использовать различия в национальных системах борьбы с отмыванием денег, перемещая свои сети в страны и финансовые системы со слабыми или неэффективными мерами противодействия. Кто-то может возразить, что развивающиеся страны не могут быть слишком разборчивыми, когда речь идёт о привлечении капитала. Однако откладывать борьбу с мошенниками рискованно. Чем больше откладываются такие действия, тем более укоренившейся может стать организованная преступность. Подобно нарушению целостности конкретного финансового учреждения, присутствие организованной преступности, контролирующей и влияющей на коммерческий и финансовый сектор страны, **наносит ущерб прямым иностранным инвестициям**. > *Таким образом, борьба с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма имеет решающее значение для создания благоприятной деловой среды, что является необходимым условием устойчивого экономического развития.* Потенциальные социальные и политические последствия неустранённого или плохо управляемого отмывания денег могут быть серьёзными. Организованная преступность может проникнуть в финансовые учреждения, захватить контроль над значительной частью экономики посредством инвестиций или подкупить государственных чиновников и даже правительства. Экономическое и политическое влияние преступных организаций может подорвать общественное устройство, общие этические нормы и, в конечном счёте, демократические институты общества. В странах, переходящих к демократическим системам, криминальное влияние может подорвать этот переход. По своей сути **отмывание денег неразрывно связано с преступной деятельностью**, которая его породила. Благодаря отмыванию средств преступная деятельность может продолжаться. ## Как выявить и предотвратить отмывание денег Для обеспечения безопасности бизнеса и предотвращения финансовых преступлений необходимо внедрить комплексную программу соблюдения требований по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML). Такая программа должна чётко определять процедуры выявления, оценки и сообщения о подозрительной финансовой деятельности. **Следующие меры являются ключевыми компонентами эффективной программы ПОД:** * **Надлежащая проверка клиентов (CDD)**: прежде чем клиенту будет разрешено пользоваться услугами компании, он должен пройти тщательную надлежащую проверку клиентов. Этот процесс включает в себя получение и проверку информации о клиентах, например, их документов, удостоверяющих личность, и оценку того, представляют ли они какой-либо потенциальный риск участия в преступной деятельности. * **Расширенная комплексная проверка (EDD)**: в случаях, когда существует более высокий риск отмывания денег, компании обязаны применять меры расширенной комплексной проверки. Одним из наиболее важных элементов EDD является тщательная проверка источников средств клиентов, чтобы убедиться, что они не получены в результате незаконной деятельности. * **Непрерывный мониторинг клиентов**: это дополнительный уровень управления рисками, который включает в себя постоянный мониторинг транзакций клиентов и проведение периодических проверок для выявления и оценки любых подозрительных действий. * **Независимые аудиты AML:** эти аудиты позволяют предприятиям выявлять и устранять любые недостатки и недочёты в своих стратегиях соблюдения AML до проверок регулирующими органами, чтобы предотвратить санкции или штрафы. * **KYT или мониторинг транзакций:** мониторинг транзакций — это непрерывный процесс обеспечения безопасности, который позволяет компаниям обнаруживать и предотвращать подозрительные транзакции. Надёжная программная платформа KYT может выявлять необычные схемы, тщательно проверять сомнительные переводы и отслеживать транзакции в цифровой или фиатной валюте. Это помогает предотвращать и выявлять отмывание денег и другие финансовые преступления. ## Услуги [АМЛ консалтинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/) [АМЛ поддержка](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-podderzhka/) [AML обучение](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-obuchenie/) [АМЛ аутсорсинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-autsorsing/) [Индивидуальные решения для аудита AML для бизнеса](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-audit/) ОСТАВЬТЕ ЗАЯВКУ И ПОЛУЧИТЕ КОНСУЛЬТАЦИЮ * [Открытие банковских счетов](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/) + [По сферам](#) - [Для финансовых компаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-finansovyh-kompanij/) - [Для физических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-fizicheskih-lic/) - [Для юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-juridicheskih-lic/) - [Для криптокомпаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/otkrytie-schetov-dlja-kriptokompanij/) + [По странам](#) - [Открыть счет в ОАЭ (Дубай)](https://coredo.eu/ru/oaje-dubaj/) - [Открыть счет в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/avstrija/) - [Открыть счет в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/velikobritanija/) - [Открыть счет в Сингапуре](https://coredo.eu/ru/singapur-2/) - [Другие страны](/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/#countries) * [Регистрация юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) + [Разделы](#) - [Регистрация компании в Чехии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-chehii-2/) - [Регистрация компании в Словакии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-slovakii/) - [Регистрация компании на Кипре](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-na-kipre/) - [Регистрация компании в Люксембурге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ljuksemburge/) - [Регистрация компании в Гонконге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-gonkonge/) - [Регистрация компании в Эстонии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-jestonii/) - [Регистрация компании в Греции](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-grecii/) - [Регистрация компании в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-velikobritanii/) - [Регистрация компании в Ирландии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-irlandii/) - [Регистрация компании в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-avstrii/) - [Регистрация компании в Испании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ispanii/) - [Другие страны](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) * [Инструменты для финансовых институтов](#) + [Разделы](#) - [Интернет эквайринг](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/internet-jekvajring/) - [Эмиссия карт](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/jemissija-kart-vypusk-debitovyh-kart/) - [SEPA/SWIFT, IBAN интеграция](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/sepa-swift-iban-integracii/) - [Паспортизация лицензий](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/pasportizacija-licenzij/) - [Программное обеспечение](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/programmnoe-obespechenie/) * [Бухгалтерское обслуживание](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/buhgalterskoe-obsluzhivanie/) * [Компании на продажу](https://coredo.eu/ru/kompanii-na-prodazhu/) * [О компании COREDO](https://coredo.eu/ru/o-kompanii/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Контакты](https://coredo.eu/ru/kontakty/) * [Общие положения и условия](https://coredo.eu/ru/uslovija-i-polozhenija/) * [Политика использования файлов cookie](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-ispolzovanija-fajlov-cookie/) * [Политика конфиденциальности](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-konfidencialnosti/) * [Объявление о политике информирования](https://coredo.eu/ru/obyavlenie-o-politike-informirovaniya-whistleblowing/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Подписаться на новости](#subscribe) * [Информационное предупреждение](https://coredo.eu/ru/informacionnoe-preduprezhdenie/) * [Словарь](https://coredo.eu/ru/dictionary/) [+420 228 886 867](tel:+420 228 886 867 \"Phone\") [info@coredo.eu](mailto:info@coredo.eu \"Email\") K Cervenemu dvoru 3269/25a, Прага, 130 00, Чехия [Карта сайта](https://coredo.eu/ru/karta-sajta/) © 2025 Авторские права ©RES JUDICATA s.r.o.

[ENG](http://din-eka.com/ \"Switch to english version\") Прозрачность и подотчетность - ключевые аспекты современного корпоративного управления ====================================================================================== 07.06.2024 11:50 ![Image 2](https://dineka.ru/upload/medialibrary/6cf/6cfb199dfe2492feb845e128005e447d.png) Многие страны ввели законодательные изменения, направленные на повышение прозрачности корпоративного управления. Эти меры помогают бороться с финансовыми преступлениями, коррупцией и улучшить деловую репутацию компаний на международной арене. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты этих изменений и их влияние на бизнес. ##### Международные изменения в законодательстве * **AMLD в ЕС** Директива Европейского Союза по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AMLD) представляет собой серию мер, направленных на усиление прозрачности и подотчетности. Последние изменения включают требования к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах, создание централизованных регистров и обязательное сообщение о подозрительных транзакциях. Эти меры направлены на предотвращение отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма. * **Законы о корпоративной прозрачности в США** В США Законы о корпоративной прозрачности, такие как Закон о корпоративной прозрачности 2020 года (Corporate Transparency Act), требуют от компаний раскрытия информации о своих конечных бенефициарных владельцах в FinCEN. Это помогает правительственным органам бороться с незаконными финансовыми операциями и повышает уровень корпоративной подотчетности. * **Инициативы G20** Инициативы G20 включают в себя автоматический обмен информацией о финансовых счетах между странами-членами. Это значительно усложняет уклонение от уплаты налогов и способствует более прозрачной и справедливой налоговой системе. Эти меры также включают рекомендации по внедрению стандартов прозрачности и подотчетности на национальном уровне. ##### Международные стандарты и рекомендации Для повышения прозрачности и подотчётности в корпоративном управлении, а также для борьбы с финансовыми преступлениями, на международном уровне были разработаны и внедрены несколько ключевых стандартов и рекомендаций. Рассмотрим их подробнее. * **Директивы FATF** Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (FATF) разрабатывает международные стандарты по борьбе с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. Рекомендации FATF включают требования к идентификации клиентов, мониторингу транзакций и отчетности о подозрительных действиях. * **OECD Guidelines** Руководящие принципы Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (OECD) по корпоративному управлению включают рекомендации по прозрачности, подотчетности и соблюдению этических стандартов. Эти принципы помогают компаниям улучшить свои управленческие практики и повысить доверие со стороны заинтересованных сторон. * **ISO 37001** ISO 37001 — международный стандарт по системам управления антикоррупционной деятельностью, который предоставляет руководство по предотвращению, выявлению и реагированию на коррупцию. Внедрение этого стандарта помогает компаниям минимизировать риски коррупции и повысить уровень корпоративной этики. ##### Новые вызовы для корпоративного управления Компании должны уделять больше внимания процессам проверки и утверждения своих контрагентов. Это связано с усилением требований к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах и топ-менеджерах, которые могут оказывать значительное влияние на деятельность компании. В частности, внимание уделяется следующим аспектам: * Окончательные владельцы (UBO). В законодательстве многих стран усилились требования по раскрытию информации о физических лицах, которые в конечном итоге контролируют компанию. Это помогает бороться с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. * Профессиональные CEO. Компании должны убедиться, что их руководители обладают не только профессиональными навыками, но и соответствуют высоким стандартам этики и подотчётности. * Значимые бенефициары. Необходимо учитывать влияние значимых бенефициаров на стратегические решения компании и обеспечить их прозрачность. ##### Почему это важно? Проверка контрагентов и раскрытие информации о них имеет несколько ключевых преимуществ: * **Снижение рисков.** Компании могут лучше защищаться от финансовых преступлений и коррупции, зная, кто именно контролирует их контрагентов. * **Укрепление репутации.** Прозрачность и подотчётность повышают доверие инвесторов и партнёров. * **Соблюдение законодательства.** Соблюдение международных и национальных требований помогает избежать штрафов и юридических проблем. * **Улучшение бизнес-отношений.** Прозрачные процедуры способствуют укреплению доверия и партнёрских отношений. ##### Санкции за несоблюдение требований Компании, не соблюдающие требования по раскрытию информации и проверке контрагентов, могут столкнуться с серьезными санкциями: * **Финансовые штрафы.** Значительные денежные штрафы, налагаемые регуляторами. * **Юридические последствия.** Судебные разбирательства и уголовные преследования. * **Репутационные потери.** Потеря доверия и деловой репутации. Вот несколько интересных примеров как недостаточные проверки привели к серьёзным потерям: * **Airbnb и незаконная сдача жилья в аренду** В 2020 году компания Airbnb столкнулась с юридическими проблемами в Германии из-за того, что не проверяла легальность сдачи жилья в аренду. Власти Берлина обвинили компанию в том, что она позволяла сдавать квартиры без соответствующих разрешений, что нарушало местные законы о краткосрочной аренде. В результате Airbnb пришлось заплатить значительные штрафы и изменить свои процедуры проверки арендодателей, чтобы соответствовать местным законам. Этот случай подчеркивает важность проверки соответствия контрагентов местным законодательным требованиям. * **Standard Chartered и отмывание денег** В 2019 году банк Standard Chartered был оштрафован на 1,1 миллиарда долларов за нарушение законов о борьбе с отмыванием денег в США и Великобритании. Расследование показало, что банк не проводил достаточную проверку своих клиентов и их транзакций, что позволило преступным организациям отмывать деньги через его счета. Недостаточная проверка привела к финансовым и репутационным потерям для банка и подчеркнула необходимость строгих процедур соблюдения норм по борьбе с отмыванием денег. * **Danske Bank и скандал с отмыванием денег** В 2018 году Danske Bank оказался в центре одного из крупнейших скандалов с отмыванием денег в Европе. Через эстонское подразделение банка прошло около 200 миллиардов евро подозрительных транзакций. В результате банк был оштрафован на сотни миллионов долларов, его руководство подверглось серьезной критике, и банк понес огромные репутационные потери. Расследование показало, что банк не проверял должным образом своих клиентов и не проводил адекватный мониторинг транзакций. * **Volkswagen и нарушение требований по проверке поставщиков** В 2015 году разразился скандал с Volkswagen, когда выяснилось, что компания использовала программное обеспечение для обхода экологических тестов на выбросы. Расследование показало, что компания недостаточно проверяла своих поставщиков и производителей компонентов, что позволило этим нарушениям оставаться незамеченными. Скандал привел к штрафам на миллиарды долларов и нанес серьёзный ущерб репутации компании. ##### Выводы Современные требования к проверке контрагентов и раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах требуют от компаний пересмотра своих внутренних процессов и структур. Прозрачность и подотчётность становятся неотъемлемыми элементами успешного корпоративного управления. Внедрение этих изменений не только поможет компаниям соответствовать законодательным требованиям, но и укрепит их позиции на рынке, повышая доверие со стороны инвесторов и партнёров. Внедрение новых стандартов корпоративного управления и проверок контрагентов играет ключевую роль в глобальной борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями. Более строгие процедуры помогают выявлять и предотвращать попытки отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма (с) Деловой центр \"ДИНЕКА\" Д.Е.

finance, les gatekeepers tels que les comptables et les avocats sont censés se prémunir contre la criminalité financière. Pourtant, ces mêmes acteurs peuvent parfois devenir des partenaires involontaires, voire complices, de systèmes de blanchiment d\\'argent. L\\'expertise qui rend ces professionnels indispensables aux entreprises offre également aux criminels la possibilité de les exploiter dans le cadre d\\'activités illicites. Dans cet article, nous examinerons comment ces intermédiaires peuvent être utilisés pour blanchir des fonds illégaux, la législation relative aux gatekeepers et à la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, ainsi que des exemples concrets d\\'utilisation de ces intermédiaires à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent. Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'un gatekeeper ? ---------------------------- Un **gatekeeper** est une personne ou une entité qui contrôle l\\'accès à quelque chose, agissant souvent comme une barrière ou un filtre entre différentes parties. Dans divers contextes, les gatekeepers ont l\\'autorité ou la responsabilité de réglementer, de gérer ou de contrôler l\\'entrée, la participation ou le flux d\\'informations ou de ressources. ![Image 10: Gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-lawyers.png) Dans le **contexte financier et juridique**, les gatekeepers sont des professionnels tels que des comptables, des avocats, des banquiers, des auditeurs et d\\'autres experts chargés de garantir l\\'intégrité et la légalité des transactions et des activités financières. Quelles sont les tâches des gatekeepers dans le cadre de la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent ? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Le rôle du [gatekeeper dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux](https://febelfin.be/media/pages/publicaties/2021/banken-gatekeepers-in-de-strijd-tegen-witwassen/23291479c0-1694763198/brochure_aml_en.pdf)implique un devoir de vigilance permanent tout au long de la relation d\\'affaires : * 1 **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Comprendre parfaitement l\\'identité et les antécédents du client. Cela se fait généralement lors de l\\'onboarding de nouveaux clients, afin de s\\'assurer que leurs activités sont conformes aux normes juridiques et éthiques. * 2 **Know Your Transaction (KYT)**: Contrôler et comprendre la nature des transactions du client. Le KYT permet d\\'identifier les transactions suspectes ou inhabituelles qui peuvent indiquer une activité illicite, telle que le blanchiment d\\'argent, en signalant les incohérences par rapport au comportement attendu. * 3 **Vérifier l\\'origine des actifs**: S\\'assurer que les actifs impliqués dans les transactions proviennent de sources légitimes. Cela devient particulièrement important lorsque les transactions ou les transferts d\\'actifs d\\'un client sont anormaux ou ne correspondent pas à ses antécédents financiers. * 4 **Risk-Based Approach**: mise en oeuvre de mesures fondées sur le niveau de risque associé à chaque client et à chaque transaction. Les clients ou les transactions considérés comme présentant un risque plus élevé, tels que ceux impliquant des transferts de grande valeur ou des [personnes politiquement exposées (PPE)](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/personne-politiquement-expos%C3%A9e-ppe/), font l\\'objet d\\'une vigilance accrue, tandis que les clients présentant un risque moins élevé peuvent faire l\\'objet de contrôles moins stricts. * 5 **Respecter les embargos financiers**: Respecter les restrictions légales sur les transactions financières avec certaines entités ou certains pays. La conformité est essentielle pour éviter les sanctions et empêcher la facilitation des transactions illicites. * 6 **Limiter l\\'utilisation de l\\'argent liquide**: La limitation des transactions en espèces est une mesure essentielle dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, car l\\'argent liquide est difficile à retracer et est couramment utilisé dans les activités illicites. * 7 **Obligations de déclaration**: Les professionnels désignés sont légalement tenus de signaler aux autorités compétentes, telles que la cellule de renseignement financier (CRF) locale, toute activité suspecte susceptible d\\'indiquer un blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'autres délits financiers. * 8 **Conformité et adaptation continue**: Les gatekeepers doivent se tenir au courant des best practices, réviser les protocoles internes et s\\'assurer qu\\'ils sont bien formés pour reconnaître et traiter les risques liés au blanchiment d\\'argent et à la criminalité financière. Comment les gatekeepers sont-ils utilisés pour le blanchiment d\\'argent ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Les gatekeepers sont utilisés de diverses manières pour contribuer au blanchiment d\\'argent pour le compte de criminels. En voici quelques exemples : **Rôle des professionnels du domaine légal** **Création de sociétés écrans**: Les avocats sont souvent utilisés pour créer des sociétés écrans et des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui dissimulent la propriété et l\\'origine des fonds. Les avocats peuvent concevoir des structures de sociétés à plusieurs niveaux avec des entités dans différentes juridictions, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux d\\'argent ou d\\'identifier les véritables propriétaires. [![Image 11: Gatekeepers and shell companies](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg) **Transactions immobilières**: Les avocats jouent un rôle essentiel dans l\\'[organisation des transactions immobilières](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/comment-blanchir-argent-de-immobilier-aml/), la gestion des contrats et le respect des exigences légales et réglementaires. Les criminels exploitent souvent cette possibilité en achetant des propriétés de grande valeur avec de l\\'argent blanchi, ce qui leur permet d\\'intégrer ces fonds illicites dans l\\'économie légitime. [![Image 12: Gatekeepers and real estate](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg) **Rôle des comptables et des auditeurs** **Manipulation des états financiers**: Les comptables peuvent se livrer à des activités frauduleuses en falsifiant les documents financiers pour masquer la véritable nature des fonds. Ils peuvent gonfler les chiffres d\\'affaires en créant de fausses transactions commerciales, en émettant de fausses factures ou en enregistrant des ventes inexistantes afin de donner une fausse image de la santé financière d\\'une entreprise. En outre, ils peuvent manipuler les flux de revenus en fabriquant des revenus provenant de produits ou de services inexistants. [![Image 13: Gatekeepers and financial statement manipulation](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg) **Les stratagèmes d\\'évasion fiscale**: Les comptables peuvent s\\'engager dans des pratiques telles que la fabrication de dépenses et la sous-déclaration de revenus pour créer un profil financier trompeur. Cette manipulation permet non seulement [de réduire les obligations fiscales](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-and-crime.html), mais contribue également à la mise en place d\\'une structure complexe qui rend de plus en plus difficile l\\'identification de la véritable source des fonds. [![Image 14: Gatekeepers and illegal tax schemes](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg) Quels sont les exemples d\\'utilisation de gatekeepers à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent ? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au Canada, plusieurs avocats ont été impliqués dans des affaires de blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'activités financières suspectes, mettant en évidence leur rôle involontaire ou délibéré dans la facilitation d\\'opérations criminelles. Parmi les cas les plus marquants, on peut citer : * **Simon Rosenfeld**, un avocat de Toronto qui a [été condamné en 2005](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/5-canadian-lawyers-accused-of-money-laundering-or-suspicious-financial-transactions-1.6942083) après s\\'être vanté auprès d\\'un agent infiltré du laxisme du Canada en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. Sa peine a été alourdie en appel. * **Florence Yen**, une avocate spécialisée dans l\\'immobilier à Vancouver, qui a été suspendue pendant trois mois en 2021 pour avoir manipulé plus de 14 millions de dollars provenant d\\'un client sans fournir de services juridiques ni enquêter sur l\\'origine des fonds. * **Ronald Pelletier**, radié du barreau en 2023, pour avoir déplacé 31 millions de dollars pour le compte de clients impliqués dans des fraudes boursières aux États-Unis, en utilisant des téléphones à mémoire cachée pour dissimuler ses activités. En Europe, le [scandale de la Danske Bank en 2018](https://www.euronews.com/2022/12/14/danske-bank-fined-470m-over-international-money-laundering-scandal) est un cas bien connu d\\'avocats ayant permis le blanchiment d\\'argent. Ce scandale a révélé le rôle des professionnels, y compris des avocats, dans la facilitation du blanchiment d\\'environ 200 milliards d\\'euros de fonds suspects par l\\'intermédiaire de la succursale estonienne de la banque entre 2007 et 2015. Les avocats ont abusé du contrôle réglementaire indulgent de l\\'Estonie et ont créé des sociétés écrans avec des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui impliquaient des transactions transfrontalières. Quelle est la réglementation en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les gatekeepers ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La législation visant à réglementer les gatekeepers comprend des dispositions qui exigent de ces professionnels qu\\'ils mettent en oeuvre de solides mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux (AML) et qu\\'ils signalent les activités suspectes. Voici quelques cadres législatifs et mesures clés : **Union européenne** ![Image 15: EU AML directive gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-europe-eu.png) L\\'[Union européenne a adopté plusieurs directives](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/eu-directives-anti-blanchiment/) (e.g. la 4e et 5e directive AML) qui fixent des exigences en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les personnes chargées du contrôle et d\\'autres professionnels. Il s\\'agit notamment d\\'obligations en matière d\\'évaluation des risques, de vigilance à l\\'égard des clients et de déclaration des transactions suspectes. Les gatekeepers jouent un rôle essentiel en veillant à ce que les entreprises tiennent des registres précis de leurs structures de propriété. Ils sont chargés de faciliter le respect des réglementations qui exigent que ces informations sur la propriété soient accessibles aux autorités compétentes et aux entités obligées. La cinquième directive anti-blanchiment souligne encore cette responsabilité en exigeant que les informations relatives à la propriété soient mises à la disposition des personnes et des entités ayant un intérêt légitime. **États-Unis d\\'Amérique** Le Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) exige des entités de contrôle qu\\'elles établissent et maintiennent des programmes efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, qu\\'elles fassent preuve de diligence à l\\'égard des clients, qu\\'elles établissent des déclarations sur les activités suspectes (SAR) et qu\\'elles se conforment à d\\'autres exigences en matière de rapports. La loi prévoit également des sanctions en cas de non-respect de ces obligations. Les gatekeepers sont également tenus d\\'établir un rapport sur les transactions en devises (CTR) pour tout dépôt, retrait, échange de devises ou autre paiement ou transfert impliquant plus de $10.000 en espèces ou plus au cours d\\'une même journée. ![Image 16: Currency transaction reports for gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-transactions.png) Il existe également la [Gatekeeper Initiative](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminaljustice/gatekeeper_faq.pdf), une initiative gouvernementale visant à imposer des exigences strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent et le financement du terrorisme aux principaux professionnels qui agissent en tant que gatekeepers des systèmes financiers nationaux et internationaux. **Groupe d\\'action financière (GAFI)** Le GAFI reconnaît le rôle essentiel que jouent les gatekeepers dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Il encourage les pays à appliquer ses recommandations concernant les gatekeepers dans le cadre de leurs lois et réglementations nationales, afin de renforcer le cadre général de la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Dans l\\'[examen horizontal de la conformité technique des entités de contrôle en matière de corruption](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/Gatekeeper-TC-Corruption.html) réalisé en 2024, il a été noté que si de nombreux membres du GAFI ont obtenu un score supérieur à 80 % en ce qui concerne l\\'application des recommandations du GAFI sur les entités de contrôle, sept grandes économies - représentant plus de la moitié du PIB mondial - ont obtenu un score inférieur à 50 %. Des obligations essentielles telles que le devoir de vigilance à l\\'égard de la clientèle restent faibles. Il est nécessaire de maintenir un contrôle et un équilibre sur les gatekeepers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Les gatekeepers sont essentiels au système financier, et leur rôle et expertise peuvent être exploités par les blanchisseurs d\\'argent pour intégrer, superposer et finalement légitimer des fonds illicites. C\\'est pourquoi il est essentiel d\\'imposer à ces professionnels des obligations strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. ![Image 17: Gatekeepers and KYC](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-kyc.png) Des mesures efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, notamment des procédures de connaissance du client (KYC), le suivi des transactions et la déclaration des activités suspectes, permettent de s\\'assurer que les gatekeepers constituent une barrière plutôt qu\\'un canal pour les activités de blanchiment d\\'argent. Pour empêcher les gatekeepers de faciliter le blanchiment de capitaux, il faut adopter une approche globale impliquant l\\'application de la réglementation, des contrôles internes rigoureux et une surveillance proactive. En mettant en oeuvre ces stratégies, nous pouvons renforcer les défenses du système financier contre le blanchiment de capitaux et veiller à ce que les gatekeepers remplissent leur rôle essentiel dans la prévention de la criminalité financière.

Alors que les régulateurs financiers du monde entier ne cessent de souligner l'importance des protocoles AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CRS (Common Reporting Standard) et FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), certaines institutions commettent des erreurs, intentionnelles ou non, et s'exposent à des conséquences bien plus terrifiantes que prévu. Ces réglementations sont conçues pour assurer la sécurité, la transparence et la résistance du secteur financier aux activités illicites telles que le blanchiment d'argent, l'évasion fiscale et le financement du terrorisme. Cependant, la non-conformité entraîne souvent de lourdes sanctions pécuniaires, des perturbations opérationnelles et le spectre effrayant de la ruine de la réputation. Ce billet explore quelques-uns des exemples les plus alarmants d'institutions hantées par les coûts « effrayants » des manquements à la conformité et explique pourquoi le fait de donner la priorité au respect de la réglementation peut vous éviter une frayeur inattendue. ### Violations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent (LAB) constituent la première défense du secteur financier contre le blanchiment d'argent, le financement du terrorisme et d'autres activités économiques criminelles. Les réglementations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent obligent les institutions financières à mettre en œuvre des procédures rigoureuses, notamment des protocoles de connaissance du client (KYC), des systèmes de surveillance et des rapports sur les activités suspectes. En appliquant ces réglementations, des autorités comme le FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) aux États-Unis et divers régulateurs financiers européens visent à empêcher les criminels d'intégrer des fonds illicites dans le système financier légitime. Pourtant, malgré ces protocoles stricts, de nombreuses institutions ont connu des défaillances qui leur ont coûté cher en termes de finances et de réputation. Certaines des amendes les plus célèbres du secteur en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent rappellent ce qui peut se produire lorsque la diligence raisonnable n'est pas respectée. #### 1. HSBC – Un rappel de 1,9 milliard de dollars sur la négligence en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Dans le cadre de l'une des plus importantes amendes infligées en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, HSBC a été condamnée en 2012 à une pénalité stupéfiante de 1,9 milliard de dollars pour avoir enfreint les lois relatives à la lutte contre le blanchiment. Elle n'avait notamment pas mis en place de contrôles efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et avait traité des transactions pour des cartels de la drogue au Mexique et d'autres clients à haut risque. Le ministère américain de la justice, en collaboration avec le FinCEN et d'autres agences, a mené l'enquête, qui a mis au jour de graves lacunes en matière de diligence raisonnable à l'égard des clients, des contrôles internes inadéquats et des systèmes de surveillance médiocres. La négligence de HSBC a permis à des criminels de faire transiter des milliards de dollars par ses systèmes sans éveiller de soupçons. Les conséquences ont été terribles pour HSBC. Outre le coup financier, l'institution a dû faire face à une surveillance publique intense, à des batailles juridiques et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Elle a été contrainte de revoir ses procédures de conformité, d'investir des millions dans des technologies de conformité et d'embaucher des milliers de responsables de la conformité. Le nom de la banque, autrefois synonyme de fiabilité, a été associé à l'un des plus grands scandales de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent du secteur - une réputation obsédante qui a perduré longtemps après la sanction. #### 2. Danske Bank – Une toile de milliards blanchis Le scandale de blanchiment d'argent de la Danske Bank est un autre exemple notoire. Entre 2007 et 2015, la succursale estonienne de Danske aurait blanchi environ 230 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes, provenant principalement de clients russes. Bien que le scandale ait été rendu public en 2018, l'amende infligée par les régulateurs danois a rappelé le coût élevé des défaillances en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent. L'enquête a révélé que la banque ne disposait pas de contrôles suffisants, ce qui a permis à un réseau de criminels d'exploiter ses systèmes pour effectuer des transactions illicites. Les autorités de régulation danoises et estoniennes, ainsi que plusieurs organismes internationaux, ont jugé que la banque était complice de l'un des plus grands systèmes de blanchiment d'argent en Europe. Les répercussions ne se sont pas limitées à des amendes ; la Danske Bank a dû faire face à des poursuites judiciaires, à la contestation des actionnaires et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Des cadres supérieurs ont démissionné et la réputation de la banque a été fortement entamée, jetant une longue ombre sur ses opérations et ses relations avec les clients. Ce scandale a mis en évidence les dangers liés à la faiblesse des systèmes de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, illustrant comment le non-respect des protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent peut entraîner des dommages financiers et des atteintes à la réputation considérables. #### Analyse des manquements à la conformité : Les pièges courants de la lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les exemples de HSBC et de Danske Bank mettent en évidence les pièges les plus courants en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent : - Diligence insuffisante à l'égard des clients : Des clients insuffisamment contrôlés peuvent exploiter les systèmes financiers à des fins de blanchiment d'argent. - Faiblesse des contrôles internes : L'absence de cadres solides de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et de gestion des risques expose les institutions à l'exploitation criminelle. - Systèmes de surveillance inefficaces : En l'absence de suivi des transactions en temps réel et de détection des anomalies, les activités suspectes peuvent passer inaperçues. Dans les deux cas, l'absence de mesures de conformité et l'absence d'une culture de la conformité ont amplifié l'impact. Lorsque les institutions négligent le respect de la réglementation, elles s'exposent involontairement à des amendes substantielles et à des poursuites judiciaires. ### Sanctions et montages offshore La conformité financière est semée d'embûches coûteuses, en particulier en ce qui concerne les violations des sanctions et l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger. Les sanctions pour non-conformité dans ces domaines sont parmi les plus sévères, car les organismes de réglementation du monde entier appliquent des sanctions strictes pour dissuader les institutions financières de contourner les lois économiques ou de soutenir des activités illicites. Les sanctions américaines jouent un rôle essentiel dans la sauvegarde de la sécurité nationale en limitant les transactions financières avec les pays impliqués dans le terrorisme ou les violations des droits de l'homme. Les banques qui ignorent ou tentent de contourner ces restrictions s'exposent à de graves conséquences économiques et à des atteintes à leur réputation. #### 3. BNP Paribas - Une pénalité record de 8,9 milliards de dollars pour violation des sanctions En 2014, BNP Paribas (BNPP), l'une des plus grandes institutions financières françaises, a reçu une amende record de 8,9 milliards de dollars après avoir plaidé coupable d'avoir traité des transactions pour le Soudan, l'Iran et Cuba, des pays soumis à des sanctions américaines strictes. Cette amende massive a mis en lumière les conséquences de la conspiration pluriannuelle de la BNPP visant à contourner les lois américaines sur les sanctions et les stratagèmes élaborés par la banque pour éviter d'être détectée.La BNPP a utilisé des « banques satellites » et des entités sanctionnées déguisées dans des transactions pour contourner les sanctions, faisant transiter plus de 8,8 milliards de dollars par le système américain. Malgré les avertissements juridiques, la banque a poursuivi ces pratiques à des fins lucratives, notamment en soutenant des banques soudanaises liées au terrorisme. Cette situation a eu des répercussions importantes, notamment des amendes imposées par le ministère de la justice, la Réserve fédérale et l'OFAC, des poursuites pénales et une suspension d'un an des opérations de compensation en dollars. La BNPP a également dû licencier des cadres supérieurs et investir massivement dans des réformes de conformité. #### 4. Credit Suisse - Systèmes d'évasion fiscale offshore et pénalité de 1,8 milliard de dollars Le Crédit Suisse, une banque suisse à l'histoire mouvementée, a été impliqué dans l'aide apportée à des contribuables américains pour leur permettre d'échapper à l'impôt en dissimulant des actifs sur des comptes offshore. En 2014, la banque a plaidé coupable à une accusation de complot pour avoir aidé des clients américains à dissimuler leur fortune, ce qui lui a valu une amende de 1,8 milliard de dollars. Cette affaire a relancé l'examen mondial du rôle des banques suisses dans la facilitation de l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger et de l'efficacité des accords de plaidoyer pour prévenir les violations répétées.Un rapport de la commission des finances du Sénat a révélé que le Crédit suisse n'avait peut-être pas respecté l'accord qu'il avait conclu, en mettant en évidence les services qu'il avait rendus à des personnalités de premier plan comme Dan Horsky, qui avait dissimulé 220 millions de dollars par l'intermédiaire de membres de sa famille et de sociétés écrans. Des documents internes montrent que des banquiers chevronnés ont modifié les détails des comptes pour échapper à la surveillance de l'IRS en utilisant la double nationalité pour masquer l'identité des clients. Le rapport a également mis au jour des comptes non divulgués transférés vers d'autres banques, ce qui a suscité des appels en faveur d'une intensification des enquêtes sur le Credit Suisse et d'autres banques suisses. Ces révélations ont entaché la réputation du Credit Suisse et relancé la demande d'une application plus stricte de la FATCA et de la réglementation sur les déclarations à l'étranger, notamment en ce qui concerne les comptes à double nationalité et l'évasion fiscale. #### Les défis de la conformité : Pourquoi les institutions se débattent-elles avec les sanctions et les réglementations offshore ? La conformité aux sanctions et aux réglementations offshore est complexe pour les institutions financières, car elle exige des contrôles, une surveillance et des rapports rigoureux. Les défis à relever sont les suivants :- Contrôle des transactions : Un contrôle efficace est nécessaire pour empêcher les fonds d'atteindre les entités figurant sur la liste noire. Les tactiques de dissimulation de BNP Paribas mettent en évidence les risques de détection des pratiques occultes.- Questions relatives aux données sur les clients : La conformité offshore nécessite une identification précise des clients, en particulier pour les personnes ayant une double nationalité. La situation du Crédit Suisse a révélé des problèmes liés à une déclaration inadéquate de ces comptes.- Coordination transfrontalière : Les institutions doivent s'aligner sur les différentes réglementations mondiales et locales, comme l'a montré le Credit Suisse en gérant les protocoles de conformité entre les différentes juridictions.Les sanctions infligées à BNP Paribas et au Crédit Suisse montrent les graves conséquences des manquements à la conformité, et soulignent la nécessité d'une approche proactive de la conformité pour atténuer les risques financiers et les risques pour la réputation. ### Conclusion #### Éviter les coûts effrayants des violations de la conformité Les amendes faramineuses et les atteintes à la réputation constatées dans des affaires comme celles de HSBC, Danske Bank, BNP Paribas et Credit Suisse révèlent les enjeux considérables de la conformité financière. Ces histoires édifiantes rappellent aux institutions que les manquements en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, de sanctions ou de réglementations offshore sont coûteux et laissent une ombre durable sur la crédibilité d'une institution et la confiance de ses clients. Avec l'augmentation de la surveillance réglementaire et de la responsabilité publique, la conformité ne peut plus être considérée comme une simple fonction d'arrière-guichet - c'est un élément vital de l'intégrité opérationnelle et de la réussite stratégique.Les institutions financières doivent donner la priorité à des cadres de conformité rigoureux, investir dans des systèmes de contrôle de pointe et instaurer une culture de la responsabilité dans l'ensemble de leurs opérations. Ces mesures proactives sont essentielles pour éviter les conséquences « effrayantes » qui ont hanté d'autres acteurs du secteur. En s'engageant à respecter scrupuleusement les règles de conformité, les institutions se protègent contre de graves répercussions financières et juridiques et préservent leur réputation sur un marché mondial où la confiance et la transparence sont indispensables. #### Share: ### TWC Staff ### Related News [Conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/conformité) ### [08 | Simplifier la conformité dans les îles Caïmans](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [Article](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/article) ### [Fortnite: les achats dans le jeu et les violations de la vie privée entraînent des amendes massives](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [Blog](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/blog) ### [Briser les barrières : les femmes qui ouvrent la voie dans le domaine de la conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr)\", summary=\"Danske Bank was involved in a major money laundering scandal, where its Estonian branch allegedly laundered approximately $230 billion in suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015, mainly from Russian clients.

Так, легализация доходов от краж составила ₽120 млрд, от коррупционных преступлений — ₽60 млрд, от преступлений в сфере компьютерной информации — ₽5,2 млрд, а от грабежей — ₽4,6 млрд.

При этом если «красный клиент» не добьется пересмотра решения, обратившись в банк, межведомственную комиссию или суд, то кредитная организация обязана в течение 6 месяцев расторгнуть договор банковского счета (вклада).

Предлагаемый законопроектом механизм изъятия денежных средств во внесудебном порядке «не соответствует Конституции РФ и гражданскому законодательству», говорится в отзыве Счетной палаты. «Согласно статье 35 Конституции РФ никто не может быть лишен своего имущества иначе как по решению суда», - напоминает СП. При этом проект допускает возможность судебного обжалования решение об отнесении клиента к «красной зоне» только после обращения в межведомственную комиссию. Счетная палата предлагает рассмотреть возможность решения таких споров как в административном, так и в судебном порядке, что «в большей степени соответствует конституционным принципам права на защиту», говорится в отзыве. В пояснительной записке к законопроекту отмечается, что доля клиентов высокого риска у банков составляет 0,7%. По данным [ФНС РФ](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%9D%D0%A1_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ФНС РФ\"), на начало 2020 года всего в РФ было зарегистрировано 3,715 млн юрлиц и 4,014 млн индивидуальных предпринимателей.

Впервые в список сомнительных вошли операции, связанные с оборотом цифровой валюты. Кроме того, сомнительными признаны регулярные зачисления средств от третьих лиц с последующим обналичиванием. Из перечня признаков сомнительных операций были исключены нестандартные и необычно сложные инструкции по проведению расчетов, отказ от более выгодных условий оказания услуг и предложение высокой комиссии при оказании услуг. Кроме того, Центробанк теперь не считает сомнительной операцию, когда клиент осуществляет транзакцию через представителя, не вступающего с банком в личный контакт. ### 2020 #### Сокращение объема незаконного обналичивания на 32 млрд рублей Объем незаконного обналичивания средств в российских [банках](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8,_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82 \"Финансовые услуги, инвестиции и аудит\") по итогам 2020 года сократился на 32 млрд [рублей](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8C \"Российский рубль\") — до 78 млрд рублей с 110 млрд рублей в 2019-м. Об этом сообщил заместитель председателя правления [ЦБ РФ](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%91_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ЦБ РФ\") [Дмитрий Скобелкин](/index.php/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0:%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 \"Скобелкин Дмитрий Германович\"). Он назвал этот спад «неплохим показателем», учитывая, что в условиях пандемии коронавируса [[COVID-19] вопрос незаконного обналичивания средств «стоял и стоит достаточно остро». Замглавы Банка [России](/index.php/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Россия\") обратил внимание, что в 2020 году россияне активно снимали наличные деньги, чем пользовались и обнальщики. Однако, как подчеркнул Скобелкин, [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") в целом справились с ситуацией. Объем незаконного обналичивания в 2020 году сократился на 32 млрд рублей По словам Скобелкина, объем сомнительных транзитных операций в банках в 2020 году снизился до 600 млрд рублей со 720 млрд рублей годом ранее. Незаконный вывод денег за рубеж через российские кредитные организации уменьшился на 21,2% — до 52 млрд рублей с 66 млрд рублей. Согласно статистике, которую привел зампред Центробанка, правоохранительные органы возбудили более 20 крупных уголовных дел на основании сообщений, которые банки отправляли в финансовую разведку. Как сообщили в ЦБ РФ, в 2020 году в России зарегистрировано несколько новых схем обналичивания средств. Так, мошенники стали активно использовать схемы с исполнительными листами и с депозитными счетами нотариусов. По данным регулятора, на них пришлось более 40% операций по обналичиванию через счета физлиц. В случае со схемой с исполнительными документами иностранная компания-пустышка взыскивает через суд фиктивный долг с российской фирмы (иногда с заблокированным за сомнительные операции счетом) и тем самым добивается «чистоты» происхождения средств - деньги переводятся не напрямую из компании в компанию, а через службу судебных приставов. В модификации этой схемы, которую стали использовать обнальщики, одной из сторон выступает физлицо. Банки при этом не имеют права препятствовать исполнению решений суда.[[5]](#cite_note-4) #### Принят закон, уточняющий схему работы банков с клиентами в рамках \"антиотмывочных\" норм [Госдума РФ](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"Госдума РФ\") в декабре 2020 года приняла закон, который уточняет схему работы банков с клиентами при наличии подозрений, связанных с действием \"антиотмывочного\" законодательства (ФЗ-115). Документ (N948530-7) был внесен в парламент правительством в конце апреля. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | | Как пояснял ранее замминистра финансов Алексей Моисеев, поправки исключают возможность злоупотребления со стороны банков при использовании и отказе в открытии счетов со ссылкой на 115 федеральный закон. \"В частности, предусматривается, что непредставление в кредитную организацию документа, который предназначен для фиксации информации в соответствии с положениями данного закона, не будет являться основанием для принятия решения об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, либо отказе в выполнении распоряжении клиента о совершении операции с денежными средствами или имуществом\", — сказал замминистра. | | Предусматривается информирование клиента об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, предоставление причины такого отказа, также устанавливается срок для информирования о принятии данного решения: 5 дней. Решение об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета или о его расторжении принимается руководителем кредитной организации или специально уполномоченными им лицами. Сокращается с 10 до 7 дней срок, в течение которого организация обязана сообщить клиенту об устранении оснований, в соответствии с которыми ранее было принято решение об отказе от проведения операции или об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета. #### Власти Чехии арестовали $13 млн, поступившие от российского ИТ-дистрибутора Как стало известно TAdviser, власти [Чехии](/index.php/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Чехия\") по подозрению в отмывании арестовали $13,3 млн, поступившие местной компании Bardet от российского импортера ИТ-оборудования «Техтраст».

Росфинмониторинг отнёс к зонам риска сферы, связанные производством и продажей продукции медицинского назначения, а также распределение бюджетных средств, выделенных государством на поддержку бизнеса и населения. Кроме того, в ведомстве указали на возможное использование схем незаконного обналичивания в условиях в следующих случаях: Росфинмониторинг добавил новые основания для блокировки счетов * создание и расширение инфраструктуры для охраны жизни и здоровья граждан; * онлайн-платформы и услуги, связанные с пандемией; * оборот драгметаллов и драгоценных камней; * вывод денег на счета других фирм перед банкротством юрлиц с целью уклонения от уплаты долгов и налогов; * снижение наличного оборота в отраслях повышенного спроса. По данным федеральной службы, аналогичные риски опубликовала и международная Группа разработки мер по борьбе с отмыванием денег (FATF). В их докладе также упоминается о росте мошенничеств при реализации программ помощи и экономического стимулирования, о махинациях в благотворительной деятельности, а также о возрастании рисков коррупции из фондов чрезвычайных и непредвиденных расходов через обход стандартных процедур закупок.[[7]](#cite_note-6) В группе «[Тинькофф](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F:%D0%A2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%84%D1%84 \"Тинькофф\")» сообщили [«Известиям»](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Известия\"), что одна из сфер, которая сейчас требует повышенного контроля — это мошеннический бизнес в интернете.

В рамках урегулирования дела кредитная организация выплатит штраф на общую сумму более $3 млрд.

Это на 6% больше по сравнению с 2022-м, когда затраты оценивались в $13,52 млрд. Обзор отрасли приводится в материалах Market Research Future, обнародованных в начале сентября 2024 года. Авторы исследования выделяют несколько ключевых факторов, способствующих росту спроса на цифровые решения для борьбы с отмыванием денег. Один из них — технологические достижения, включая внедрение [искусственного интеллекта](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\") и [машинного обучения](/index.php/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5 \"Машинное обучение\"). Эти инструменты позволяют более эффективно выявлять и предотвращать деятельность по отмыванию денег. [ИИ](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\")-алгоритмы способны анализировать огромные массивы данных, выявлять подозрительные закономерности и автоматизировать рутинные процессы. Развитие отрасли также стимулируется благодаря развертыванию облачных решений, обеспечивающих многочисленные преимущества, такие как масштабируемость, более низкая стоимость, гибкое управление рисками, уменьшенное время развертывания и оперативное обновление. Плюс к этому ужесточается контроль над финансовым сектором со стороны регулирующих органов, что требует повышения безопасности.

Рост масштабов авиаконтрабанды связан с тем, что [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") усилили мониторинг подозрительных транзакций после скандалов с отмыванием денег. Как сообщает газета [The Wall Street Journal](/index.php/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\"), наличные транспортируются на самолетах в обычных чемоданах. В частности, упомянут случай 2020 года, когда из лондонского аэропорта Хитроу в Дубай были перевезены семь чемоданов с деньгами. Их владельцы после прибытия в [ОАЭ](/index.php/%D0%9E%D0%90%D0%AD \"ОАЭ\") задекларировали, что ввозят эквивалент $2,8 млн. Никакие меры в отношении них предприняты не были. [Фото: Unsplash](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Convertkit-5SWgIJSsVJo-unsplash.jpg) Через международные аэропорты пассажиры ежегодно провозят сотни миллиардов долларов наличными Объемы авиаконтрабанды растут по нескольким причинам. Одна из них заключается в том, что 3D-сканеры в аэропортах обследуют багаж только на предмет наличия взрывчатых веществ и других потенциально опасных изделий. Большинство аэропортов по всему миру, в том числе в [США](/index.php/%D0%A1%D0%A8%D0%90 \"США\"), не сканируют багаж на наличные деньги, поскольку это весьма затратная процедура с точки зрения оборудования и персонала. Кроме того, некоторые [государства](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE \"Государство\") вообще не ограничивают ввоз наличных: в частности, в ОАЭ можно ввезти любую сумму при условии, что она задекларирована. Существующие лазейки, как утверждается, позволяют миллиардам долларов утекать из [Британии](/index.php/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Великобритания\") и других стран в государства с меньшим контролем. Старший следователь Национального агентства по борьбе с преступностью Британии Ян Труби (Ian Truby) говорит, что основной задачей службы безопасности аэропортов является обеспечение безопасности полетов, а не выявление преступлений. А поэтому контрабандная перевозка наличных средств на авиалайнерах набирает обороты. Во многих таких схемах задействованы курьеры, а не сами владельцы денег.[[9]](#cite_note-8) #### В США приговорили к уже отбытому сроку россиянина, обвиняемого в отмывании заработанных на кибератаках денег Обвиняемого в отмывании денег через киберпреступников россиянина Дениса Дубникова суд Портленда (Орегон) приговорил к уже отбытому сроку заключения и штрафу на $10 тыс.

В докладе отмечается, что таких преступлений немного по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денежных средств. Подробнее [здесь](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D1%81_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B9 \"Мошенничество с криптовалютой\"). #### Криптовалюта оказалась не самым популярным способом отмывания краденых денег Несмотря на то, что [криптовалюта](/index.php/%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B0 \"Криптовалюта\") считается очень популярной у [киберпреступников](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Киберпреступников\"), в отмывании средств, похищенных в результате [кибератак](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA \"Кибератак\") на [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\"), она играет очень незначительную роль. Об этом сообщается в отчете финансовой организации [SWIFT](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:SWIFT \"SWIFT\"), опубликованном в начале сентября 2020 года[[10]](#cite_note-9)[[11]](#cite_note-10). Согласно отчету, случаи отмывания [хакерами](/index.php/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8 \"Хакерами\") похищенных денег через [криптовалюту](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") встречаются очень редко. Количество выявленных случаев отмывания средств через криптовалюту остается сравнительно небольшим по сравнению с суммами, отмываемыми традиционными способами – с помощью «денежных мулов», подставных компаний и инвестиций в другие виды преступной деятельности (наркоторговлю, торговлю людьми и пр.). В качестве примера использования [криптовалюты](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") для отмывания денег в отчете SWIFT приведено дело об одной из киберпреступных группировок, занимающихся атаками на банкоматы. Хотя популярным способом отмывания похищенных средств у таких группировок является покупка и перепродажа дорогостоящих товаров, киберпреступники конвертировали похищенную из банкоматов «наличку» в криптовалюту. Еще одним примером является восточноевропейская группировка, запустившая собственную криптоферму в Восточной [Азии](/index.php/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Азия\"). Киберпреступники использовали похищенные у банков средства для финансирования работы криптофермы и генерирования [биткойнов](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Биткойнов\"), которые затем тратились в странах Восточной [Европы](/index.php/%D0%95%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0 \"Европа\"). После ареста участников группировки сотрудники правоохранительных органов обнаружили в доме у их лидера 15 тыс. биткойнов стоимостью $109 млн и ювелирные украшения на общую сумму в $557 тыс., а также два спортивных автомобиля. Криптовалютой для отмывания похищенных средств также пользуется киберпреступная группировка Lazarus, предположительно работающая на северокорейское правительство. Согласно отчету SWIFT, киберпреступники похищают деньги у банков, конвертируют в криптовалюту через множество бирж с целью скрыть их происхождение, а затем снова переводят в реальные деньги и отправляют на счета в [КНДР](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%9D%D0%94%D0%A0 \"КНДР\"). В редких случаях злоумышленники покупают на похищенные у банков средства предоплаченные криптовалютные карты – физические дебетовые карты, на которых вместо реальных денег можно держать криптовалюту. Снимать средства с таких карт можно через специальные банкоматы, кроме того, их можно использовать для оплаты товаров и услуг. Однако, как подчеркивают эксперты, представленные выше примеры – это, скорее, исключение, чем правило. Такие случаи встречаются очень редко по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денег. Тем не менее, по мнению специалистов, в будущем число подобных случаев будет расти. #### Американские адвокаты будут расследовать масштабные случаи отмывания денег в Эстонии [Эстония](/index.php/%D0%AD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Эстония\") заключила договор с действующим в США адвокатским бюро Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP об оказании правовых услуг эстонскому государству по вопросам, связанным с фактами международного отмывания денег[[12]](#cite_note-11).

В 2018-2019 годах [американский](/index.php/%D0%A1%D0%A8%D0%90 \"США\") финансист, владелец Hermitage Capital Билл Браудер подал заявления об отмывании денег через эстонские отделения датского банка Danske Вank и шведского банка Swedbank. Через эстонский филиал датского банка Danske Bank в 2007-2015 годы прошел 201 млрд евро подозрительного происхождения. \"Серые\" сделки связаны с бизнесом клиентов-нерезидентов, прекративших на тот момент свою деятельность. По делу были задержаны 10 бывших сотрудников [Danske Bank](/index.php/Danske_Bank \"Danske Bank\"). Задержанные были, главным образом, менеджерами по работе с клиентами, все они обвиняются в отмывании денег, общая сумма сомнительных транзакций составила около 300 млн евро. По делу были задержаны 10 бывших сотрудников Danske Bank. Задержанные были, главным образом, менеджерами по работе с клиентами, все они обвиняются в отмывании денег, общая сумма сомнительных транзакций составила около 300 млн евро. По словам Браудера, эстонские банковские сотрудники под руководством главы отделения датского банка Айваром Рехе (Aivar Rehe) создали условия для масштабного отмывания денег и скрывали это. 23 сентября 2019 года Рехе покончил с собой. Полиция и прокуратура не сообщили о причинах суицида. По данным издания [The Wall Street Journal](/index.php/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\"), [Центробанк России](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Центробанк России\") еще в 2013 году предупреждал эстонское отделение банка о возможных незаконных перечислениях денег российскими клиентами, но Danske Bank необходимых мер не принял.

Juli 2024 - 22 Minuten Lesezeit **[Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/wie-funktioniert-geldwaesche/)** – ein Begriff, der längst nicht nur in Kriminalromanen auftaucht, sondern reale und tiefgreifende Konsequenzen für Wirtschaftssysteme weltweit darstellt. Insbesondere **Deutschland** hat sich, vielleicht unerwartet für viele, zu einem wahren Hotspot bzw. **Geldwäscheparadies** entwickelt. In diesem Artikel widmen wir uns den zentralen Fragen: **Warum** ist Deutschland zu einem Eldorado für Geldwäsche avanciert? **Wie** schneidet die Bundesrepublik im europäischen Vergleich ab, und **welche** **Folgen** hat das Geldwäscheparadies Deutschland für die Wirtschaft und den Finanzsektor? Die Antworten auf diese Fragen sind vielschichtig und führen uns in die Tiefen des internationalen Finanzwesens, zu Schwachstellen in nationalen Rechtssystemen und den politischen wie ökonomischen Dynamiken, die Deutschland in dieser Rolle festigen. Wir betrachten die **Hintergründe**, die strukturellen Probleme und die Verstrickungen, die Deutschland zur Zieladresse für schmutziges Geld machen. Zudem stellen wir die **Strategien und Maßnahmen** vor, die auf nationaler und europäischer Ebene ergriffen werden, um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzuwirken und zeigen auf, **welche Schritte** noch notwendig sind, um effektive Kontrollmechanismen zu etablieren. Inhalt [Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788086) [Europäischer Vergleich](#t-1722253788087) [Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788088) [Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788089) ## Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### Gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen Deutschland verfügt über **umfangreiche gesetzliche Bestimmungen** zur Bekämpfung der [Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/phasen-der-geldwaesche/), darunter das [Geldwäschegesetz (GwG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/), die [6 Geldwäscherichtlinien](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) sowie [§ 261 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__261.html). Trotz dieser Regulatorien gibt es Schwächen in der Umsetzung. Die Verfolgung von Geldwäschefällen hängt stark von der **Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Behörden** wie Polizei, Finanzbehörden und der Justiz ab. Eine häufige Kritik ist, dass es zu lange dauert, bis verdächtige Aktivitäten untersucht und rechtlich verfolgt werden. Zudem fehlen oft klare Vorgaben für die präventive Eindämmung illegaler Vermögensumwandlung in bestimmten Branchen, wie z.B. im Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel. ### Finanzaufsicht und Kontrolle Die [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/pflicht-zur-bestellung-eines-geldwaeschebeauftragten/) in Deutschland steht zunehmend in der Kritik, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die **Zuständigkeiten und die Effizienz der Aufsichtsbehörden**. Während die **Bundesanstalt für Finanz-dienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin)**für den Finanzsektor zuständig ist, liegen die Aufsichtspflichten für andere Bereiche wie z.B. Autohäuser, Immobilienmakler, Juweliere etc. bei den lokalen Aufsichtsbehörden. Dieses System führt zu einem **\"Flickenteppich\"** an undurchsichtigen Zuständigkeiten, was die Wirksamkeit der Geldwäschebekämpfung erheblich beeinträchtigt. Zusätzlich sorgt die **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)**, die zentrale Meldestelle für Verdachtsmeldungen, für massive Kritik. Der FIU wird Fach- und Knowhow-Mangel sowie ein erheblicher Personalmangel vorgeworfen. Dies führt dazu, dass viele Verdachtsmeldungen nicht zeitnah bearbeitet werden können. Die ineffiziente Struktur und mangelnde Ressourcen der FIU schwächen die Geldwäscheprävention und lassen Kriminellen zu viel Spielraum. ### Banken und Finanzdienstleister **Banken und andere Finanzinstitute** sind **Schlüsselakteure** im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Sie sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, Verdachtsmeldungen über fragwürdige Transaktionen abzugeben und interne Kontrollen zur Prävention von Finanzwäsche durchzuführen. Dennoch gibt es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Banken ihrer **Sorgfaltspflicht** nicht nachkommen. Ursachen hierfür sind oft unzureichende interne Kontrollen, mangelnde Schulung des Personals oder bewusstes Ignorieren von Vorschriften. Große Banken sind häufig in Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, was zeigt, dass trotz bestehender Regelungen die praktische Umsetzung mangelhaft ist. ### Hohe Bargeldnutzung Deutschland hat traditionell eine **hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen**. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. Dies führt zu mehreren spezifischen Schwächen: #### **Anonymität der Transaktionen** * Bargeldtransaktionen sind anonym und hinterlassen keine digitalen Spuren, was es den Strafverfolgungsbehörden erschwert, die Herkunft und den Fluss der Gelder nachzuverfolgen. Dies macht Bargeld zu einem bevorzugten Mittel für Kriminelle, die illegale Gelder waschen möchten. #### ****Mangelnde Transparenz**** * Große Bargeldtransaktionen sind weniger transparent als elektronische Transaktionen. Selbst wenn solche Transaktionen gemeldet werden müssen, ist es schwieriger, verdächtige Muster zu erkennen und zu analysieren. Dies führt zu Lücken in der Prüfung und Erkennung von Geldwäscheaktivitäten. #### ******Erschwerte Durchsetzung von Gesetzen****** * Die hohen Bargeldnutzungsraten erschweren die Durchsetzung von Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetzen. Während Banken und andere Finanzinstitute strengen Regulierungen und Meldepflichten unterliegen, sind Bargeldtransaktionen oft weniger reguliert, insbesondere wenn sie außerhalb formaler Finanzinstitute stattfinden. ### Kritische Sektoren: ### ### Immobilien, Kunst- und Auktionshäuser, Autohäuser Bestimmte [Sektoren](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/warnung-vor-neuer-betrugsmasche-fuer-gwg-relevante-haendler/) sind besonders anfällig für Geldwäsche, darunter der **Immobiliensektor, Kunst-** und **Auktionshäuser** sowie **Autohäuser**. Diese Sektoren bieten aufgrund hoher Transaktionssummen und oftmals unzureichender Überwachung ideale Bedingungen für die Umwandlung illegaler Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte. #### **Immobiliensektor** Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt ist besonders anfällig für \"schmutziges\" Geld. **Große Bargeldtransaktionen** und **komplexe Eigentumsstrukturen** machen es schwierig, die Herkunft von Geldern nachzuverfolgen. In Städten wie Berlin, Hamburg und München wird der Immobilienmarkt oft genutzt, um Schwarzgeld zu waschen. Der Erwerb von Luxusimmobilien oder die Investition in Bauprojekte sind gängige Methoden, um illegale Gelder in den legalen Wirtschaftskreislauf einzuschleusen. Seit dem **1. April 2023** gibt es zwar in Deutschland ein **Bargeldverbot beim Immobilienkauf (**[**§ 59 Abs. 11 GwG**](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/__59.html)**)**, um die Finanzwäsche einzudämmen, dennoch bleibt die Umsetzung und Überwachung dieser Regelungen eine Herausforderung. #### **Kunst- und Auktionshäuser** Der Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel ist ein weiterer Sektor, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Hier **fehlen oft klare Vorgaben und Meldepflichten**, die eine wirksame Überwachung und Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen ermöglichen würden. Es gibt **keine** flächendeckende, verpflichtende **Registrierung** **und Lizenzierung** von Kunst- und Antiquitätenhändlern, was die systematische Überwachung erschwert. Für **Transaktionen über 10.000 Euro** bestehen jedoch **Meldepflichten**, die häufig nicht konsequent umgesetzt werden. Kunsthändler und Auktionshäuser sind verpflichtet, bei hochpreisigen Transaktionen die Herkunft der Gelder und die Identität der Käufer umfassend zu überprüfen und zu dokumentieren. #### **Autohäuser** Autohäuser sind ebenfalls ein kritischer Sektor, da hier **hohe Summen in bar** bezahlt werden können, um illegale Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte umzuwandeln. In Deutschland gilt eine **Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro für Fahrzeugkäufe**. Transaktionen, die diesen Betrag überschreiten, müssen dokumentiert und die am Kauf Beteiligten müssen identifiziert werden. Trotz dieser Regelungen gibt es oft Lücken in der Überwachung und Durchsetzung, was die Kontrolle und Dokumentation solcher Transaktionen erschwert. ### Unternehmen und Steueroasen Viele Unternehmen nutzen **komplexe Firmenstrukturen**, darunter auch Briefkastenfirmen bzw. allgemein Offshore-Konstrukte, um Geldwäsche zu betreiben. **Offshore-Konstrukte** sind rechtliche und finanzielle Strukturen, die in Ländern oder Gebieten mit günstigen Steuer- und Regulierungsgesetzen (z.B. Bulgarien, Luxemburg, Schweiz, Malta...) eingerichtet werden. Diese Gebiete werden oft als Steueroasen bezeichnet. Solche Konstrukte beinhalten häufig die **Gründung von****Briefkastenfirmen oder Tochtergesellschaften**, die hauptsächlich dazu dienen, steuerliche Vorteile zu nutzen und die Herkunft von Geldern zu verschleiern. Diese Strukturen erschweren die Nachverfolgung illegaler Gelder erheblich. Deutschland hat zwar Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Nutzung solcher Konstrukte zu bekämpfen, jedoch bleiben internationale Verflechtungen ein großes Hindernis. Steueroasen bieten weiterhin **Schlupflöcher für Unternehmen**, die illegale Gelder verstecken oder waschen möchten. Die Transparenz und Offenlegung von Unternehmensstrukturen ist daher ein zentraler Punkt im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Um Geldwäsche in Deutschland effektiv zu bekämpfen, müssen die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen kontinuierlich verbessert werden. Eine stärkere internationale Zusammenarbeit und gezielte Maßnahmen zur Überwachung der kritischen Branchen und der Finanzinstitute sind unerlässlich. Nur durch eine umfassende und koordinierte Strategie kann die Geldwäsche nachhaltig eingedämmt werden. **Schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen vor **Geldwäsche-Risiken**!** Fordern Sie noch heute Ihre kostenlose Erstberatung an und profitieren Sie von unserer langjährigen Expertise im Bereich der Geldwäscheprävention. [Jetzt Beratungsgespräch sichern](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/anfrage/) ## Europäischer Vergleich Die **Gesetzgebung** zur Bannung der Geldwäsche **variiert in Europa erheblich**. Während einige Länder strenge Regulierungen und effektive Durchsetzungsmechanismen implementiert haben, stehen andere noch vor massiven Herausforderungen. In diesem Abschnitt vergleichen wir die Ansätze mehrerer europäischer Länder und analysieren, wie **Deutschland im Vergleich** abschneidet. ### **Länder mit besonders zielführenden Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche** **Die Niederlande** gelten als Vorreiter in der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Sie haben ein zentrales Meldesystem für verdächtige Transaktionen, das von der Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-NL) verwaltet wird. Dieses System ermöglicht eine schnelle Erkennung und Verfolgung dubioser Aktivitäten. Die enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden trägt maßgeblich zum Erfolg bei. * Zentrales Meldesystem, enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden * Trotz strenger Regulierungen Probleme bei der Abwehr grenzüberschreitender Geldwäsche **Frankreich** hat ebenfalls umfangreiche Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung der Geldwäsche eingeführt. Die französische Finanzaufsichtsbehörde, Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), und Tracfin, eine spezielle Einheit zum Kampf gegen Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung, überwachen und regulieren Finanztransaktionen streng. Frankreich ist bekannt für seine konsequente Strafverfolgung und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von EU-Richtlinien zur Geldwäschereduzierung. * Strenge Kontrolle und konsequente Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinien * Komplikationen bei der Beaufsichtigung von [Kryptowährungen](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/kryptowaehrungen-und-geldwaeschepraevention/) und neuen Finanztechnologien **Das Vereinigte Königreich** hat einige der strengsten Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetze in Europa. Die National Crime Agency (NCA) und die Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) spielen eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Überwachung und Durchsetzung. Großbritannien hat strenge Meldepflichten und umfassende Maßnahmen zur Überprüfung und Verifizierung von Kundenidentitäten eingeführt. * Strenge Gesetze und rigorose Nachverfolgung durch NCA und FCA * London als globales Finanzzentrum bleibt Hotspot für Geldwäscheaktivitäten ### **Länder mit großen Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung** **Deutschland** hat, wie bereits oben erwähnt, in den letzten Jahren seine Gesetze zur Abwehr der Geldwäsche verschärft. Trotz dieser Fortschritte wird Deutschland oft kritisiert. Die FIU wird bzgl. Fach-, Knowhow- und Personalmangel bemängelt. Ebenso die Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) steht aufgrund begrenzter Ressourcen und komplexer Finanzströme vor einigen Hürden. Insbesondere in den bereits genannten Sektoren und bei der Beobachtung von Nichtfinanzunternehmen (\"Flickenteppich\") herrscht Ineffizienz der Behörden. Zudem hat Deutschland traditionell eine hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. * Umfassende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen * Ineffizienz der Behörden, Personalmangel, allg. hohe Bargeldnutzung Obwohl die **Schweiz** kein EU-Mitglied ist, spielt sie eine bedeutende Rolle im europäischen Finanzsystem. Die Schweiz hat in den letzten Jahren ihre Gesetze zum Widerstand gegen Geldwäsche verschärft und arbeitet eng mit internationalen Organisationen zusammen. Die Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA) überwacht Finanzinstitute und sorgt für die Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften. Die Schweiz bleibt jedoch aufgrund ihrer Bankgeheimnisse, attraktiven Steuerregelungen und ihrer sogenannten Zollfreigrenzen ein Hotspot für illegale Geldströme. * Enge Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen Organisationen und verschärfte Gesetze * Bankgeheimnis, attraktive Steuerregelungen und Zollfreigrenzen fördern Geldwäsche **Italien** hat mit erheblichen Hindernissen im Bereich der Geldwäsche zu kämpfen, insbesondere durch die Präsenz der Mafia und anderer krimineller Organisationen. Die italienische Regierung hat eine Vielzahl von Gesetzen und Regulierungen eingeführt, um Geldwäsche zu bekämpfen, darunter die Einrichtung der Anti-Mafia-Direktion (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, DIA). Trotz dieser Maßnahmen bleibt die konsequente Umsetzung ein ständiges Problem. * Einrichtung spezialisierter Anti-Mafia-Einheiten * Starke Präsenz der Mafia und ineffektive Umsetzung von Gesetzen ### **Fazit des Vergleichs** Ein Vergleich der europäischen Länder zeigt, dass **jedes Land gewisse Stärke und Schwächen** bei der Geldwäschebeseitigung aufweist, aber Staaten wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich und das Vereinigte Königreich** insgesamt **sehr erfolgreiche Maßnahmen** zur Geldwäscheneutralisierung implementiert haben. Diese Länder setzen auf enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Behörden und Finanzinstituten, strenge Regulierungen und beharrliche Strafverfolgung.Länder wie die **Schweiz und Italien** hingegen stehen hier vor **enormeren Stolpersteinen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter verbessern, um Geldwäsche entgegenzuwirken. **Deutschland** zeigt durch die stetige Verschärfung der gesetzlichen Regularien zwar einen **guten Ansatz**, muss jedoch ebenso seine Maßnahmen optimieren, insbesondere im Bereich der personellen Ausstattung und der Inspektion der kritischen Sektoren. ## Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche hat **erhebliche wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen für Deutschland**. Durch das Einfließen von illegalem Geld in die Wirtschaft werden Marktmechanismen verzerrt. Investitionen in Immobilien, Kunst und Luxusgüter mit illegalen Geldern können die Preise in diesen Märkten künstlich in die Höhe treiben. Dies kann zu einer Blase führen, die bei ihrem Platzen erhebliche **wirtschaftliche Schäden** verursachen kann. Außerdem **entgehen dem Staat** durch Geldwäsche **erhebliche Steuereinnahmen**, die sonst für öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Infrastrukturprojekte verwendet werden könnten. ### **Soziale und politische Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche **untergräbt das Vertrauen der Bürger in staatliche Institutionen und den Finanzsektor**. Wenn illegale Aktivitäten ungestraft bleiben, entsteht der Eindruck, dass Kriminalität nicht effektiv bekämpft wird und dass Gesetze nicht für alle gleichermaßen gelten. Dies kann zu sozialem Unmut und einem Rückgang der gesellschaftlichen Moral führen. Politisch kann dies Druck auf die Regierung ausüben, strengere Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, was wiederum die **politische Stabilität** beeinflussen kann. ### **Rechtliche Folgen** Die **rechtlichen Konsequenzen** illegaler Geldtransaktionen sind **weitreichend**. Individuen und Unternehmen, die der Geldwäsche überführt werden, sehen sich erheblichen Strafen gegenüber, einschließlich **hoher Geldstrafen** und **langjährigen Gefängnisstrafen**. Darüber hinaus können Unternehmen ihre **Geschäftslizenzen verlieren**, was ihre Fähigkeit, international zu operieren, stark einschränkt. Prominente Fälle zeigen, dass die Justiz zunehmend härter gegen Geldwäscher vorgeht. ### **Internationale Reputation** Geldwäsche hat auch starke **Auswirkungen auf die** **internationale Reputation Deutschlands**. Wenn ein Land als „Geldwäscheparadies“ angesehen wird, kann dies das **Vertrauen** **internationaler Investoren und Geschäftspartner****beeinträchtigen**. Internationale Organisationen wie die Financial Action Task Force (FATF) bewerten die Effektivität der Geldwäschebannung in verschiedenen Ländern. Negative Bewertungen können dazu führen, dass Deutschland **unter erhöhter Beobachtung** steht und möglicherweise **internationalen Druck** zur Verschärfung seiner Gesetze und Maßnahmen erfährt. Die Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind somit vielschichtig und betreffen verschiedene Bereiche der Gesellschaft. Wirtschaftliche Verzerrungen, sozialer und politischer Vertrauensverlust, rechtliche Strafen und die Beeinträchtigung der internationalen Reputation sind nur einige der gravierenden Auswirkungen. Um diesen negativen Folgen entgegenzuwirken, ist eine verstärkte und koordinierte Anstrengung zur Vorbeugung von Geldwäsche notwendig. ## Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Gesetzliche Reformen** Eine der wichtigsten Maßnahmen zur Entgegenwirkung der Geldwäsche ist die **kontinuierliche Verbesserung** der gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Deutschland hat diese bereits durch das GwG, die [GwG-Richtlinien](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/vierte-eu-geldwaescherichtlinie/) und den **§ 261 des StGBs verschärft**, aber es gibt weiterhin Raum für Verbesserungen. Regelmäßige **Überprüfungen und Anpassungen der Gesetze** sind notwendig, um auf neue Geldwäschemethoden zu reagieren. Zudem sollten härtere Strafen für Verstöße und eine bessere Ausstattung der Strafverfolgungsbehörden implementiert werden. #### **Ergänzung: EU-Gesetzespaket** Nach intensiven Verhandlungen und Abstimmungen wurde das [**AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**](https://www.hilfssheriff.de/eu-gesetzespaket-die-umsetzungsfrist-laeuft/) nun offiziell im Amtsblatt veröffentlicht. Dieses umfassende Regelwerk besteht aus drei wesentlichen und detaillierten Rechtsakten: **Die AMLA-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1620)** Die[**AMLA-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401620) etabliert die **neue EU-Behörde für die Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AMLA)**. Diese Behörde wird in Frankfurt am Main ansässig sein und **ab Mitte 2024** ihre Tätigkeit aufnehmen. Ihre Hauptaufgaben umfassen die direkte und indirekte Aufsicht über Verpflichtete im Finanzsektor, die einem hohen Risiko der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung ausgesetzt sind. **Die Geldwäsche-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1624)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401624) zielt darauf ab, die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für **Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung** zu verhindern. Sie tritt am **10. Juli 2027** in Kraft, mit spezifischen Ausnahmen für **Fußballagenten und Profifußballvereine**, die bis zum **10. Juli 2029** Zeit haben, die notwendigen Anpassungen vorzunehmen. **Einführung einer EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** Ein weiter wichtiger Bestandteil der **Geldwäsche-Verordnung** ist die **Einführung** einer **EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** in Höhe von **10.000 Euro**. Diese Regelung gilt für Barzahlungen zwischen Unternehmen sowie zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern, **nicht jedoch für Transaktionen zwischen Privatpersonen**. EU-Mitgliedstaaten haben die Option, eine niedrigere Obergrenze festzulegen. Die Regelung tritt voraussichtlich **Mitte 2026** in Kraft und stellt besonders für Länder wie Deutschland, die bisher keine Bargeldobergrenze hatten, eine bedeutende Änderung dar. In Deutschland existiert bisher keine generelle Obergrenze für Bargeldzahlungen. Allerdings muss sich der Käufer bei Bargeldzahlungen über 10.000 Euro ausweisen und die Herkunft des Geldes nachweisen. Der Händler ist verpflichtet, diese Informationen zu dokumentieren und aufzubewahren. **Die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie (Richtlinie (EU) 2024/1640)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Richtlinie**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401640) legt die **Mechanismen** fest, die von den Mitgliedstaaten zur Verhinderung der Nutzung des Finanzsystems für Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umgesetzt werden müssen. Sie **gilt nicht unmittelbar in den Mitgliedstaaten**, sondern muss in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden. Die Frist für die meisten Vorgaben ist der **10. Juli 2027**. Diese neuen Regelungen, einschließlich der Bargeldobergrenze, stellen einen bedeutenden Schritt in den Bemühungen der EU dar, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung effektiv zu bekämpfen und die Integrität des Finanzsystems zu gewährleisten. ### **Stärkung der Finanzaufsicht** Die **BaFin, FIU** bzw. allgemein die **deutschen Aufsichtsbehörden** spielen eine **zentrale Rolle** bei der **Beseitigung der Geldwäsche**. Um ihre Effektivität zu steigern, müssen die **personellen und technischen Ressourcen** sowie das **Fachwissen** erweitert werden. Dies umfasst z.B. die Einstellung zusätzlicher Experten und die Einführung moderner Analysetools zum Monitoring verdächtiger Transaktionen. Eine bessere internationale Zusammenarbeit und der Austausch von Informationen mit anderen Behörden können ebenfalls die Effizienz bei der Geldwäscheeindämmung erhöhen. ### **Technologische Lösungen** Zwar bringt der Einsatz von **Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI)** natürlich einerseits neue große Herausforderungen (z.B. gefälschte Ausweisdokumente, Deepfakes) mit sich, andererseits kann der **Einsatz moderner Technologie** die Geldwäscheeindämmung hingegen fördern. KI und maschinelles Lernen bieten **neue Möglichkeiten** zur **Erkennung und Analyse von Mustern**, die auf illegale Finanzströme hinweisen. Diese Technologien können große Datenmengen in Echtzeit überwachen und verdächtige Aktivitäten schneller und präziser identifizieren als herkömmliche Methoden. Darüber hinaus können **Blockchain-Technologien** zur Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen und zur Erhöhung der Transparenz im Finanzsektor beitragen. ### **Internationale Kooperation** Geldwäsche ist ein globales Problem, das eine internationale Zusammenarbeit erfordert. **Gemeinsame Initiativen** und der **Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices** sind entscheidend, um grenzüberschreitende Geldwäsche zielführend zu bekämpfen. Die Teilnahme an internationalen Taskforces und die Unterstützung globaler Standards zur [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaeschebeauftragter-aufgaben-rechte-pflichten-risiken/) sind von größter Wichtigkeit. Das bereits beschlossene **EU GwG-Paket**sowie die Schaffung einer **EU einheitlichen****zentralen Anti-Geldwäsche Behörde**stellt hier einen wichtigen Schritt bei der Entgegenwirkung illegaler Finanzabwicklungen dar. ### **Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Sensibilisierung** Ein oft vernachlässigter Aspekt der Geldwäscheabwehr ist die **Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit** und die Förderung eines besseren Verständnisses für die Risiken und Folgen von Geldwäsche. Durch gezielte **Aufklärungskampagnen** sowie [**(Mitarbeiter-)Schulungen**](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaesche-schulung-mitarbeiter/) können Bürger und Unternehmen über die Anzeichen und Meldemöglichkeiten von Geldwäsche informiert werden. Dies erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass verdächtige Aktivitäten erkannt und gemeldet werden. Diese Maßnahmen sind **zentrale Bausteine** einer erfolgreichen Strategie. Nur durch die Kombination dieser Ansätze kann Deutschland den Kraftakt der Geldwäschereduzierung meistern und seine Wirtschaft, Unternehmen sowie seine Verbraucher schützen. **Geldwäscheprävention** leicht gemacht: **Online-Schulung** für Ihr Team Unsere Online-Geldwäschepräventionsschulung bietet Mitarbeitern die Kenntnisse, die sie benötigen, um Geldwäsche zu erkennen und zu verhindern, gemäß den gesetzlichen Anforderungen.

[Jetzt Team anmelden](https://exkulpa.de/akademie/gwg-schulung-fuer-mitarbeiter/) ## Fallbeispiele Im Folgenden noch einige**Skandalbeispielfälle** von Geldwäsche, in die unter anderem **europäische Länder** verwickelt waren: ### **Fallbeispiel: Deutsche Bank** Die **Deutsche Bank** ist mehrfach wegen ihrer Verwicklung in Geldwäscheskandale in die Schlagzeilen geraten. Ein prominenter Fall ist die **Beteiligung** an einem riesigen Geldwäsche-Schema, das als **\"Russischer Spiegelhandel\"** bekannt ist. Zwischen 2011 und 2015 wurden über die Moskauer, Londoner und New Yorker Niederlassungen der Deutschen Bank etwa **10 Milliarden Dollar** gewaschen. Die Bank musste wegen unzureichender Kontrollmechanismen **Strafen** in Höhe von **630 Millionen Dollar** an die US- und britischen Behörden zahlen. ### **Fallbeispiel: Danske Bank** Die **Danske Bank** war in einen der **größten Geldwäscheskandale Europas** verwickelt. Über die estnische Niederlassung der Bank wurden zwischen 2007 und 2015 rund **200 Milliarden Euro** verdächtiger Gelder, hauptsächlich aus Russland, Aserbaidschan und der Ukraine, gewaschen. Der Skandal führte zu einem massiven Verlust an Vertrauen und einer erheblichen Belastung des Rufs der Bank. Die dänischen und estnischen Behörden sowie internationale Regulierungsbehörden führten umfassende Untersuchungen durch, was zu **hohen Geldstrafen und einem Rücktritt des CEO** führte. ### **Fallbeispiel: 1MDB-Skandal** Der **1MDB-Skandal** ist ein **globales Beispiel** für weitreichende Geldwäsche und Korruption. Der malaysische Staatsfonds 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) war in einen massiven Geldwäscheskandal verwickelt, bei dem **Milliarden von Dollar** durch ein komplexes Netzwerk von **Offshore-Konten und Scheinfirmen** gewaschen wurden. Banken in der Schweiz, Singapur und den USA waren beteiligt. In Deutschland spielte die Deutsche Bank erneut eine Rolle, indem sie Transaktionen im Zusammenhang mit 1MDB abgewickelt hat. Der Skandal führte zu **weltweiten Ermittlungen und zahlreichen Verhaftungen**. ### **Fallbeispiel: Wirecard** Der **Wirecard-Skandal** ist ein jüngeres Beispiel für umfassende Finanzkriminalität und Geldwäsche in Deutschland. Das Unternehmen Wirecard, ein Zahlungsdienstleister, war in betrügerische Aktivitäten verwickelt, bei denen angebliche Vermögenswerte in Höhe von **1,9 Milliarden Euro** fehlten. Die Geldwäscheaspekte des Skandals betreffen die komplexen internationalen Transaktionen und das Verschwinden großer Geldsummen durch **Briefkastenfirmen** in verschiedenen Ländern. Der Skandal führte zu einer **umfangreichen Untersuchung** durch deutsche und internationale Behörden und dem **Zusammenbruch des Unternehmens**. ### **Fallbeispiel: HSBC** Die **britische Bank HSBC** war in mehrere Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, darunter die Bereitstellung von Finanzdienstleistungen für Drogenkartelle in Mexiko und Kolumbien. Zwischen 2006 und 2010 wusch HSBC schätzungsweise **881 Millionen Dollar** an Drogengeldern. Die Bank gestand Versäumnisse bei der Geldwäscheprävention ein und zahlte **1,9 Milliarden Dollar an Strafen** im Rahmen eines Vergleichs mit den US-Behörden. Dieser Fall zeigte die globalen Dimensionen von Geldwäsche und die Notwendigkeit strengerer Kontrollen bei internationalen Banken. Diese Fallstudien verdeutlichen die **vielfältigen Methoden** und **enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche in Europa und weltweit**. Sie zeigen, wie leicht Finanzinstitute in illegale Aktivitäten verstrickt werden können und welche gravierenden Folgen dies für die beteiligten Unternehmen und die globale Wirtschaft hat. Durch die Untersuchung dieser Fälle können wichtige Lehren für die Verbesserung der Geldwäscheprävention und -bekämpfung gezogen werden. ## Fazit **Geldwäsche** bleibt ein **erhebliches Problem** in Deutschland und weltweit. Trotz bestehender Gesetze und Regulierungen gibt es zahlreiche Schwächen und Hürden bei der Gegenwehr. Die **Ursachen** für Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind vielfältig, darunter **gesetzliche Lücken**, **unzureichende Aufsicht**, die **Rolle von Banken und Finanzdienstleistern**, die **kritischen Sektoren** und die Nutzung **komplexer Firmenstrukturen** sowie **Steueroasen**. Ein **europäischer Vergleich** zeigt, dass Länder wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich** und **das** **Vereinigte Königreich** besonders **fruchtbare Maßnahmen** zur Eindämmung der Geldwäsche eingeführt haben. Im Gegensatz dazu stehen **Deutschland, die Schweiz** und **Italien**vor **umfangreicheren Komplikationen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter optimieren. Die **Konsequenzen** der Geldwäsche sind weitreichend, einschließlich **wirtschaftlicher Verzerrungen**, **sozialem** und **politischem Vertrauensverlust**, **rechtlichen Strafen** und **Beeinträchtigungen** der internationalen **Reputation**. Fallbeispiele wie die Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, 1MDB, Wirecard und HSBC illustrieren die vielfältigen Methoden und enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche. Die **Abwehr** der Geldwäsche erfordert **kontinuierliche Anpassungen und Verbesserungen**. Neue Technologien und komplexere Finanzströme stellen laufend neue Schwierigkeiten dar. Deutschland muss weiterhin seine gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen verbessern, um mit den sich wandelnden Methoden der Geldwäsche Schritt zu halten. Ein wichtiger Schritt in diese Richtung ist das kürzlich verabschiedete **AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**, das unter anderem eine **EU-weite Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro** einführt. Diese Maßnahme zielt darauf ab, die Transparenz bei größeren Finanztransaktionen zu erhöhen und die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für illegale Aktivitäten zu erschweren. Ein verstärkter Fokus auf die internationale Zusammenarbeit ist unerlässlich. Nur durch gemeinsame Anstrengungen und den Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices kann Geldwäsche konsequent entgegengewirkt werden. Die Integration **moderner Technologien** wie Künstlicher Intelligenz und **Blockchain** kann ebenfalls dazu beitragen, die Erkennung und Verfolgung von illegalen Finanzströmen zu verbessern.

Это одно из самых масштабных преступлений, с которыми мировая экономика имеет дело столетиями. Finance.ua расскажет о самых резонансных случаях и схемах отмывания денег в мире за последние годы. Оглавление 1. [Что такое отмывание денег](#headline_1) 2. [«Панамские документы»](#headline_4) 3. [«Райские документы»](#headline_8) 4. [Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank](#headline_10) 5. [Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом](#headline_13) 6. [Liberty Reserve](#headline_15) Finance UA Обновлено 11 июля 2024 Отмывание денег имеет серьезные далеко идущие негативные последствия для экономики, общества и целостности финансовой системы. Это уже давно глобальная проблема, которая угрожает финансовым системам и способствует росту преступной деятельности. По данным МВФ, уровень отмывания денег составляет 2−5% мирового ВВП. В причастности к таким действиям в последние годы были уличены известные банки, политики, знаменитости и компании. ## Что такое отмывание денег Прежде всего, разберемся подробнее, что означает отмывание денег. Это преступление, связанное с сокрытием или попыткой скрыть незаконное происхождение полученных средств. В рамках этого процесса человек или учреждение превращает незаконные средства в законные через сложные каналы. Деньги проходят различные этапы, включая конвертацию и перевод в официально признанное учреждение. Например, человек получил деньги путем преступной деятельности (мошенничество, торговля наркотиками, контрабанда оружия, терроризм и т. п.), а затем вливает эти средства на официальный рынок. Как это он делает? Покупает недвижимость, транспортные средства, компании и т. д., таким образом превращая их происхождение в законное. Тот, кто отмывает деньги, обходит финансовую систему страны и манипулирует ею, чтобы вводить и тратить неправомерно полученные деньги. Рассмотрим 5 громких историй с отмыванием денег, которые стали известны в последние годы и получили международный резонанс. ## «Панамские документы» Утечка «Панамских документов» (Panama Papers) в 2016 году стала монументальным разоблачением, которое обнародовало многочисленные резонансные случаи отмывания денег, уклонение от уплаты налогов и обход международных санкций. Утечка информации касалась банков, юридических фирм и чиновников во всем мире, раскрывая масштабы незаконной финансовой деятельности, скрытой через оффшорные банки и подставные компании. «Панамские документы» — это история с утечкой зашифрованных конфиденциальных документов, которые были собственностью панамской юридической фирмы Mossack Fonseca, специализирующейся на работе с оффшорами. Эти документы в апреле 2016 года опубликовала немецкая газета Süddeutsche Zeitung, назвав их «панамскими документами». Таким образом удалось разоблачить сеть из более 214 тыс. налоговых гаваней, в которые были привлечены люди и организации из 200 разных стран. В центре этих историй стоит Mossack Fonseca — панамский поставщик оффшорных компаний с десятками офисов по всему миру. Компания продает свои оболочки фирм в таких городах как Цюрих, Лондон и Гонконг. Mossack Fonseca является посредником для тех, кто хочет зарегистрировать компанию в «налоговом раю» и пользоваться льготами. Mossack Fonseca тесно сотрудничала с такими финансовыми гигантами как HSBC, Deutsche Bank и Credit Suisse, чтобы помочь их клиентам скрыть свои средства. Так, клиенты Mossack Fonseca могли приобрести анонимную компанию всего за 1 тыс. долларов. Но за эту цену можно получить просто пустую оболочку. За дополнительную плату Mossack Fonseca предоставляла фиктивного директора и при желании скрывала настоящего акционера компании. В результате возникает оффшорная компания, чья подлинная цель и структура собственности зашифрована извне. ### Кто из известных людей «засветился» в «Панамских документах»? **Бывший премьер-министр Исландии Сигмундюр Гюннлейгссон** Как выяснили журналисты, Гюннлейгссон прятал миллионы долларов инвестиций исландских банков в оффшорных компаниях. Согласно документам, Гюннлейгссон и его жена купили оффшорную компанию Wintris в 2007 году, однако не указали ее в декларации. В 2010 году исландский премьер продал 50% компании Wintris своей жене за 1 доллар. **Бывший премьер-министр Грузии Бидзина Иванишвили** Иванишвили скрыл от налоговой тот факт, что владеет компанией Lynden Management Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах, не зафиксировав ее ни в одной декларации. Через эту компанию Иванишвили и его партнеры контролировали около 20% акций американской фармацевтической компании Raptor Pharmaceuticals. **Бывший премьер-министр Иордании Али Абу Рагеб** Журналисты обнаружили, что за несколько месяцев до истечения своего срока в должности премьера Рагеб зарегистрировал оффшорную компанию Jaar Investment Ltd, открывшую счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. Кроме того, политик вместе с супругой стал директором Jay Investment Holdings Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. До декабря 2014 года Рагебу принадлежали три компании на Сейшельских островах, а его дети были привлечены как директора в нескольких других компаниях, в частности Desert Star Investment Capital Ltd, которая имела счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. **Бывший вице-президент Ирака Ияд Аллави** Согласно расследованию, в 1985 году Аллави зарегистрировал через Mossack Fonseca компанию I.M.F. Holdings Inc. В 2013 году общая стоимость ее активов составила 1,5 млрд долларов. Еще одна компания, которую Аллави не указал в своей декларации — Moonlight Estates Limited. **Отец бывшего премьер-министра Великобритании Дэвида Кэмерона** Покойный отец бывшего британского премьера Дэвида Кэмерон Иен Кэмерон помогал создать и развивать оффшорную компанию Blairmore Holdings Inc в 1982 году и был вовлечен в ее деятельность вплоть до своей смерти в 2010-м. В 1998 году Blairmore была оценена в 20 млн долларов. **Президент Азербайджана Ильхам Алиев** Алиев и его супруга в 2003 году купили компанию Rosamund International Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. Тогда Алиев был депутатом парламента, а позже вступил в должность президента. Следовательно, политик, указанный директором и совладельцем Rosamund International Ltd, нарушил закон, запрещающий президенту заниматься бизнесом. В 2008 году две дочери Алиева приобрели компании Arbor Investments, LaBelleza Holdings Limited и Harvard Management Limited. Директором этих трех фирм оказался предприниматель Хасан Гозал. Он вместе со своим братом Абдолбары владел десятью компаниями, входящими в холдинг Intersun, где Абдолбары был президентом, а Хассан — вице-президентом. Таким образом, холдинг Intersun получил несколько крупных контрактов от государственной нефтяной компании Азербайджана, где Алиев еще до главы государства был первым вице-президентом. **Король Саудовской Аравии Салман ибн Абдул-Азиз Аль Сауд** Согласно «Панамским архивам», через оффшорные компании король Саудовской Аравии владел яхтой и недвижимостью в Лондоне, которую оценили в 34 млн долларов. На имя монарха зарегистрирован ряд компаний, в том числе Safason Corporation SA SPF, Verse Development Corporation, InRow Corporation, Crassus Limited и Park Property Limited. **Футболист Лионель Месси** Согласно обнародованным данным, Месси и его отцу принадлежит оффшорная компания Mega Star Enterprises, зарегистрированная в Панаме. Впервые она была упомянута в архивах Mossack Fonseca еще 13 июня 2013 года. На следующий день испанская прокуратура выдвинула против обеих Месси обвинения в многомиллионных налоговых махинациях. **Ближайшее окружение российского диктатора владимира путина** В «Панамских архивах» были упомянуты четыре компании, связанные с россией — Sonnette Overseas, International Media Overseas, Sunbarn и Sandalwood Continental. Все они были зарегистрированы в оффшорах через Mossack Fonseca и связаны с окружением путина. Так, International Media Overseas и Sonnette Overseas принадлежали близкому другу диктатора россии виолончелисту Сергею Ролдугину. В расследовании также упоминаются оффшорные компании спикера диктатора рф Дмитрия пескова, министра экономического развития Алексея Улюкаева, сына российского олигарха и друга путина Игоря Ротенберга, и других российских политиков. Выведенная ими в оффшоры сумма на 2016 год могла достигать 2 млрд долларов. ## «Райские документы» В ноябре 2017 года журналисты Международного консорциума журналистских расследований (ICIJ) обнародовали данные тайных документов о налоговых лазейках и бизнес-контактах чиновников из 50 стран мира, в том числе и Украины. Эта утечка получила название «Райские документы» (Paradise Papers) и содержала данные госреестров полутора десятков экзотических островов, где регистрируют оффшорные компании. Речь идет о 13,4 млн финансовых документов с данными о том, как богатейшие люди и компании мира тайно вкладывают деньги в оффшорные зоны, чтобы «защититься» от налогов или сохранить секретность деловых соглашений. В материалах, охватывающих период с 1950-го по 2016 год, фигурируют имена более 120 мировых политиков. Среди самых громких имен в документах — покойная королева Великобритании Елизавета II, а также корпорации, такие как Nike, Apple и Facebook. Большая часть материала, а именно 6,8 млн документов, касается деятельности юридической фирмы Appleby, действовавшей в 10 различных юрисдикциях. Но в другой части речь идет об оффшорах корпораций, спортсменов и политиков во всем мире. **Королева Британии Елизавета II** По данным из «Райских документов», около 10 млн фунтов стерлингов из частного состояния королевы Елизаветы II были инвестированы в оффшоры. Деньги в фонды на Каймановых островах и Бермудах вкладывало Герцогство Ланкастерское, что обеспечивало королеву доходами и управляло инвестициями в пределах ее частной собственности в 500 млн фунтов стерлингов. **российский предприниматель Юрий Мильнер** «Райские документы» обнаружили «кремлевский след» в компаниях Facebook Inc. и Twitter Inc. По данным расследователей, один из важных инвесторов обеих компаний — фонд DST Global, принадлежащий российскому миллиардеру Юрию Мильнеру, был финансово связан с российскими госкомпаниями. Так, на деньги, полученные от ВТБ Банка, фонд Мильнера приобрел в 2011 году акции Twitter. Инвестиции же в Facebook фонда DST Global фактически профинансировала дочерняя компания «Газпрома» — «Газпром инвестхолдинг», которую возглавлял тогда бизнесмен Алишер Усманов. Мильнер и партнеры продали свои акции Facebook и Twitter в 2012 и 2013 годах. **Бывший министр торговли США Уилбур Росс** По данным документов, бывший американский министр через серию оффшоров имел долю в компании Navigator, тесно сотрудничавшей с газовой компанией Sibur. Совладельцем Sibur был муж дочери путина. **Apple** Благодаря некоторым особенностям законодательства в оффшорах Apple несколько лет не платила миллиарды налогов. В частности, до 2014 года компания использовала лазейку в налоговом законодательстве США и Ирландии, известную как double Irish. Это схема оптимизации налоговых обязательств посредством использования двух ирландских и одной нидерландской компаний. Она позволила Apple постоянно производить продажу за пределами Северной и Южной Америки — а это почти 55% дохода — через ирландские дочерние компании, которые фактически были оффшорами. Таким образом, компания не платила никаких налогов. **Nike** Компания снижала налоговые ставки через свой филиал в Нидерландах. Схема работала таким образом: когда человек покупал товар, например, в Лондоне, то деньги за него уходили в главную британскую дочернюю компанию Nike. Затем денежные средства поступали в Нидерланды, где расположена штаб-квартира компании. В течение 2005−2014 годов компания могла перечислять деньги оттуда на Бермуды, где зарегистрирована ее «дочка» — Nike International Ltd. ## Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank Крупнейший банк Дании Danske Bank был замешан в масштабном скандале с отмыванием денег, связанном с подозрительными транзакциями примерно на 200 млрд евро через эстонский филиал. Скандал возник в 2018 году после раскрытия изоблачителем в эстонском отделении Danske, который сообщил, что банк проигнорировал признаки, указывающие на «потенциально преступные операции» по перемещению миллиардов долларов на Запад с 2008 по 2017 годы, в том числе от российских клиентов. Многие клиенты банка были компаниями с признаками фиктивности, зарегистрированными в Великобритании. Датская юридическая фирма Bruun&Hjejle провела проверку Danske Bank и пришла к выводу, что сотрудники банка сознательно могли быть соучастниками нелегальных операций. Также в банке не контролировалось отмывание денег, там не знали владельцев многих счетов и не имели автоматического мониторинга входных транзакций. Более того, банк даже не выяснял, находятся ли клиенты под санкциями. В 2022 году Danske Bank признал себя виновным в сговоре с целью совершения банковского мошенничества. Признал, что предоставлял банковские услуги подозрительным клиентам — в том числе и в стране-агрессоре — через свой эстонский филиал, хотя знал о рисках отмывания денег. ## Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом Американский политтехнолог, экс-глава избирательной кампании Дональда Трампа — Пол Манафорт был разоблачен и осужден за отмывание средств, полученных за работу консультантом украинской Партии регионов, ее лидера и экс-президента Украины Виктора Януковича, а также Оппозиционного блока. Манафорт вместе с коллегой Ричардом Гейтсом в период с 2006 по 2015 годы заработали в Украине десятки миллионов долларов. С целью скрыть эти деньги, они в течение 2006−2016 годов отмывали средства через многочисленные компании, партнерства и банки в США и других странах. Манафорт и Гейтс действовали как агенты правительства Украины, Партии регионов, Януковича, не задекларировав в США эту деятельность и заработанные вследствие нее средства должным образом. Заметим, что по американскому законодательству такая деятельность является лоббированием в пользу иностранного государства и требует государственной регистрации. По подозрениям ФБР, Манафорт получил от «Партии регионов» и от россии 80−100 млн долларов. По данным обвинения, политтехнолог использовал миллионы долларов незадекларированных и не облагаемых налогом средств для роскошной жизни и покупки дорогой недвижимости в США. То же делал и Гейтс, также помогавший Манафорту получать эти средства с оффшорных счетов. В общей сложности через эти оффшорные счета прошло более 75 млн долларов. В обвинительном акте Манафорта были перечислены десятки компаний, созданных им вместе с Гейтсом, и сотни денежных переводов от этих компаний в пользу обоих деятелей, использованные в их схеме. В марте 2019 года Манафорт был приговорен почти к 4 годам тюрьмы за мошенничество, а впоследствии — еще к 3,5 годам за отмывание денег, препятствование правосудию и несообщение о лоббистской работе. В том же году международная журналистская организация OCCRP установила, что Янукович и Манафорт принимали участие в отмывании средств через Swedbank. Янукович вывел с помощью банка минимум 3,6 млн долларов. ## Liberty Reserve Основанная в США компания Liberty Reserve была аналогом платежной системы PayPal, но для тех, у кого нет счета в банке. В рекламе компания называла себя «самой большой системой платежей и денежных переводов». Впоследствии федеральные прокуроры назвали Liberty Reserve одной из самых крупных в истории «прачечных» для отмывания денег. Согласно судебным документам, компания отмыла в общей сложности около 8 млрд долларов. Принцип работы Liberty Reserve был такой: 1. Для создания учетной записи не требуется никакой информации, кроме адреса электронной почты. 2. Чтобы положить деньги на счет, нужно купить местную валюту через обменник в интернете. 3. За перевод денег со счета в Liberty Reserve на счет в другой системе компания получает 1% от суммы транзакции. За дополнительные 75 центов можно было купить анонимный перевод — сервис открыл номер кошелька, из которого поступал перевод. Анонимность платежей в Liberty Reserve привлекла кардеров (угонщиков данных с **[кредитных карт](https://finance.ua/cards/credit-a)**. — Ред.), продавцов нелегальных данных, организаторов финансовых пирамид и других, кто вел не совсем честный бизнес. Однако среди аккаунтов владельцев в Liberty Reserve были и добросовестные пользователи. В общей сложности в платежной системе было зарегистрировано около 5 млн аккаунтов. Основатель Liberty Reserve — бывший киевлянин Артур Будовский — в 2016 году был приговорен к 20 годам заключения. Суд признал его виновным в использовании компании для проведения огромной многонациональной операции по отмыванию денег. Прокурор Прит Бхарара назвал Liberty Reserve «банком преступного мира». Для тех, кто зарабатывает свои деньги нелегально, отмывание средств является необходимым способом избежать уголовного преследования, тратя в то же время свои нелегальные доходы. Но эта многоуровневая финансовая схема часто приводит к краху, поскольку огромные суммы денег никогда не остаются тайной надолго.

An investigation by Danish law firm Bruun&Hjejle found that Danske Bank employees may have knowingly participated in illegal activities, and the bank failed to control money laundering, did not know the owners of many accounts, and lacked automated transaction monitoring.

Новости стран мира О мерах Резервного банка ЮАР к Capitec Bank 1 января 2025 года опубликована информация о применении Резервным банком ЮАР к крупнейшему южноафриканскому банку Capitec Bank1 штрафных санкций за нарушение требований законодательства в сфере ПОД/ФТ. По результатам проведённой проверки в деятельности банка выявлены нарушения, связанные с ненадлежащим исполнением обязанностей по применению мер НПК (усиленных мер НПК), в частности, с нарушениями проводилась идентификация клиентов и бенефициарных владельцев клиентов, не применялись меры по установлению источника происхождения их средств, в установленные сроки не направлялись в ПФР СПО и СПД. Сумма штрафа за нарушения противолегализационного законодательства для банка составила более 56 млн южноафриканских рэндов (более 260 млн рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, банку объявлен выговор.

О решении Министерства юстиции США в отношении активов Danske Bank A.S. 7 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о решении передать Эстонии часть активов, конфискованных в рамках дела об ОД с участием эстонского подразделения крупнейшего датского банка Danske Bank A.S. (Danske Bank Estonia)3. В соответствии с заключённым с Минюстом США соглашением за содействие и существенный вклад Эстонии в проведение расследования в отношении Danske Bank Estonia американскими властями стране будет возвращена сумма в размере 50 млн долларов США (более 4,2 млрд рублей в эквиваленте) для целей совершенствования национальной системы противодействия финансовым преступлениям (особенно ОД/ФТ, мошенничеству и киберпреступности), развития программ обучения специалистов в противолегализационной сфере, а также криминалистической экспертизы цифровых данных и проведения кампаний по повышению осведомлённости населения о финансовых преступлениях.

О совместном докладе ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в Италии 7 января 2025 года опубликован доклад о результатах совместного исследования ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в стране4. В докладе отмечается, что задача по определению точного размера ОД в стране заведомо представляется труднодостижимой и крайне проблематичной в связи со скрытым характером незаконных финансовых потоков, а также наличием ряда ограничений, связанных с доступными данными и недостатками в применяемых до настоящего времени методологиях оценки. В рамках указанного исследования в целях получения наиболее точной оценки ОД в стране итальянским ПФР и Банком Италии использовалась усовершенствованная методология, предусматривающая процедуру тщательного отбора СПО для анализа содержащихся в них данных, применение специализированного алгоритма машинного обучения для выявления надёжной информации из массива доступных данных и использование метода статистической подборки для вычисления 3 В период 2008-2016 гг. Danske Bank в целях получения максимально возможной прибыли умышленно нарушал требования американского противолегализационного законодательства, содействовал ОД через американскую финансовую систему и в конечном итоге стал представлять собой существенную угрозу для её стабильности. Danske Bank признал ответственность за введение в заблуждение американских банков и проведение через американскую финансовую систему подозрительных операций для высокорисковых клиентов на суммы, исчисляемые в миллиардах долларов США. В 2022 г. по результатам проведённого американскими властями расследования Danske Bank был оштрафован на более чем 2 млрд долларов США (более 204,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). 4 The size of money laundering and other illicit financial conduct for Italy.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже BitMEX 15 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о применении к международной криптовалютной бирже BitMEX5 штрафных санкций в связи с выявленными нарушениями требований Закона США о банковской тайне (BSA/AML)6. По результатам проверки Прокуратуры Южного округа штата Нью-Йорк установлено, что криптовалютной биржей умышленно нарушались требования BSA/AML при оказании услуг американским клиентам. В частности, биржей не была разработана, внедрена и не применялась эффективная программа по ПОД/ФТ. При этом в компании сознательно, c одобрения руководства компании, применялись минимальные требования по идентификации клиентов при принятии их на обслуживание (у клиентов запрашивалась только информация об адресе электронной почты). Топ-менеджмент компании был осведомлён о том, что проживающие на территории США клиенты как минимум с 2018 года пользовались для проведения операций торговой платформой BitMEX. При этом механизмы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ компании были абсолютно неэффективны и позволили BitMEX провести через американскую финансовую систему миллионы долларов США. За умышленное нарушений требований BSA/AML BitMEX выплатит штраф в размере 100 млн долларов США (около 8,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, для биржи установлен двухлетний срок, в течение которого ей предписано устранить выявленные недостатки в части выполнения требований BSA/AML.

KuCoin осуществляла в США нелицензированную деятельность в качестве оператора по переводу денежных средств. Кроме того, в период с 2017 г. по март 2024 г. криптовалютной биржей не выполнялись требования противолегализационного законодательства, связанные с применением мер НПК, информированием ПФР о подозрительных операциях, в результате чего через биржу были проведены подозрительные операции (со средствами, полученными в результате незаконной торговли на площадках даркнет, использования вредоносного программного обеспечения, программ-вымогателей и мошеннических схем) на миллиарды долларов США. Даже после внедрения процедур НПК биржа не смогла обеспечить должным образом идентификацию уже существующих клиентов. Сумма штрафа для компании составила более 297,4 млн долларов США (более 25,1 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Источник информации: официальный сайт Министерства юстиции США в сети Интернет. Об отчёте Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 г. 28 января 2025 года опубликован отчёт Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin) о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 год. К основным рискам, угрожающим стабильности финансового сектора Германии (наряду с рисками, связанными с уязвимостями сектора недвижимости; рисками невозврата кредитов юридическими лицами; рисками кибербезопасности; рисками, связанными с изменениями на финансовом рынке; рисками рыночной концентрации в результате IT аутсорсинга), отнесены риски, связанные с ненадлежащим применением мер в сфере ПОД/ФТ. Приоритетность задач по снижению рисков ОД/ФТ в финансовом секторе Германии продолжает сохраняться на высоком уровне (с учётом того, что 96% всех СПО, поступивших в немецкое ПФР в 2023 г., были направлены представителями финансового сектора). Также BaFin зафиксирован рост рисков, связанных с использованием неофициальных систем по переводу/перемещению денежных средств и ценностей (например, хавала), новых технологий, виртуальных международных номеров банковского счёта (IBAN), криптоактивов.

О руководстве Европола по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями 30 января 2025 года Полицейской службой Европейского союза (Европола) опубликовано руководство по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями в целях противодействия ОД/ФТ и другим финансовым преступлениям10. В руководстве отмечается важная роль государственно-частных партнёрств и иных аналогичных механизмов в обеспечении эффективного взаимодействия между финансовыми организациями, ПФР и следственными органами при проведении расследований преступлений, в частности ОД, в части обмена персональными данными и/или конфиденциальной информацией, связанной с уголовными расследованиями. После вступления в силу нового европейского противолегализационного законодательства стала очевидна ценность такого взаимодействия, которое позволило обмениваться не только данными о типологиях преступлений, но и специфическими данными по конкретным уголовным делам, что способствует повышению эффективности расследований и возврата преступных активов. В настоящее время государственно-частные партнёрства, обеспечивающие обмен информацией по вопросам ПОД, в той или иной форме существуют во всех странах Европы. Однако, механизмы, которые позволяют обмениваться персональными данными, относящимися к конфиденциальным расследованиям правоохранительных органов, существуют11 только в Великобритании, Дании, Ирландии, Латвии, Нидерландах и Швеции. В состав таких механизмов взаимодействия обычно входят: ПФР, полицейские ведомства, прокуратура, налоговые и надзорные органы; значимые (на национальном уровне или с операционной точки зрения) финансовые организации, 9 Пруденциальный надзор за деятельностью De Volksbank (с учётом его значимости для финансового рынка) осуществляет непосредственно ЕЦБ. 10 EFIPPP Practical Guide for Operational Cooperation between Investigative Authorities and Financial Institutions. 11 На момент публикации руководства.

Сотрудничество между компетентными органами и финансовыми организациями может осуществляться в следующих целях: - разработки новых направлений расследования; - обеспечения сбора доказательной базы по текущим расследованиям; - пресечения угроз финансовых преступлений посредством применения превентивных мер; - расширения возможностей финансовых организаций по защите от финансовых преступлений. Отмечается, что следственные органы, как правило, недооценивают тот факт, что финансовые организации играют ключевую роль в качестве «гейткиперов»12 в системе ПОД/ФТ при выявлении незаконных финансовых потоков и обладают всесторонними компетенциями и эффективными цифровыми решениями, обеспечивающими выявление преступной деятельности. Вместе с тем для того, чтобы наиболее эффективно использовать потенциал частного сектора в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями, представляется возможным изменить характер взаимодействия между компетентными ведомствами и частным сектором, которое в настоящее время в большей степени основано на исполнении частным сектором указаний со стороны государственных органов, и переориентировать его на коллективное системное реагирование на угрозы финансовых преступлений. Это в конечном итоге будет способствовать повышению эффективности уголовных расследований и укреплению потенциала частного сектора в части выявления и предотвращения финансовых преступлений.

Sa succursale estonienne disposait d’un portefeuille de clients internationaux qui recouraient fréquemment à des sociétés écrans, leur permettant de contourner la réglementation fiscale. La banque danoise a fait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment en lien avec une société française dont la gérante a été condamnée en procédure de comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité en janvier 2024. Le 18 septembre 2024, la convention judiciaire d’intérêt publique (“CJIP”) conclue entre le procureur de la République financier et la société Danske Bank A/S a été validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris[1]. Cette dernière faisait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment de fraude fiscale commis en bande organisée, affaire dans laquelle la gérante personne physique d’une société d’import-export, a été condamnée pour blanchiment de [fraude fiscale](https://navacelle.law/fr/expertise/droit-penal-fiscal/) par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris, le 9 janvier 2024[2]. ##### En février 2014, le parquet de Paris a été destinataire d’une plainte pour recel d’escroquerie et blanchiment, du fonds d’investissement Hermitage Capital[3]. En juin 2014, TRACFIN a transféré[4] une note au parquet de Paris, faisant état d’une activité suspecte sur les comptes bancaires de la société française d’import-export Decobat. En effet, au titre de sa mission de service de renseignement, TRACFIN dispose de moyens d’investigation divers lui permettant de recueillir des éléments susceptibles de caractériser une infraction de blanchiment du produit d’une infraction punie d’une peine privative de liberté supérieure à un an ou du financement du terrorisme au sens de l’article L.561-30-1 du Code monétaire et financier[5]. ##### Le 8 juillet 2014, une enquête préliminaire portant notamment sur les activités d’importation en Russie de cette société a été ouverte[6]. Une information judiciaire a par la suite été ouverte le 9 avril 2015 des chefs de fraude fiscale en bande organisée, blanchiment et recel d’escroquerie en bande organisée pour des faits commis en France et de manière indivisible à l’étranger depuis 2008[7]. L’instruction a révélé que la succursale estonienne de la banque danoise, la Sampo Bank, détenait un portefeuille de milliers de clients résidant en dehors de l’Estonie (le “PNR”)[8], qu’elle savait à haut risque en raison des pays de résidence des clients, leur recours fréquent à des sociétés écrans susceptibles de masquer l’identité de leurs bénéficiaires effectifs, de l’expéditeur ou du destinataire des transactions et effectuaient des transactions suspectes[9]. Il apparaissait ainsi que la succursale était dotée d’un dispositif de conformité insuffisant concernant le PNR[10], étant donné qu’il permettait aux clients d’ouvrir des comptes et d’enregistrer des transactions sans contrôle ou diligence raisonnable[11]. L’enquête a ainsi révélé que la gérante de Decobat avait pu ouvrir deux comptes auprès de la Sampo Bank, au nom de deux sociétés écrans, utilisés comme comptes de transit pour contourner les règles fiscales et douanières[12]. En effet, la société Decobat exportait ses marchandises vers la Russie en les vendant à une société de droit russe mais en réalisant via des _brokers_ des déclarations douanières à l’import dans les pays baltes _,_ qui étaient minorées revoyant à la baisse l’évaluation des droits de douanes et de la TVA. La société russe transférait ensuite ses bénéfices au Luxembourg vers des comptes ouverts dans les Îles Vierges britanniques et au Luxembourg par le biais de ses comptes ouverts à la Sampo Bank[13]. Les audits de Danske Bank effectués jusqu’en 2014, ainsi que d’autres procédures de contrôle interne, ont systématiquement conclu à un contrôle des clients jugé satisfaisant, révélant une attitude passive et complaisante de l’entreprise, malgré les alertes de la Financial Supervisory Authority (“FSA”) danoise[14]. L’inefficacité de ces mécanismes a permis à la dirigeante de Decobat, résidente fiscale française, de transférer plus de 3 millions d’euros depuis ses deux autres sociétés vers des comptes au Luxembourg, au nom de sociétés offshore dont elle était la bénéficiaire effective[15]. ##### La Danske Bank A/S était alors été mise en examen pour des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, commis entre 2007 et 2014, aggravés par la circonstance qu’ils étaient perpétrés en bande organisée, utilisant plusieurs intermédiaires dont les opérations visaient uniquement à dissimuler la destination des fonds détournés et à en faire profiter des bénéficiaires à l’étranger[16]. Ces pratiques ont notamment conduit à la condamnation de la banque danoise en 2022, d’abord par les autorités danoises pour manquement aux obligations de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement des activités terroristes, puis par les autorités américaines pour conspiration en vue de commettre une fraude bancaire[17]. En France, la banque danoise a reconnu les faits reprochés, incriminés aux articles 324-1, 324-2, 324-3, 324-4, 324-7, 324-8 et 324-9 du Code pénal[18], lui permettant de bénéficier de la CJIP, alternative aux poursuites dont l’avantage est notamment de limiter l’amende d’intérêt public[19]. Aux termes de la [CJIP négociée](https://www.justice.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2024-09/CJIP_DANSKE_BANK_AS_20240827.pdf) avec le parquet national financier (“PNF”), elle a accepté de payer de la somme de 6 028 799€ au titre de l’amende d’intérêt public[20], après analyse des facteurs majorants, tel que le caractère répété des faits ou l’insuffisance du programme de conformité[21] et minorants, à l’instar des mesures correctives mises en place au sein de la Danske Bank ou encore de sa coopération dans l’enquête[22]. Elle a également consenti à verser 300 000 euros pour indemniser l’État français, dont 10 000 euros pour le préjudice matériel et 290 000 euros pour le préjudice moral[23]. Cette approche se distingue de celle de la Cour de cassation qui a retenu à plusieurs reprises que le délit de blanchiment de fraude fiscale ne cause à l’État aucun préjudice moral susceptible d’être réparé dès lors que le préjudice “_découlant des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, caractérisé par le discrédit jeté sur les politiques de lutte contre le blanchiment_” n’est pas distinct du préjudice causé à l’intérêt général réparé par l’action du ministère public[24]. Sauf à démontrer l’existence d’un préjudice moral autre que celui lié au discrédit, cette CJIP a permis à l’État de bénéficier de la réparation d’un préjudice dont l’existence n’aurait potentiellement pas été reconnue dans le cadre d’un procès devant un Tribunal correctionnel.

The case involved Danske Bank's Estonian branch, which maintained a portfolio of high-risk international clients who frequently used shell companies to evade tax regulations. The bank was investigated for facilitating money laundering activities linked to a French import-export company, whose manager was convicted in January 2024. The investigation revealed that Danske Bank's compliance controls were inadequate, allowing clients to open accounts and conduct transactions without proper due diligence. The CJIP, validated by the Paris Judicial Court on September 18, 2024, required Danske Bank to pay a public interest fine of €6,028,799 and an additional €300,000 in compensation to the French state. The settlement took into account aggravating factors such as repeated offenses and compliance program deficiencies, as well as mitigating factors like corrective measures and cooperation with authorities. Danske Bank also faced previous penalties in Denmark and the US for related AML failures and fraud.

Судя по внутренней переписке, в компании это было поводом для шуток. #### Автор: 12 ноября 2024 г. Март 2013 года. Алексей Аверсон, клиент-менеджер в эстонском Swedbank, только что завершил встречу с потенциальными корпоративными клиентами и получил шутливое сообщение от коллеги: «Как дела на отмывочном рынке?» «Ко мне вчера приходили товарищи отмыватели с золотыми часами. Предлагали сотрудничать», — ответил Аверсон. Он добавил, что Роберт Китт, тогдашний глава отдела по работе с корпоративными клиентами и будущий гендиректор компании, в курсе событий: «Китт почти согласился, а я нет». «Китт согласился? — удивился коллега. Серьезно? Он не осознает риски?» «Его не интересует борьба с отмыванием денег, его интересует бизнес. Он один из нас, пусть будет председателем комитета :)», — отшутился Аверсон. Судя по всему, он говорил о группе банковских менеджеров и руководителей, ответственных за общение с ценными корпоративными клиентами (Китт не ответил на обвинения в сокрытии отмывания денег в банке, Аверсон отказался от подробных комментариев). Это так называемые HRNR-клиенты: высокорисковые компании-нерезиденты, многие из которых ([как позже выявило расследование](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/swedbanks-high-risk-secrets)) контролировали российские олигархи. Они обращались в эстонский Swedbank за помощью с регистрацией и управлением счетами для сложных офшорных сетей, через которые выводили миллионы долларов из России. HRNR-клиенты посодействовали успеху банка: как [сообщали СМИ](https://www.svt.se/special/swedbank/rapporten/) со ссылкой на внутренние документы Swedbank, с 2008 по 2018 год на их долю пришлось более 100 миллиардов евро от общего оборота. Благодаря этому Swedbank стал вторым по величине банком в Эстонии. Все поменялось в 2019 году, когда журналисты шведского телеканала SVT раскрыли, что Swedbank и [Danske Bank](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat/the-contract-factory-inside-danske-bank-estonias-money-laundering-machine) использовали для перемещения средств (суммарно почти шесть миллиардов долларов) через подозрительные счета в странах Балтии. Расследование OCCRP и «Важных историй» показало, что Swedbank помог одному из самых прибыльных клиентов, российскому олигарху и экс-министру Михаилу Абызову, вывести сотни миллионов долларов на офшорные счета на Кипре, Британских Виргинских Островах, в Сингапуре и Белизе. Из них 53 миллиона долларов, как позже установил российский суд, Абызов похитил из двух сибирских энергетических компаний. (С Абызовым не удалось связаться для получения комментариев, поскольку он находится в тюрьме. Когда OCCRP впервые сообщил о его счетах в Swedbank, его адвокат отказался комментировать результаты расследования.) Новости о том, что Swedbank организовал масштабную отмывочную схему для крупных корпоративных клиентов, стали основанием для международного расследования. Шведское разбирательство завершилось лишь в этом году: в сентябре бывшую руководительницу Swedbank Биргитте Боннесен [приговорили](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/swedish-court-sends-ex-ceo-of-swedbank-to-prison) к 15 месяцам тюрьмы. Суд постановил, что Боннесен, которая с 2016 по 2019 год занимала в банке должность гендиректора, а перед этим три года возглавляла отдел по работе с клиентами из стран Балтии, обманывала общественность и акционеров насчет рисков отмывания денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Власти Эстонии надеялись на аналогичный исход, открыв дело в отношении ряда топ-менеджеров, руководителей и сотрудников банка. Однако процесс застопорился, когда выяснилось, что необходимо сотрудничество России. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли, поставив под сомнение способность мировых судов преследовать коррупционеров в случаях, когда требуется содействие России или других авторитарных режимов. Журналисты не могли получить судебные документы, пока дело было открыто. Теперь же в распоряжении Delfi Estonia, партнера OCCRP, оказались следственные документы, согласно которым сотрудники банка систематически нарушали протоколы в сфере обеспечения прозрачности, чтобы помочь российским олигархам, входившим в число главных клиентов, сохранить анонимность. 300 файлов, которые эстонская прокуратура предоставила после запроса на основании Закона о свободе информации, включают отредактированные полицейские записи и внутренние документы из эстонского отделения Swedbank, в том числе письма, переписку и служебные записки. Судя по сообщениям, менеджеры по работе с клиентами вроде Аверсона (зачастую они первыми встречали новых клиентов, и их карьера зависела от удовлетворения клиентских потребностей) открыто обсуждали отмывание денег и даже шутили об этом. «Я бы не открыл ему счет, но чувак принес бутылку Hennessy X.O., — написал Аверсон коллеге в августе 2014 года. — Тогда я решил: “фиг с ним, хоть есть за что”». «Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио, — похвастался другой менеджер о клиенте. — Много отмывают, ничего не боятся». Еще один сотрудник банка написал, что его бывший коллега «по уши погряз в отмывании». Что ж, [наш коллега] В хорошо поработал [с клиентом]. Теперь отправим туда независимую делегацию. В идеале хотелось бы посмотреть без его комментариев, насколько там все прозрачно. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Не пугай там [у клиента] слишком сильно [менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. А то В заверяет, что все прекрасно, а потом появляетесь вы и наводите шухер.)) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ты же там с ним уже был, да? Все же выглядело чисто и прозрачно? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Мне нравится, как звучит «чистое и прозрачное отмывание денег».))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ну на месте разберемся — ни у меня, ни у M\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* нет достойных часов… К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Хехехехе :9))))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Тормози, не так прямо. Все равно все тщательно проверим с Алексеем [Аверсоном]. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Понял. И вам часы нужны. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Я не привередливый) Деньги тоже норм. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Окей. Деньги ликвиднее часов. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. А [клиент] вообще еще активен? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио. Много отмывают, ничего не боятся. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Главное, что ничего не скрывают.)))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Точно, скоро будут платежи подписывать: «отмытые деньги, взятка, грязные деньги». К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. В эстонских следственных документах есть транскрипты коммуникаций между сотрудниками Swedbank. Тут менеджеры по работе с клиентами обсуждают планы банка отправить делегацию к HRNR-клиенту, чтобы проверить его деятельность на «чистоту». Их смешит концепция «прозрачного отмывания денег». Чат переведен (оригинал на смеси русского, эстонского и английского языков), некоторые части сокращены для ясности. Имена клиентов и менеджеров, которые не были подозреваемыми в ходе расследования, скрыты. В эстонском филиале Swedbank отказались комментировать письма и другие материалы, которые получили журналисты, но сказали, что расследование закрыли «за неимением преступления». Они отметили, что на сайте юридической фирмы Clifford Chance, которую в 2019 году банк нанял для расследования возможного отмывания денег, опубликован отчет. Представители Аверсона сообщили, что он сотрудничал со следствием, а теперь хочет оставить события десятилетней давности в прошлом. ## Попав в страны Балтии, Swedbank начал активно набирать клиентов-нерезидентов Swedbank вышел в страны Балтии в 1998 году, купив контрольный пакет банковской группы Hansabank. Десятилетие спустя Swedbank полностью поглотил Hansabank и жаждал развития бизнеса: менеджеры, в особенности русскоговорящие, как Аверсон, активно собирали клиентов. «Swedbank искал нерезидентов, — рассказал Аверсон следователям в сентябре 2020 года. — Нам сказали, что нужно привести сотни или даже тысячи клиентов». Аверсону достался бывший клиент Hansabank — российская компания «Кузбассразрезуголь» (КРУ). КРУ была одним из крупнейших клиентов эстонского Swedbank: капитал предприятия оценивался в сотни миллионов долларов, а его корпоративную сеть составляли почти 200 фирм. Контролировали компанию российские олигархи Андрей Бокарев и Искандер Махмудов. Однако согласно служебной записке, которой Аверсон в 2011 году сопроводил «экстренный» запрос на открытие счетов для развивающейся офшорной сети КРУ, не все фирмы были зарегистрированы на них. Банковский сотрудник объяснил, что КРУ — важный клиент, которому требовались дополнительные офшорные компании, не связанные напрямую с Бокаревым и Махмудовым, для минимизации налогов в России. В 2011 году портфолио Аверсона расширилось: КРУ продала одну из компаний Абызову — мультимиллионеру и близкому соратнику тогдашнего российского президента Дмитрия Медведева. Бизнес-группа Ru-Com Абызова участвовала во многих энергетических, строительных и сельскохозяйственных проектах. Аверсон ездил в Москву, чтобы лично подготовить бумаги для сделки. Через несколько месяцев ему сообщили, что Абызов хочет открыть множество офшорных счетов для Ru-Com. «Клиент обещает внести приличные депозиты в Swedbank», — написал Аверсон коллегам. Близость Абызова к тогдашнему президенту Медведеву делала его «политически значимым лицом» с повышенными коррупционными рисками, а значит, к нему должны были применить усиленный контроль. Однако согласно служебной записке, банковский комитет по работе с HRNR-клиентами без лишних вопросов согласился принять Ru-Com и Абызова — «главного бенефициара компаний-нерезидентов». Как сообщил Аверсон следователям, позже в Swedbank ввели некоторые ограничения касательно подбора клиентов. «Банк не работал с игорными и алкогольными бизнесами, у остальных компаний даже не спрашивали о происхождении активов», — поделился он. Вчера тоже — «Увеличьте мой лимит на 1 млн евро, нужно дать в долг «партнерам». Полный бардак. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Мои или чьи-то еще? А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Нет, нет, это клиенты [клиент-менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Хехе, это фигня. Теперь [клиент по прозвищу] Крокодил перевел 8 миллионов в Россию. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Вот это кредит. Но миллион — это мелочь. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. В разговоре между клиент-менеджером Swedbank Алексеем Аверсоном и коллегой основное внимание уделяется запросу неназванного клиента HRNR на перевод крупной суммы денег. IВ мае 2012 года Медведев, тогда премьер-министр, назначил Абызова министром по делам открытого правительства. Судя по всему, работа в правительстве не помешала бизнесу россиянина. Империя Ru-Com продолжила процветать. Согласно внутреннему документу за январь 2014 года, Swedbank открыл для Ru-Com 53 банковских счета. Хорошие новости вскоре попали в головной офис в Швеции: Китт переслал Боннесен сообщение, в котором Аверсон называет Абызова «одним из самых инновационных бизнесменов в России» и отмечает, что объем депозитов на счетах Ru-Com достиг 30 миллионов евро. ## Схемы с участием КРУ и Ru-Com привлекли внимание банковских контролеров Какое-то время КРУ и Ru-Com были крупнейшими клиентами-нерезидентами эстонского филиала Swedbank, однако к 2016 году в банке засомневались в правильности такого положения дел. Андреас Хоббелин, контролер Swedbank Group из Норвегии, начал задавать вопросы насчет КРУ и того, в какой степени аффилированные предприятия вроде Carbo One (компания по торговле углем, которой официально владели два других бизнесмена) на самом деле контролируют Махмудов и Бокарев. Махмудов тогда засветился в международных медиа в связи со схемой отмывания денег, выявленной в рамках испанской операции против российских преступников, известной как «Тройка». (Махмудов и Бокарев позже попали под санкции Минфина США [за связи с организованной преступностью](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1731).) [Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов](/processed/containers/assets/features/iskander-makhmudov.jpg/ef38d5c485ca2a8a058bda1a06fdd9fd/iskander-makhmudov.jpg) Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов К лету вопросы Хоббелина дошли до Аверсона, которого отправили на Кипр для личной встречи с одним из официальных собственников компании, гражданином Узбекистана. Аверсон позже сообщил, что его собеседник «произвел впечатление адекватного человека, очень спокойного и уверенного». Один из руководителей Swedbank, Хейки Раадик, надеялся, что благодаря неприметным владельцам Carbo One может остаться клиентом компании. При подготовке материалов о Carbo One для контролеров он пытался минимизировать связи компании с российскими олигархами. «Я бы удалил это сообщение: \"Махмудов и Бокарев имеют влияние на компанию, однако нет документальных подтверждений того, что [официальные собственники] — подставные лица\". Постарайтесь о них как можно меньше/короче упоминать», — написал он. Банкир выразил надежду на то, что этот вопрос не дойдет до банковского комитета по этике. Тем не менее в 2017 году Carbo One, Махмудов и Бокарев привлекли внимание Мари-Лийс Кург, начальницы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Кург ранее возглавляла аналогичный отдел в другом крупном эстонском банке, SEB. Swedbank нанял ее для совершенствования работы в сфере прозрачности. Однако все ее требования по соблюдению правил встречали жесткое сопротивление. «Разница в культуре комплаенс-контроля в двух банках меня поразила», — сказала она OCCRP. Обеспокоенная происходящим, Кург направила отчет о подозрительной активности в эстонское подразделение финансовой разведки (FIU) — правительственное агентство, ответственное за расследование случаев отмывания денег и других финансовых преступлений. Она указала, что Махмудов и Бокарев — «истинные бенефициары более 200 клиентов (компаний) в юрисдикциях с низким налогообложением», которых обслуживает Swedbank. «По данным неофициальных источников, клиенты замешаны в коррупционной деятельности и, вероятно, отмывании денег», — написала Кург в сопроводительном письме. В переписке с супервайзерами в Swedbank она предупредила, что дальнейшее сотрудничество с высокорисковыми клиентами вроде Carbo One поставит банк в трудное положение. Ранее в Deutsche Bank, обрабатывавшем некоторые транзакции Swedbank, сказали, что больше не будут принимать платежи «политически значимых лиц». Кург спросила, проходили ли средства Carbo One через Deutsche Bank за последние 18 месяцев. «Если да, вероятно, мы имеем дело с нарушением условий договора», — пояснила она. «Я все выходные переживала», — написала Кург. Получив отчет о подозрительной активности, FIU вызвало на допрос Кург и Свена Киввистика, тогдашнего главу отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в странах Балтии. Судя по внутренней переписке, руководители Swedbank забеспокоились. Китт назвал ситуацию «болезненной. Очень болезненной». «Мы имеем дело не с копами-новичками, — написал Киввистик, отметив, что один из следователей имел за плечами опыт более двадцати лет работы в полиции. — Его точно нельзя недооценивать». Менеджеры банка просчитывали, как Киввистику лучше общаться с FIU, чтобы минимизировать последствия показаний Кург. «Вопрос в том, как нейтрализовать активного и глупого человека, перед которым сидят опытные следователи, — написал Китт Киввистику о Кург. — Они сразу поймут по языку тела, если ты попытаешься ее оговорить». Кург говорит, что вскоре после допроса в FIU ее уволили. «Это был очень сложный период в моей карьере, — поделилась она. — Я не могла объяснить внезапное увольнение». Киввистик отказался от комментариев. ## Российский приговор Абызова помог Swedbank избежать наказания в Эстонии Судя по всему, в эстонском Swedbank поняли, что продолжать отношения с крупнейшим HRNR-клиентом — плохая идея, и в конце 2016 года прекратили сотрудничать с компаниями Ru-Com. К моменту, когда Кург направила отчет властям, та же участь постигла КРУ. Когда Swedbank дистанцировался от КРУ и Ru-Com, Аверсон — клиент-менеджер, который был ключевым звеном в работе с ними, — покинул банк и нашел нового работодателя — Абызова. Будучи директором одной из кипрских компаний россиянина, Аверсон отвечал за руководство [элитными активами](https://youtu.be/y35SmhHa4jA) Il Tesoro в Тоскане, включающими несколько вилл, теннисный корт, виноградники, оливковые рощи и вертолетную площадку. Сам Абызов в 2018 году покинул Россию, не получив второй срок в должности министра. В следующем году в ходе короткой поездки домой его арестовали и обвинили в хищении более 53 миллионов долларов из сибирских энергетических холдингов и выводе средств за границу. В декабре 2023 года его приговорили к 12 годам тюрьмы. Официальное расследование в отношении банка в Эстонии открыли в июле 2019 года. В центре внимания оказался тот факт, что Swedbank обманывал банки-корреспонденты и следователей, скрывая, что Абызов был главным бенефициаром структур Ru-Com. В 2015 году, когда в FIU запросили данные о владельцах нескольких фирм Ru-Com, эстонский филиал предоставил имена номинальных владельцев — хотя, как подтверждает переписка Аверсона, в банке знали, что за компаниями стоял Абызов. Два года спустя правоохранители отправили еще один запрос. Судя по утечке, банковский сотрудник обратился к коллеге за советом: «Знаю, что у тебя какие-то договоренности с Туулингом (Тоомас Туулинг — предшественник Кург на должности главы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег) касательно того, что некоторых нельзя называть, чтобы они сохранили анонимность». (Туулинг сообщил OCCRP, что это неправда, и у него «не было договоренностей с целью скрыть личность клиента или утаить информацию от властей». Он сказал, что банк не предоставил FIU информацию об Абызове, поскольку данные о бенефициарах держали отдельно от общей клиентской базы, доступной сотням сотрудников, чтобы защитить важных клиентов от возможных утечек. «Вне зависимости от того, где хранили информацию, менеджеры обязаны были передавать точные данные Комитету по работе с высокорисковыми клиентами», — добавил он.) Арест Абызова был важен для эстонского следствия, ведь требовалось доказать, что деньги, которые, предположительно, отмывали в Swedbank, — это доходы от преступной деятельности (в Эстонии, как и во многих других странах, даже при веских доказательствах отмывание денег не считается правонарушением без наличия предикатного преступления). Юридическая фирма Clifford Chance, которую Swedbank нанял после скандала 2019 года, установила, что с 2014 по 2019 год через эстонский филиал прошло более 21 миллиарда евро подозрительных транзакций. Однако в центре эстонского расследования оказалась лишь малая часть этой суммы — 53 миллиона долларов, которые, как установили правоохранители, провели через счета Абызова, прежде чем вывести на Кипр или обратно в Россию. Однако российский приговор олигарха предоставил адвокатам Swedbank уникальную возможность: они заявили, что Абызов — жертва политически мотивированного разбирательства, поскольку судья, который вел его дело, также вынес решения в пользу правительства в двух громких разбирательствах в отношении борцов с коррупцией. Защита настаивала на том, что Абызов может быть очередной жертвой кремлевского преследования. Доводы защиты о предвзятости приговора поставили правоохранителей в уязвимое положение: им требовались судебные документы из России. Из-за санкций и войны в Украине двустороннее сотрудничество между странами остановлено, и подать соответствующий запрос невозможно. Несмотря на наличие существенных доказательств обработки подозрительных транзакций, слабого документирования и контроля в Swedbank, а также компрометирующих внутренних коммуникаций, власти не смогли довести до конца один из самых громких скандалов вокруг отмывания денег в Эстонии. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли. ### Что делать, если отмывают деньги из «захваченного государства»? Эксперты по борьбе с коррупцией говорят, что произошедшее в эстонском филиале Swedbank вызывает опасения касательно возможности расследовать случаи отмывания денег c участием изолированных стран или государств под санкциями вроде России. «Это обычная ситуация, — говорит юрист Transparency International Куш Амин. — Правоохранители, которые просят правовой помощи у захваченного государства, понимают, что, скорее всего, не добьются уровня сотрудничества, необходимого для доказательства предикатного преступления к отмыванию средств. Особенно если в деле замешаны высокопоставленные чиновники или физические и юридические лица со связями в политике». Амин рассказал, что во Франции придумали возможное решение этой проблемы. Там доказательства требуют не от обвинения, а от защиты: необходимо обосновать легальность подозрительных транзакций. «Эта тактика, так называемая опровержимая презумпция, предоставляет правоохранителям лазейку в случае, если предикатное преступление совершено в стране, которая не готова сотрудничать, — говорит Амин. — Введение опровержимой презумпции — один из вариантов решения проблем, связанных, например, с отслеживанием нелегальных финансовых потоков из России». По мнению Алара Лехесметса, представителя эстонской прокуратуры, опровержимая презумпция может повысить успешность будущих расследований. «Однако пока, насколько мы знаем, законодатели не предпринимали шагов в этом направлении», — отметил он. Как говорит Маркко Кюннапу, советник в Минюсте Эстонии, получить доказательства из России было непросто и до того, как война в Украине прервала сотрудничество между странами. Тем не менее, несмотря на неудачу с Swedbank, он считает, что расследовать случаи отмывания денег с предикатными преступлениями в России возможно. ## Многие причастные к расследованию сотрудники Swedbank ушли из банковской сферы Многие банкиры, причастные к делу Swedbank, сменили сферу деятельности. Бывший гендиректор банка Китт возглавляет теплоснабжающую компанию. Состоявший в правлении Раадик — финдиректор Таллинского технического университета. Оба отказались от подробных комментариев из соображений защиты конфиденциальности. «Разбирательство было долгим; если бы у прокуратуры были ко мне какие-то претензии, дело бы не закрыли», — сообщил Раадик OCCRP. Китт сказал, что попавшие к журналистам файлы — «версия одной стороны, то есть обвинения». Адвокат Аверсона говорит, что его клиент сотрудничал со следствием. «Аверсон хочет оставить прошлое позади. Он работает в Эстонии, платит налоги и заботится о своей семье», — добавил он. Представительница эстонского филиала Swedbank сказала, что финансовое учреждение «полностью сотрудничало» с прокуратурами Эстонии и Швеции. Она добавила, что банк «неуклонно соблюдает» протоколы противодействия отмыванию денег. «Swedbank в числе банков с наименьшим уровнем риска на местном рынке и ориентирован на обслуживание местных клиентов», — сказала она. Кург, экс-контролер в Swedbank, руководит частным стартапом в сфере управления рисками. Она говорит, что произошедшее ее не отпускает. «Важно помнить, что контролеры работают не против компании, а преследуют более глобальную цель: защитить бизнес и минимизировать риски, последствия которых могут оказаться разрушительными, — пояснила она. — К сожалению, в случае Swedbank риски материализовались». 12 ноября 2024 г. 12 ноября 2024 г. ### **Присоединяйтесь.** **Привлеките власть к ответу.** [Поддержать](https://membership.occrp.org/accomplice) Поддержка читателей помогает OCCRP разоблачать организованную преступность и коррупцию по всему миру.

Das unter Führung der S&D-Fraktion ausgehandelte Gesetzespaket wird die Spielregeln stark verändern und dazu beitragen, Skandale zu verhindern, wie wir sie in den letzten Jahren nur allzu oft erlebt haben. Das übergeordnete Ziel der neuen Rechtsvorschriften ist die Vereinheitlichung der geltenden nationalen Regeln – die zu fragmentiert und nicht gut aufeinander abgestimmt sind –, mit dem Ziel, die Vorschriften besser durchsetzen zu können und den gemeinsamen Kampf gegen Geldwäsche zu verstärken. Die Bedeutung der neuen Regeln lässt sich anhand einiger konkreter Beispiele illustrieren: Für Superreiche, zu denen auch russische Oligarchen zählen, wird es sehr viel schwerer, das System zu überlisten und Kontrollen zu umgehen. Die Vorschriften dienen außerdem dazu, im Fußball aufzuräumen, und die Risiken einzudämmen, die aus der Vergabe „goldener Visa“ resultieren. **Eero** **Heinäluoma, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Wirtschaftsausschuss, sagte:** „Heute ist ein guter Tag für die Bürger und Unternehmen in der EU und ein schlechter Tag für Oligarchen und Terroristen. Die lang erwartete Reform war angesichts der Skandale in den letzten Jahren, an denen die Danske Bank und die Credit Suisse beteiligt waren, und der jüngsten Enthüllungen aus Zypern wahrhaft notwendig. Die neuen Regeln werden die Dunkelmänner hinter undurchsichtigen rechtlichen Strukturen ans Licht bringen. Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt zu mehr Unternehmenstransparenz. Sie gilt auch für Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU: Falls diese in der EU Geschäfte machen wollen, müssen sie ihre Eigentumsverhältnisse im Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer offenlegen. Da bei der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung Bargeld eine große Rolle spielt, werden Barzahlungen über 10.000 Euro in der EU verboten. Dadurch können Transaktionen mithilfe hoher Geldbeträge besser kontrolliert werden, um Geldwäsche zu verhindern.“ **Paul Tang, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Justizausschuss, meinte:** „Eins unserer Hauptziele war, dafür zu sorgen, dass Wirtschaftskriminelle nicht länger durch den Kauf teurer Autos, Jachten und Privatflugzeuge Geldwäsche betreiben können. Die neuen Vorschriften erschweren es den Reichen und Mächtigen, ohne richtige Kontrollen in der EU zu investieren und Sanktionen zu umgehen, da ihre Prestigeobjekte nun den Behörden gemeldet werden müssen. Durch diese historische Einigung entstehen das erste einheitliche europäische Regelwerk zur Geldwäschebekämpfung und eine neue EU-Behörde mit umfassenden Kontroll- und Koordinierungsbefugnissen. Nicht nur der Finanz-, sondern auch der Nichtfinanzsektor wird künftig wesentlich strengeren Regeln und einer verstärkten Aufsicht unterworfen. Wichtig ist, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten.“ **Hinweis für die Redaktion:** Das Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket besteht aus einer Verordnung und einer Richtlinie zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung sowie einer Verordnung zur Errichtung einer neuen EU-Behörde, deren Aufgabe es sein wird, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung zu unterbinden. Über die letztgenannte Verordnung wurde bereits letzten Monat Einigkeit erzielt, während der Rest des Pakets gestern Abend festgezurrt wurde. **Hier eine Liste der wichtigsten von der S&D-Fraktion durchgesetzten Punkte in dem Paket:** **In der Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Erweiterung der Liste von Einrichtungen, die die Vorschriften befolgen müssen, um hochrangige Profifußballvereine und -agenten, Anbieter von Kryptowerten, Vermittler von „goldenen Visa“ sowie Personen, die mit Luxusgütern handeln. Da das Fußballgeschäft und seine Risiken in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten jedoch sehr unterschiedlich sind, können für kleinere Vereine Ausnahmen gelten, falls das Risiko nachweislich gering ist und sie von der Kommission genehmigt werden.

Согласно договоренности, полученные от США миллионы направляются на профилактику, выявление и расследование финансовых преступлений, включая отмывание денег, киберпреступления и финансирование терроризма. Соглашение одновременно укрепляет взаимодействие Эстонии и США в противодействии финансовым преступлениям и подчеркивает нашу совместную приверженность принципам правового государства во всем мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов курирует комиссия, в состав которой входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом конкурсном раунде поддержаны девять предложений на общую сумму 25,7 млн евро. Комиссия исходила из того, что проекты должны представлять собой логическое целое и усиливать потенциал не отдельных учреждений, а системно укреплять борьбу с финансовой преступностью. Целью является поддержка профилактики, совершенствование практик расследования, технологическая поддержка и устойчивое обучение. Это поможет обеспечить осведомленность специалистов, работающих в столь сложной сфере, о последних достижениях, рисках и технологических изменениях, а также способность успешно применять полученные навыки и знания. Инициативы нацелены на предупреждение коррупции, повышение осведомленности о финансовых мошенничествах, эффективное выявление, арест и конфискацию преступных доходов, наращивание потенциала в борьбе с киберпреступлениями, улучшение возможностей по выявлению и анализу доходов от криптоактивов, а также на укрепление финансового надзора для более эффективного противодействия отмыванию денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент полиции безопасности, Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция и все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. «То, что штрафные средства по делам об отмывании денег направляются на проекты по сокращению экономической преступности, имеет символическое значение. Поскольку финансовые преступления крайне специфичны, сложны и технически емки, особенно важно, что благодаря этим ресурсам мы сможем усилить возможности следователей, прокуроров и судей эффективно рассматривать такие дела», - сказала канцлер Министерства юстиции и цифровых дел Тийна Уудеберг. «Показательно и то, что часть средств направляется непосредственно на профилактику, в том числе создается стратегическая рамка для предотвращения коррупции», - добавила она. Канцлер Министерства внутренних дел Тармо Мийлитс отметил, что дополнительные ресурсы позволят совершить важный рывок в расследовании технически сложных, как правило требующих международного сотрудничества и наносящих большой ущерб киберпреступлений. «Доходы от киберпреступности занимают высокое место рядом с оборотом наркотиков и коррупцией, поэтому особенно важно опережать преступников на шаг в навыках, знаниях и технических возможностях», - подчеркнул он. «Не менее важно выстроить устойчивую систему обучения, чтобы развитие компетенций в расследовании финансовых преступлений стало одним из столпов борьбы с преступностью. Совместно реализуемые проекты сделают работу правоохранительных органов эффективнее, чтобы поиск, арест и конфискация имущества, связанного с преступлениями, были результативнее, а снижение прибыльности преступной деятельности - успешнее», - указал Мийлитс. Министерство финансов акцентировало внимание на наращивании потенциала Финансовой инспекции по предотвращению отмывания денег. «Благодаря проектам у налоговой службы появится возможность получать сведения о транзакциях с криптоактивами, чтобы взыскивать неуплаченные налоги и обмениваться данными для выявления связанных преступлений», - сказала канцлер Министерства финансов Мерике Сакс. «Очень хорошо, что проекты предусматривают и информирование общества, и профилактику, например, чтобы люди не становились жертвами финансовых мошенничеств», - подчеркнула она.

Кроме того, средства будут использованы для повышения осведомлённости о финансовых и киберпреступлениях, а также для развития процедур по аресту и конфискации преступных доходов, в том числе в рамках международного сотрудничества. Соглашение также укрепляет сотрудничество между Эстонией и США в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями и демонстрирует, что обе страны совместно отстаивают принципы правового государства во всём мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов координирует комиссия, в которую входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел Эстонии, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом туре проектов было поддержано девять инициатив на общую сумму 25,7 миллиона евро. При отборе комиссия исходила из принципа, что проекты должны образовывать логически связанное целое и усиливать потенциал не только отдельных учреждений, но и системно укреплять борьбу с финансовыми преступлениями. Целью было обеспечить, чтобы проекты способствовали как профилактике, так и совершенствованию следственной практики, технологической поддержке и устойчивой системе обучения. Это поможет гарантировать, что в столь сложной сфере работают специалисты, хорошо осведомлённые о последних тенденциях, рисках и технологических изменениях, и способные эффективно применять полученные знания и навыки. Проекты направлены на предотвращение коррупции, повышение осведомлённости о финансовом мошенничестве, улучшение выявления, ареста и конфискации преступных доходов, укрепление возможностей по борьбе с киберпреступностью, повышение потенциала по выявлению и анализу криптодоходов, а также на усиление финансового надзора для более эффективной борьбы с отмыванием денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются Прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент государственной безопасности (КАПО), Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция, а также все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. _Читайте по теме:_ [**Цахкна: Передача штрафных денег доказывает глубину

Nov. 2017 | 09:00 Uhr | von Gerd Mischler Aktualisiert am: 16. Jan. 2024 ## Wirecard, Siemens, VW # Die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale in Deutschland Manager-Versagen oder kriminelle Energie: Für diese 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale mussten die Beteiligten oft beides aufbringen. Diese Firmen waren mit besonderem „Engagement“ dabei. Können Sie sich noch erinnern? Schon so einige deutsche Unternehmen und Manager haben Negativschlagzeilen gemacht. Wir haben die größten Skandale für Sie zusammengestellt. (Bild: Goss Vitalij - stock.adobe.com) Ob Steuerbetrug, Schneeballsystem oder großflächige Bilanzfälschung: Deutsche Unternehmen haben sich in der Vergangenheit einiges einfallen lassen, um in die (negativen) Schlagzeilen zu kommen. Wir haben die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale zusammengetragen – garantiert subjektiv und ausdrücklich nicht wertfrei. #### Platz 10: Arcandor – Thomas Middelhoff veruntreut Millionen Obwohl es ihm nicht gelungen war, den Handelskonzern Arcandor und seine Töchter Karstadt, Quelle, Primondo und Thomas Cook zu retten, lässt sich Vorstandschef Thomas Middelhoff kurz vor der Pleite im Jahr 2009 rund 2,3 Millionen Euro Bonus auszahlen. Dafür wurde er wegen Veruntreuung zu drei Jahren Haft verurteilt, von denen er zwei absitzen musste. Middelhoff pendelte außerdem auf Firmenkosten für 1,1 Millionen Euro mit dem Hubschrauber von seiner Villa in Bielefeld zur Arbeit in die Essener Arcandorzentrale und ließ sich mit Privatjets in seine Villa in St. Tropez und nach New York fliegen. Einen Beigeschmack hinterließ auch der Verkauf von fünf Immobilien an einen Fonds, an dem Middelhoff und seine Frau beteiligt waren. Der Fonds vermietete die fünf Kaufhäuser für durchschnittlich gut 8,5 Millionen Jahresmiete an Karstadt. Für ihre 164 anderen Filialen zahlte die Kette dagegen nur jeweils 1,7 Millionen Euro Miete. #### Platz 9: Mannesmann-Vodafone – Abfindungsaffäre bei Übernahme Der Deal ist perfekt. Am 4. Februar 2000 stimmt nach einer spektakulären Abwehrschlacht der Mannesmann-Aufsichtsrat der Übernahme des Industriekonzerns durch Vodafone für 178 Milliarden Euro zu. Noch am selben Tag verteilen im Aufsichtsratsausschuss für Vorstandsangelegenheiten Deutsche-Bank-Vorstand Josef Ackermann, Mannesmann-Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Funk und IG-Metall-Boss Klaus Zwickel 30 Millionen Euro „Anerkennungsprämien“ an Topmanager bei Mannesmann. Obwohl eine Stuttgarter Kanzlei deshalb am 24. Februar 2000 Anzeige wegen des Verdachts auf Untreue erstattet, verteilt der Ausschuss im März weitere 32 Millionen Euro an bereits pensionierte Mannesmann-Vorstände. Das Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf spricht Ackermann, Funk und Zwickel zunächst vom Vorwurf der Untreue frei. Später hebt der Bundesgerichtshof das Urteil auf. Im zweiten Anlauf wird das Verfahren gegen eine Zahlung von 5,8 Millionen Euro eingestellt. ## Platz 8: Flowtex - Schneeballsystem mit fiktiven Bohrmaschinen In den 90er Jahren betrog der badische Unternehmer Manfred Schmider Banken und Versicherungen um rund zwei Milliarden Euro. Seine Firma Flowtex produzierte Horizontalbohrsysteme, mit denen man unterirdisch Kabel verlegt, ohne die Straßen aufzureißen. Flowtex verkaufte zahlreiche dieser Systeme an Investoren und leaste sie anschließend zurück. Dieses Vorgehen ist an sich nicht unüblich, nur dass in diesem Fall die meisten der Geräte gar nicht existierten. Das Unternehmen täuschte einen hohen Bestand an Bohrern vor, indem es an die wenigen real exisiterenden Systeme immer neue Seriennummern schraubte. Um die Leasingraten zahlen zu können, musste die Firma im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr fiktive Maschinen verkaufen – es war ein Schneeballsystem. Im Februar 2000, nur Tage vor dem geplanten Börsengang, wurden Schmider und weitere Verantwortliche festgenommen. Er war sieben Jahre in Haft, bevor er auf Bewährung entlassen wurde. Im Jahr 2016 wurde er in der Schweiz dann erneut zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt - wegen Geldwäsche. ## Das sind die 6 größten Schneeballsysteme der Geschichte 1. **Madoff Investment Securities**. Anlageverluste: 60 Milliarden Euro - Die nach ihrem Gründer Bernhard Madoff benannte Investmentfirma galt lange Zeit als einer der zuverlässigsten Partner an der Wall Street. Allerdings stellte sich 40 Jahre später heraus, dass Madoff die Renditen seiner Kunden mit den Einlagen neuer Kunden bezahlte. Seine Söhne zeigten ihn schließlich an und ein Gericht verurteilte ihn zu 150 Jahren Gefängnis. Sein Betrug betraf Millionen von Menschen und trieb etliche in den Selbstmord. 2. **MMM.** Anlageverluste: Über 1,85 Milliarden Euro - 1989 gründete Sergey Mavrodi in Moskau mit seinem Bruder und seiner Frau MMM. Das Unternehmen verkaufte sehr erfolgreich Bürogeräte, bis Probleme mit dem Finanzamt auftraten. Daraufhin wechselte MMM in den Finanzsektor und gab alsbald eigene Aktien heraus. Diese wurden ohne erkennbaren Grund stetig teurer. Die Zahl der Anleger stieg rapide an, nachdem eine Rendite von bis zu 1.000 Prozent kolportiert wurde. Innerhalb von sechs Monaten stieg der Wert der Wertpapiere um das 127-fache. Im Jahr 1994 versprach das Unternehmen Dividenden in Höhe von 3.000 Prozent pro Jahr. Allerdings wurden die hohen Zinsen auf alte Einlagen immer nur durch das Anziehen neuer Einlagen finanziert. Als das Geld nicht mehr ausreichte, reduzierte MMM die Papiere auf den Ausgabewert. Das System brach zusammen. Unmittelbar nach dieser Nachricht begingen 50 Menschen Selbstmord. Mavrodi wurde verhaftet und verurteilt. Seine Machenschaften betrafen rund 15 Millionen Menschen. 3. **Stanford International Bank**. Anlageverlust: 7,4 Milliarden Euro - Der erfolglose Immobilienmakler Robert Allen Stanford gründete 1986 in Antigua und Barbuda die Stanford International Bank. Diese Bank gab Einlagenzertifikate als Alternative zu einer Einlage aus und warb mit Renditen weit über dem Marktwert. Die Einlagen schienen durch das Vermögen gedeckt zu sein, da Stanford die Bilanzen der Bank frisierte. Die hohen Zinsen auf die Einlagenzertifikate wurden tatsächlich nur durch das Geld neuer Anleger gezahlt. Dies funktionierte 23 Jahre lang, bis Robert Allen Stanford im Jahr 2012 wegen Betrugs zu einer Haftstrafe von 110 Jahren verurteilt wurde. 4. **European Kings Club**. Anlageverlust: 1 Milliarde Euro´- Der Fall \\'European Kings Club\\' war das größte europäische Schneeballsystem und war von 1992 bis 1994 im DACH-Bereich aktiv. Der Klub sollte seinen Mitgliedern, KMU-Unternehmern, finanzielle Unterstützung bieten. Um Mitglied zu werden, musste man sich einen Anteil für umgerechnet 715 Euro kaufen. Dafür sollten dann jeden Monat etwa 102 Euro ausgezahlt werden - natürlich mit den Anteilserlösen der neuesten Mitglieder. Das funktionierte, bis die Behörden die Gründerin des Clubs, Damara Bertges, und ihren Partner verhafteten. Die Finanzämter beschlagnahmten 255,6 Millionen Euro und gaben sie an die Investoren zurück. 5. **Caritas / John Stoica**. Anlageverluste: 930 Millionen Euro - Innerhalb eines Jahres betrog John Stoica mit seiner Firma Caritas (die Namensgleichheit mit der karitativen kirchlichen Organisation war beabsichtigt) rund 4 Millionen Rumänen. Er versprach Zinsen von 800 Prozent in 3 Monaten. Sogar Teile der Regierung und Verwaltung unterstützten das Unternehmen. Das Schneeballsystem brach schnell zusammen. Viele Rumänen hatten investiert und es bestand die Furcht vor Straßenprotesten und weiteren Reaktionen wütender Investoren. Caritas nahm etwa 3 Milliarden US-Dollar ein und besaß auf dem Höhepunkt des Erfolgs ein Drittel aller rumänischen Banknoten. John Stoica verbrachte 1,5 Jahre im Gefängnis. 6. **Mutual Benefits Corporation**. Anlageverluste: 1,15 Milliarden Euro - Im Jahr 1994 gründete Joel Steinger die Mutual Benefits Corporation, obwohl die US-Börsenaufsichtsbehörde den Verkauf von Wertpapieren bereits verboten hatte. Die Vorgehensweise war folgende: Die Mutual Benefits Corporation kaufte Versicherungspolicen von Patienten mit unheilbaren Krankheiten, verkaufte sie an Dritte weiter und wurde zum Vermittler zwischen der Versicherungsgesellschaft und den neuen Eigentümern. Diese zahlten monatliche Beiträge und sollten im Gegenzug einen guten Prozentsatz der Sterbegeldzahlung erhalten. Das Unternehmen lieferte falsche Berichte über die Krankheiten der Versicherungsnehmer. Da jedoch kaum jemand tatsächlich starbst, wurden mit dem Geld neuer Investoren alte Investoren bezahlt. Im Jahr 2001 übergab ein Mitarbeiter von Mutual Benefits Informationen an die Polizei. Joel Steinger wurde daraufhin im Jahr 2014 zu 20 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. #### Platz 7: MAN – Schmiergeldauszahlungen in bar Dreist: Wer im Dienste der Volkswagentochter bis 2009 Kunden schmieren wollte, ließ sich die erforderliche Summe in bar an der Kasse auszahlen. Später verschleierte der Münchner Nutzfahrzeughersteller die Korruption mit Briefkastenfirmen und Scheinverträgen mit vermeintlichen Beratern in Slowenien und Liechtenstein. Die insgesamt rund 50 Millionen Schmiergelder schlug [MAN](https://www.produktion.de/schwerpunkte/mega-maschinen/man-und-basf-wollen-die-groesste-waermepumpe-der-welt-bauen-691.html) auf den Preis für seine Busse und Lkw drauf. So ließen sich die Münchner den Betrug von den Steuerzahlern in den Abnehmerstaaten finanzieren. Im Jahr 2009 flogen die Machenschaften auf. Die Affäre kostete MAN über 250 Millionen Euro – größter Posten war mit 150,6 Millionen Euro die Geldbuße der Staatsanwaltschaft. #### Platz 6: Scania - Rekord-Bußgeld für LKW-Kartell 1997 bis 2010 sprachen sich mehrere europäische LKW-Hersteller über Preise ab und über die Einführung neuer Emissionstechnologien sowie die Weitergabe der damit verbundenen Kosten. Die ersten Treffen der leitenden Manager:innen fanden in Brüssel und auf Messen statt. Später verlagerte sich die Organisation zu den Tochterunternehmen der deutschen Hersteller. MAN ließ das Kartell schließlich auffliegen und ging als Kronzeuge straffrei aus, während die anderen Hersteller Geldbußen zahlen mussten. DAF, Daimler Iveco und Volvo/Renault teilten sich eine Rekord-Kartellbuße von insgesamt 2,93 Milliarden Euro. Scania arbeitete nicht mit den Ermittlern zusammen und büßte deshalb in einem getrennten Verfahren mit 880 Millionen Euro. #### Platz 5: Siemens – Größter Schmiergeldskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte Am 15. November 2006 durchsuchen Fahnder Büros an 30 [Siemens](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft/175-jahre-siemens-vom-zeigertelegraf-zum-digitalisierer-337.html)-Standorten. Auch Privatwohnungen führender Manager des Konzerns blieben nicht unbehelligt. Sie finden Beweise für wenigstens 4.300 Schmiergeldzahlungen. Damit hatte sich der Elektronik- und Telekommunikationskonzern zwischen 1999 und 2006 Aufträge in Ägypten, Saudi-Arabien, Indonesien und Griechenland erkauft. Insgesamt 1,3 Milliarden Euro blätterten die Münchner dafür hin. Außerdem unterhielt der Dax-Konzern mit mehreren Hundert Millionen Euro gefüllte schwarze Kassen in Österreich, Liechtenstein und der Schweiz und machte sich so der Geldwäsche schuldig. Aufsichtsratchef Heinrich von Pierer und Vorstandsvorsitzender Klaus Kleinfeld müssen ihren Hut nehmen. Der Skandal kostet Siemens rund 2,9 Milliarden Euro an Strafen, Steuernachzahlungen und Anwaltskosten. ## Platz 4: Deutsche Bank - dienstbar für Geldwäsche im großen Stil Wenn es um Skandale geht, darf die Deutsche Bank nicht fehlen. Jahrelang drückte sie gern ein Auge zu, wenn es um verdächtige Geldflüsse ging und musste in den USA und Großbritannien deshalb diverse Strafen begleichen: 2017 zahlte sie 630 Millionen US-Dollar, weil sie verdächtigen Geldflüssen aus Russland nicht nachgegangen war. Zusätzlich kam im selben Jahr noch eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 41 Millionen US-Dollar dazu, weil sie Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche nicht eingehalten hatte. Dagegen ist die diesjährige Strafzahlung gar nicht so teuer: \"Nur\" 186 Millionen Dollar forderte die FED im Juli 2023 von der Bank - auch diesmal wegen ungenügender Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche. Es geht um die frühere Geschäftsbeziehung zur estnischen Tochter der Danske Bank. Die Danske Bank hatte in den Jahren 2008 bis 2016 diverse US-Banken betrogen und wurde in einem der größten US-Geldwäscheskandale zu einer Milliarden-Geldbuße verurteilt. Die Deutsche Bank wickelte verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von mehr als 267 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Danske Bank ab. #### Platz 3: Volkswagen-Dieselbetrug – Größter Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte In der Motorsteuerung von wenigstens elf Millionen Fahrzeugen verbaute Volkswagen bis 2015 illegale Abschalteinrichtungen. Damit ist „Dieselgate“ der größte Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte und ein schamloser Betrug an Kunden und Behörden. Verwickelt in die kriminellen Machenschaften sind fast alle Marken des Konzerns sowie der Zulieferer Bosch. Die Konzerntochter Audi soll bei der Entwicklung der verbotenen Software eine Vorreiterrolle gespielt haben. Der Dieselbetrug kostete den langjährigen [VW](https://www.produktion.de/rohstoffe/schrott/georgsmarienhuette-und-vw-recyceln-schrott-gemeinsam-617.html)-Chef Martin Winterkorn den Job. Ein Strafverfahren wegen möglicher Marktmanipulation gegen VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess und Aufsichtsratschef Hans Dieter Pötsch wurde gegen eine Zahlung von neun Millionen Euro eingestellt. Rupert Stadler wurde wegen Betrugs zu einer Bewährungsstrafe von einem Jahr und neun Monaten sowie einem Bußgeld von 1,1 Millionen Euro verurteilt. ## Platz 2: Wirecard - spektakulärster Bilanzskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte An der Geschäftspraxis und den Bilanzzahlen des deutschen Fintech-Hoffnungsträgers Wirecard kamen schon mehr als ein Jahrzehnt vor der Insolvenz Zweifel auf, aber die Firma schaffte es trotzdem in den Dax. Im Jahr 2019 deckt ein Bericht der britischen Zeitung \\'Financial Times\\' Unregelmäßigkeiten bei Geschäften in Singapur auf. Nach einigem Hin und Her kam 2020 der jähe Absturz des Unternehmens, als klar wurde, dass auf Treuhandkonten 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlen. CEO Markus Braun trat zurück und wurde festgenommen, während Vorstandsmitglied Jan Marsalek unter einem Vorwand das Land verließ und die Flucht ergriff. Am 25. Juni 2020 meldete der Dax-Konzern Insolvenz an. Es stellte sich heraus, dass wesentliche Teile des Geschäfts tatsächlich nie stattgefunden hatten. Der damalige Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz geriet unter Druck, weil die ihm unterstellte Bafin trotz aller Hinweise wenig gegen den Zahlungsdienstleister unternommen hatte. 2022 begann der Strafprozess gegen Markus Braun, Oliver Bellenhaus und den ehemaligen Wirecard-Chefbuchhalter. Sie sind angeklagt wegen Marktmanipulation, Untreue, falscher Darstellung und gewerbsmäßigen Bandenbetrugs. Marsalek wäre sicherlich mit auf der Anklagebank, ist aber bis heute flüchtig und wird mit internationalem Haftbefehl gesucht. Im Juli 2023 meldete er sich mit einem Brief beim Landgericht München, welcher Braun entlasten sollte. Zeugenaussagen zeichneten im Prozess das Bild eines Konzerns, in dem es chaotisch zuging und der Vorstand kein besonderes Interesse an der Rechtstreue zeigte. Auch die Firmenkultur ließ wohl zu wünschen übrig: \"Pornografie war ganz normal bei uns\", gab ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter der internen Revision im Zeugenstand zu Protokoll. Brauns Anwälte versuchten unterdessen mit 450 Beweisanträgen zu belegen, dass Marsalek und Kronzeuge Bellenhaus sowie zahlreiche Mittäter die Schuld tragen, während Braun ahnungslos war. Ob sie das Gericht überzeugen können? Aktuell zeichnet sich erstmal eine Verlängerung der Verhandlung ab. Für diesen filmreifen Skandal gibt es hier im Ranking Platz 2. #### Platz 1: Cum-Ex-Skandal – Größter Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Die kriminelle Energie deutscher Banken und ihrer Anleger kennt keine Grenzen. Mit „Cum-Ex“- und „Cum-Cum“-Wertpapiertransaktionen zwischen mehreren Anlegern rundum den Dividendenstichtag einer Aktie verwirrten die Kreditinstitute von 2005 bis 2011 gezielt den Fiskus. So sehr, dass Finanzbeamte am Schluss nicht mehr erkennen konnten, welcher Bankkunde auf die Ausschüttung Kapitalertragsteuer gezahlt hatte, und welcher nicht. So konnten sich auch Anleger die Steuer zurückerstatten lassen, die sie gar nicht bezahlt hatten. Insgesamt prellten Banken und Aktionäre den deutschen Steuerzahler so um bis zu 32 Milliarden Euro – der größte Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik. *Überarbeitet von Julia Dusold und Dagmar Merger (14.08.2023)* ## Sie möchten gerne weiterlesen? ### Jetzt kostenlos registrieren oder einloggen: Newsletter-Anmeldung Bleiben Sie zu allen Themen, Trends und Innovationen der Branche informiert. ## Auch interessant ## Aktuelle Beiträge [Wirtschaft](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft.html) 15.

The investigation focuses on the bank’s handling of high-risk transactions, including correspondent banking relationships and the adequacy of its know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Key risk indicators cited include insufficient verification of beneficial ownership, inadequate screening of politically exposed persons (PEPs), and lapses in transaction monitoring that may have allowed suspicious activity reports (SARs) to go unfiled or delayed.\\n\\nRegulators have emphasized the seriousness of unresolved compliance deficiencies, with Danske Bank facing potential consent orders or settlements as part of enforcement actions. The bank’s responsiveness to these probes and the severity of any penalties imposed will significantly impact its risk profile. Past enforcement precedents in the sector suggest that failure to remediate AML/KYC gaps can lead to substantial fines and operational restrictions, underscoring the critical importance of robust sanctions compliance and real-time transaction oversight.\\n\\nAs Danske Bank navigates the regulatory landscape shaped by this money laundering inquiry, the institution’s ability to strengthen its AML controls and remediate identified weaknesses remains pivotal. The outcome of these enforcement actions will be closely watched as indicators of the bank’s commitment to regulatory compliance and risk mitigation in the evolving financial sector.',\n",

Transaction monitoring data reveals a series of unusual counterparties and complex cash-flow patterns that suggest efforts to obscure beneficial ownership and circumvent standard know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. These patterns include rapid movement of funds through multiple jurisdictions and the use of politically exposed persons (PEPs) to mask illicit origins, raising red flags in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance reviews.\\n\\nTypical AML processes at Danske Bank involve stringent KYC checks, ongoing transaction monitoring, and the filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs) when anomalies are detected. However, forensic transaction analysis identifies layering techniques characterized by multiple, seemingly unrelated transfers designed to disrupt audit trails. The involvement of high-risk jurisdictions and shell entities as counterparties further complicates the detection of illicit flows. These indicators often trigger enhanced due diligence measures, yet the persistence of unusual cash flows points to potential gaps in enforcement or evasion tactics within Danske Bank’s AML framework.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have reportedly initiated probes into Danske Bank’s compliance with AML regulations, focusing on the adequacy of its transaction monitoring systems and the effectiveness of sanctions screening. Discussions of possible consent orders and settlement agreements have emerged, reflecting ongoing efforts to address identified vulnerabilities. Allegations include insufficient oversight of correspondent banking relationships and failure to timely report suspicious activities, which could result in significant fines and mandated remedial actions.\\n\\nDanske Bank remains at the center of concerns regarding its exposure to money laundering risks through complex transactional layering and questionable counterparties, underscoring the critical importance of robust AML controls and vigilant enforcement in the banking sector.',\n",

The bank’s governance structures and risk management frameworks have been questioned in light of alleged lapses that potentially enabled money laundering activities involving high-risk jurisdictions.\\n\\nKey AML and know-your-customer (KYC) processes such as enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs), beneficial ownership verification, and transaction monitoring appear to have suffered from inconsistent application and oversight. Suspicious activity reports (SARs) were reportedly delayed or inadequately filed, while controls over cross-border correspondent banking transactions lacked sufficient granularity to detect complex layering schemes. Furthermore, sanctions screening protocols and ongoing customer risk assessments did not consistently align with regulatory expectations, exposing Danske Bank to elevated compliance risks.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have initiated a probe into Danske Bank’s internal governance and control environment, focusing on whether systemic control breakdowns contributed to the facilitation of illicit funds. The bank is reportedly engaged in discussions regarding a potential consent order or settlement to address identified deficiencies. Enforcement agencies are emphasizing the need for robust remedial measures, including strengthened third-party oversight and enhanced transaction surveillance capabilities, to mitigate future operational risks.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s case underscores the critical importance of rigorous internal controls and governance mechanisms in preventing money laundering, highlighting how control failures and procedural gaps can undermine AML efforts within complex banking operations.',\n",

The bank’s operations in correspondent banking and cross-border transactions have come under particular focus, raising questions about the adequacy of its internal controls and compliance frameworks within a complex jurisdictional landscape.\\n\\nCentral to the controversy are Danske Bank’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, which reportedly failed to detect or prevent suspicious activity reports (SARs) involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) and entities with opaque beneficial ownership structures. Weaknesses in transaction monitoring and gaps in sanctions screening contributed to the prolonged exposure to illicit funds, underscoring systemic vulnerabilities in the bank’s risk management. The bank’s consent order and subsequent efforts to strengthen internal controls reflect an acknowledgment of these deficiencies, though media sentiment analysis suggests persistent skepticism about the effectiveness of remedial measures.\\n\\nRegulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions have led to high-profile investigations and discussions of potential settlements involving substantial fines. Danske Bank has faced allegations of inadequate oversight and failure to comply with AML regulations, prompting enforcement agencies to intensify their focus on the institution’s compliance culture.

Authorities overseeing anti-money laundering enforcement have reportedly engaged in a consent order process, with potential settlement discussions addressing the bank’s lapses in KYC controls and AML program effectiveness. While exact penalties remain undisclosed, the investigation underscores systemic weaknesses in Danske Bank’s ability to maintain robust beneficial ownership verification and to file timely suspicious activity reports.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s case illustrates the critical importance of rigorous KYC and beneficial ownership transparency in preventing money laundering risks, emphasizing the need for intensified screening and transaction monitoring to uphold AML standards in the global banking sector.',\n",

The bank’s extensive correspondent relationships across multiple jurisdictions may challenge its ability to maintain robust know-your-customer (KYC) standards and effective transaction monitoring. Typical red flags in this context include complex beneficial ownership structures, politically exposed persons (PEPs) involvement, unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with customer profiles, and dealings with sanctioned entities or regions. These risk indicators require heightened due diligence and prompt suspicious activity reports (SARs) to regulators.\\n\\nRegulatory probes into Danske Bank’s AML framework could focus on whether the institution has adequately identified and mitigated risks inherent in its correspondent banking channels.

The bank’s correspondent banking services have reportedly been exploited to facilitate illicit funds transfers, raising questions about the robustness of its internal controls within the banking sector.\\n\\nCentral to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance are rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, including thorough verification of beneficial ownership and enhanced due diligence for politically exposed persons (PEPs). Danske Bank’s transaction monitoring systems are expected to generate suspicious activity reports (SARs) when detecting anomalies or patterns indicative of money laundering. However, lapses in these processes—such as insufficient identification of high-risk clients or failure to flag complex cross-border transactions—may have contributed to regulatory concerns. The bank’s adherence to sanctions screening and ongoing customer consent orders also form critical components of its risk mitigation framework.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have initiated probes into Danske Bank’s AML controls, focusing on whether the institution adequately fulfilled its compliance obligations or whether systemic weaknesses allowed illicit activities to persist.

Indicators like rapid movement of funds through trade invoices, inconsistent documentation, and frequent changes in account ownership signal potential trade-based money laundering. Additionally, exploitation of shell companies with unclear economic purpose complicates the bank’s ability to file timely and effective suspicious activity reports (SARs).\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have hypothetically initiated probes into Danske Bank’s compliance frameworks, focusing on gaps in sanctions screening and KYC verification.

The bank’s challenges appear rooted in weaknesses surrounding the oversight of third-party service providers, whose insufficient compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols may have facilitated illicit financial flows across multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\nCentral to Danske Bank’s AML framework are processes such as enhanced due diligence on beneficial ownership, politically exposed persons (PEP) screening, sanctions checks, and ongoing transaction monitoring. However, the involvement of external vendors in customer onboarding and suspicious activity reporting (SARs) has raised concerns about inconsistent application of these controls. Risk indicators including unusual transaction patterns, high-risk jurisdictions, and complex ownership structures were reportedly not adequately flagged or escalated, partially due to gaps in vendor management and insufficient real-time monitoring capabilities.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have launched probes into Danske Bank’s compliance failures, focusing on the bank’s reliance on third parties for critical AML functions.

      "- $50 million (2025-10-08) ≈ €46.25 million\n",

      "\n",
      "**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Nature:** Systemic money laundering through Estonian branch (2007–2015), with €200+ billion in suspicious transactions, mainly from Russian clients.\n",
      "- **Criminal Conviction:** Admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud (2024-07-11).\n",
      "- **Regulatory Failures:** Inadequate AML controls, poor client due diligence, and failure to act on warnings (e.g., from Central Bank of Russia in 2013).\n",
      "- **Leadership Accountability:** CEO and key executives resigned; Estonian branch closed in 2019.\n",
      "- **Jurisdictions:** Denmark, Estonia, US, UK, France, and broader EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. CURRENT STATUS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Resolved:** Major settlements with US, Danish, and French authorities; Estonian branch closed; executive resignations.\n",
      "- **Ongoing:** Investigations by Danish, Estonian, US, and UK authorities (as of 2025-06-20); recent fines (2025-08-29, 2025-10-08) indicate continued regulatory scrutiny.\n",
      "- **Geographic Spread:** Multi-jurisdictional (EU, US, Russia, Baltics).\n",
      "- **Recent Activity:** Fines and settlements as recent as October 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. TRAJECTORY**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pattern:** Repeated, large-scale violations over many years; fines and settlements continue into 2025.\n",
      "- **Improvement:** Some evidence of reform (branch closure, leadership change, settlements), but ongoing investigations and recent fines suggest risk remains elevated.\n",
      "- **Quote:** \"Danske Bank was fined over $2 billion by US authorities in 2022 as a result of an investigation into its Estonian branch's involvement in processing suspicious transactions for high-risk clients through the US financial system.\" (2025-06-20)\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. RISK RATING**\n",
      "\n",
      "**HIGH**  \n",
      "- Justification: Systemic, multi-year, multi-jurisdictional AML failures; total fines exceed €2 billion; ongoing investigations; recent fines; criminal conviction; pattern of repeated violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. PARTNERSHIP RECOMMENDATION**\n",
      "\n",
      "**AVOID PARTNERSHIP**  \n",
      "- Rationale: Ongoing criminal and regulatory investigations, unresolved risk, and a pattern of systemic AML failures with recent enforcement actions. The scale and recency of violations, combined with the magnitude of fines and multi-jurisdictional scrutiny, indicate that Danske Bank remains a high-risk partner for AML compliance.\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\\n\\nDanske Bank has been implicated in one of the largest money laundering scandals in European history, with over €200 billion in suspicious funds processed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The bank has admitted guilt, faced criminal convictions, and paid fines totaling over €2.5 billion across multiple jurisdictions, including the US, Denmark, France, and Estonia. The violations were systemic, spanning nearly a decade, and involved failures in AML controls, client due diligence, and transaction monitoring. While major settlements have been reached and executive resignations have occurred, ongoing investigations and recent fines indicate that the risk is not fully resolved.\\n\\n**Total Fines Paid Calculation:**\\n- €470 million (2024-11-18)\\n- $2 million (2025-08-29) ≈ €1.85 million (at $1 = €0.925)\\n- Over $2 billion (2025-06-20) ≈ €1.85 billion\\n- €6,028,799 + €300,000 = €6.33 million (2025-05-27)\\n- $50 million (2025-10-08) ≈ €46.25 million\\n- €6.3 million (2024-09-18) [French settlement]\\n- Additional fines referenced but not quantified (hundreds of millions, billion-dollar fine, etc.)\\n\\n**Total (rounded, using largest confirmed numbers and avoiding double-counting):**\\n- €470 million + €1.85 billion + €6.33 million + €1.85 million + €46.25 million + €6.3 million = **€2,380,730,000** (approx. €2.38 billion)\\n\\n**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\\n\\n- **Nature:** Systemic money laundering through Estonian branch (2007–2015), with €200+ billion in suspicious transactions, mainly from Russian clients.\\n- **Criminal Conviction:** Admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud (2024-07-11).\\n- **Regulatory Failures:** Inadequate AML controls, poor client due diligence, and failure to act on warnings (e.g., from Central Bank of Russia in 2013).\\n- **Leadership Accountability:** CEO and key executives resigned; Estonian branch closed in 2019.\\n- **Jurisdictions:** Denmark, Estonia, US, UK, France, and broader EU.\\n\\n**3. CURRENT STATUS**\\n\\n- **Resolved:** Major settlements with US, Danish, and French authorities; Estonian branch closed; executive resignations.\\n- **Ongoing:** Investigations by Danish, Estonian, US, and UK authorities (as of 2025-06-20); recent fines (2025-08-29, 2025-10-08) indicate continued regulatory scrutiny.\\n- **Geographic Spread:** Multi-jurisdictional (EU, US, Russia, Baltics).\\n- **Recent Activity:** Fines and settlements as recent as October 2025.\\n\\n**4. TRAJECTORY**\\n\\n- **Pattern:** Repeated, large-scale violations over many years; fines and settlements continue into 2025.\\n- **Improvement:** Some evidence of reform (branch closure, leadership change, settlements), but ongoing investigations and recent fines suggest risk remains elevated.\\n- **Quote:** \"Danske Bank was fined over $2 billion by US authorities in 2022 as a result of an investigation into its Estonian branch\\'s involvement in processing suspicious transactions for high-risk clients through the US financial system.\" (2025-06-20)\\n\\n**5. RISK RATING**\\n\\n**HIGH**  \\n- Justification: Systemic, multi-year, multi-jurisdictional AML failures; total fines exceed €2 billion; ongoing investigations; recent fines; criminal conviction; pattern of repeated violations.\\n\\n**6. PARTNERSHIP RECOMMENDATION**\\n\\n**AVOID PARTNERSHIP**  \\n- Rationale: Ongoing criminal and regulatory investigations, unresolved risk, and a pattern of systemic AML failures with recent enforcement actions. The scale and recency of violations, combined with the magnitude of fines and multi-jurisdictional scrutiny, indicate that Danske Bank remains a high-risk partner for AML compliance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary Table**\\n\\n| Criteria                | Status/Details                                                                 |\\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Total Fines Paid        | Approx. €2.38 billion (multi-jurisdictional, 2018–2025)                       |\\n| Most Serious Issue      | Systemic laundering of €200+ billion via Estonian branch (2007–2015)           |\\n| Ongoing Risk?           | Yes (as of 2025-10-08; multiple active investigations)                         |\\n| Investigating Authority | US DOJ, SEC, Danish FSA, French PNF, Estonian, UK authorities                  |\\n| Geographic Spread       | Denmark, Estonia, US, UK, France, Baltics, Russia                              |\\n| Settlement Efforts      | Major settlements, executive resignations, branch closure, but risk persists   |\\n| Risk Rating             | HIGH                                                                           |\\n| Recommendation          | AVOID PARTNERSHIP                                                              |', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1059, 'prompt_tokens': 2182, 'total_tokens': 3241, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d38c7f4fa7', 'id': 'chatcmpl-Ca2l4fI5vEOepLpMYPRjN9ccQivnA', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--1e310131-faf7-479f-bde5-8240504e3fab-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2182, 'output_tokens': 1059, 'total_tokens': 3241, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})],\n",

[Lucinity](/blog/author/lucinity) 5 min With illicit financial flows becoming increasingly complex, combating money laundering is a major challenge for the financial sector. [Global estimates suggest that 2-5% of the world\\'s GDP is laundered annually](https://www.europol.europa.eu/crime-areas/economic-crime/money-laundering?ref=lucinity.ghost.io), shedding light on the severe need for more effective compliance solutions. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in, fundamentally changing how businesses tackle anti-money laundering (AML) compliance problems. This blog covers AI\\'s indispensable role in enhancing AML compliance, showcasing its potential to significantly improve detection and operational efficiency, thus offering a robust defense against financial crimes. ## **Importance of Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is essential to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the financial system. [Effective AML practices prevent the financial market from becoming a playground for illicit activities](https://lucinity.com/blog/the-framl-model?ref=lucinity.ghost.io), such as drug trafficking, terrorism financing, and other serious crimes. Enforcing robust AML measures allows financial institutions to comply with legal mandates. Additionally, it helps safeguard their reputation, sustain customer trust, and plays a significant role in maintaining global economic stability. The urgency for stringent [anti-money laundering](https://lucinity.com/blog/fintech-anti-money-laundering-tips?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) compliance has escalated as financial systems become more interconnected globally, providing greater opportunities for sophisticated criminal networks to exploit vulnerabilities. The laundering of money poses a severe threat to the financial world, influencing everything from market volatility to international relations. Strengthening anti-money laundering compliance helps counter this threat by safeguarding the financial sector against various risks. It also contributes to establishing a secure and stable economic environment worldwide. However, money laundering techniques continue to adapt and grow, and AML regulations are getting increasingly complicated in response. This creates multiple compliance challenges for businesses. ## **Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Challenges** [AML compliance](https://lucinity.com/blog/aml-compliance-what-you-should-know?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) challenges are a major concern for financial institutions, as they face several obstacles in maintaining a robust anti-money laundering program. Here are some common AML compliance hurdles- * **Data Volume and Complexity**- The sheer amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed for AML purposes can be overwhelming. Traditional tools, often manual and data-intensive, lack the efficiency and effectiveness to cope with the intricacies of modern financial crimes. * **Evolving Criminal Tactics**- Money launderers continually adapt, using sophisticated methods to evade detection. This necessitates a dynamic and equally sophisticated response from AML systems, a task that often overwhelms conventional compliance mechanisms. * **Integration with Legacy Systems**- [Many financial institutions operate on legacy systems that are not readily compatible with advanced AI solutions.](https://lucinity.com/blog/saas-vs-legacy?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) This brings us to the challenge of integrating new technologies without disrupting existing operations. * **False Positives**- Striking the right balance to reduce false positives without missing genuine suspicious activities is a major challenge in AML compliance programs, especially while using traditional systems. These AML compliance challenges are ubiquitous, and there’s a pressing need for innovative solutions capable of addressing these multifaceted issues. This is where AI is instrumental. Let’s learn about advanced AML compliance solutions and how they leverage AI to help you handle these challenges and ensure efficient AML compliance. ## **The Role of AI in Anti-money Laundering Compliance** Here’s how [Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing anti-money laundering compliance solutions](https://lucinity.com/blog/from-solo-to-copilot?ref=lucinity.ghost.io) to directly address AML challenges and apply best practices proactively- * **Advanced Detection and Analysis**- AI algorithms excel at sifting through vast datasets quickly, identifying suspicious patterns that might elude human analysts. The advanced suspicious transaction detection and analysis of AI algorithms help pinpoint potential money laundering activities hidden within complex financial transactions with ease. * **Predictive Analytics**- AI\\'s predictive capabilities allow financial institutions to foresee and mitigate potential AML risks before they escalate. By analyzing historical data and current trends, AI can forecast future money laundering schemes, enabling proactive rather than reactive measures. * **Operational Efficiency**- AI streamlines AML processes by automating routine tasks like data collection, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity report generation. Speeding up the compliance process, AI also frees up valuable resources to focus on more strategic, high-level analysis. * **Reducing False Positives**- A major benefit of integrating AI in anti-money laundering compliance is its ability to minimize false positives, which are costly and time-consuming. AI\\'s precision in differentiating between legitimate and suspicious activities helps fine-tune the alert system, ensuring that compliance teams concentrate on genuine threats. * **Continuous Improvement and Learning**- AI systems, particularly those employing machine learning, evolve and improve over time. They adapt to new money laundering tactics, ensuring that AML policies and procedures remain effective against the constantly evolving threats. * **Integration and Scalability**- AI can be integrated with existing systems, enhancing their capabilities without necessitating a complete overhaul. Its scalability means that it can handle increasing volumes of transactions and data, which is essential for growing financial institutions. With these advantages, AI fortifies the anti-money laundering compliance framework and also ensures it is adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. ## **Case Studies: AI in Action for AML** We will now consider real-life examples to better interpret the practical application of AI in enhancing Anti-Money Laundering compliance: * [**Danske Bank**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/achieving-real-business/9781492038214/ch06.html?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- Facing challenges with its existing AML processes, Danske Bank adopted an AI-powered system that analyzed customer data and transaction patterns in real time. This shift resulted in a 60% reduction in false positives, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of its AML program. * [**HSBC**](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/hsbc-deploys-industry-first-automated-aml-system/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- By implementing an AI-driven system for AML, HSBC managed to automate its compliance processes, leading to a more streamlined operation and effective customer due diligence. The technology helped the bank reduce the time spent on AML reviews and save approximately $400,000 annually, demonstrating considerable cost-effectiveness. * [**Standard Chartered**](https://loopline.org.uk/navigating-card-fees-in-retail-a-guide-to-interchange-fees-and-maximising-savings/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- This bank implemented AI to automate its AML processes, analyzing data and transaction patterns effectively. The result was a 40% reduction in compliance review time, showcasing the efficiency gains achievable with AI integration. * [**JPMorgan Chase**](https://www.thestack.technology/transaction-monitoring-banking/?ref=lucinity.ghost.io)- In an effort to enhance its AML initiatives, JPMorgan Chase implemented AI and achieved a remarkable 95% reduction in false positives. This improvement in the program\\'s accuracy highlighted the significant potential of AI to drive advancements in AML compliance solutions. ## **Lucinity\\'s Innovation in AML Compliance through AI** Lucinity seamlessly incorporates AI into AML compliance solutions, providing innovative and robust answers to the financial sector\\'s challenges.

However, it can also be exploited by criminals for severe crimes like human trafficking and terrorism. Danske Bank is dedicated to fighting financial crime and we have completed a groupwide financial crime enhancement programme, investing in systems and controls to protect the bank and its customers. Continuing to develop and improve our efforts to preserve the integrity of our business and uphold our societal responsibility is a key priority for us. ## How we fight financial crime ### We adhere to Finance Denmark\\'s principles At Danske Bank, we adhere to the principles developed by Finance Denmark’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Taskforce in which we participated, to prevent and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. These principles are reflected in our approach. * #### We always prioritise ethics over profit * #### We comply with the spirit and the letter of the law * #### We welcome oversight * #### We have a targeted corporate culture commitment * #### We assume managerial responsibility and ensure that all staff take responsibility for AML/CTF efforts * #### We have constructive partnerships with all stakeholders, including the authorities ### We focus on people, partnerships and processes * ### ### We ensure that we have the right PEOPLE and competencies in place to fight financial crime. ### Key initiatives + #### Fighting financial crime is a top priority We have governance structures in place to ensure escalation of compliance matters when required. Our Chief Compliance Officer is a member of our Executive Leadership Team, ensuring that compliance and the fight against financial crime is an integrated part of how we do business. Financial crime prevention is part of our organisational DNA and we nurture a shared mind-set, where employees are mindful of doing the right kind of business with the right customers in the right way. + #### Mandatory fighting financial crime training All employees are required to complete mandatory training in fighting financial crime every year. We also provide targeted financial crime prevention training to employees throughout the organisation, ranging from senior management to frontline advisors. This specialised training considers different learning objectives that are specific to certain roles and includes feedback loops to ensure that we are learning from the past. + #### An essential part of our business We have experienced financial crime prevention specialists in our organisation, and we maintain strong competencies across our three lines of defence. * ### ### We engage proactively with authorities and industry colleagues in PARTNERSHIPS to fight financial crime together. **### Key initiatives** + #### Supporting a stronger industry framework Danske Bank contributes expertise and policy recommendations to create a more efficient and effective industry framework for preventing money laundering and countering terrorist financing. + #### Participation in public-private partnerships Danske Bank actively engages in initiatives to collectively fight financial crime by increasing cooperation between the financial sector and authorities. The collaboration facilitates the detection of criminal methods, criminal individuals and criminal networks. Furthermore, the public-private partnerships enable more and better collaboration and greater knowledge sharing among all participants and parties involved in societal initiatives against money laundering and terrorist financing. Some examples of this work are our participation in the Operational Danish Intelligence Network (ODIN), the Swedish Anti Money Laundering Initiative (SAMLIT) and the Finnish Anti Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FAMLIT). + #### Joint efforts against cybercrime Danske Bank collaborates with external cyber security organisations to help strengthen cyber resilience in the Nordic countries. In addition, we also provide advice and tools for our customers that enable them to protect themselves against cyber criminals and payment fraud, such as investment scams, romance scams, crypto-currency scams, and ID theft. To raise awareness of fraud trends, we also collaborate with the Danish Consumer Council on their free self-defence app, [Mit digitale forsvar](https://taenk.dk/om-os/apps-fra-forbrugerraadet-taenk/app-mit-digitale-selvforsvar) * ### ### We continually develop our PROCESSES, controls, and systems to maintain our ability to effectively prevent financial crimes. ### Key initiatives + #### Customer on-boarding and data quality As a bank, we are required by law to review our customers to better understand who they are, why they want to become customers of Danske Bank, and how they intend to use our services. We use digital platforms and tools to optimise our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data collection and ensure the quality of existing KYC data, allowing us to validate the data quickly and making it easy to become a customer of Danske Bank. + #### International money transfers We require complete information about the payer and recipient of international payments. This means that several items of information about the payer and recipient must follow the transaction throughout the payment process. The purpose of these requirements is to prevent, investigate and trace money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to ensure that international payments are secure. + #### Transaction monitoring systems Monitoring and screening of customers and their transactions are a vital part of Danske Bank\\'s financial crime defence. We undertake automated monitoring and surveillance of transactions and communications by utilising technologies to optimise the process and target relevant risks, and we continue to ensure that our systems are fit to identify potentially unusual patterns. + #### Investigation and reporting At Danske Bank, we pursue investigation efficiency and effectiveness to ensure that any suspicion of financial crime is reported to the relevant authorities for further investigation. We continue to ensure that the speed and coverage of our investigations are fit to identify potential financial crime risks. We use data analytics and visualisation systems to provide both our management and relevant authorities with higher quality suspicious activity reports. + #### Complying with financial sanctions Danske Bank complies with all legally applicable financial sanctions, including sanctions imposed by the UN, the EU and jurisdictions in which Danske Bank operates, including the UK. In addition, Danske Bank complies with US sanctions to the required extent due to the extraterritorial nature of those sanctions and for overall risk management reasons. At Danske Bank, we have processes in place to ensure that we do not offer banking services to sanctioned parties and that we do not engage in transactions or activities in violation of sanctions. Due to the overall financial crime risk associated with a specific country, area or sector, Danske Bank’s policy towards specific countries, areas, sectors, etc. may be more restrictive than applicable financial sanctions. We generally do not facilitate any business or transactions involving North Korea, Iran, Syria and the territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea and any other territory not under the control of the Ukrainian government. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have implemented a restrictive approach to any new business or activities involving Russia or Belarus. We also maintain a limited financial crime risk position for activities involving Cuba. We may consider processing specific transactions involving these territories, such as transactions related to humanitarian aid, if we receive a request from our customer in advance. We may, in our sole discretion, decide not to process transactions or provide certain products or services or decide to otherwise decline to facilitate transactions in cases where these activities fall outside Danske Bank’s risk appetite. ### Our Three-Lines-of-Defence ensures effective governance The-Three-Lines-of-Defence-Model is a key element in ensuring effective governance and oversight of financial crime risk - including ensuring that clearly defined roles and responsibilities are in place. **The 1st Line of Defence** owns and manages business activities and related risks. Includes business units and Group functions (e.g. operations, HR and finance). **The 2nd Line of Defence**provides risk management framework and performs risk oversight. Supports and challenges the 1st Line of Defence. Includes Group Compliance and Group Risk Management. **The 3rd Line of Defence** is an independent and objective unit (Internal Audit) evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes in relation to the control environments of the 1st and 2nd Lines of Defence. ## How this affects customers Preventing and fighting financial crime are two essential tasks that every responsible financial institution must perform. That is why we at Danske Bank have both an obligation and a commitment to comply with Danish and international anti-money laundering legislation and regulations and to fight money laundering and fraud against banks and customers. Among other things, this means that we continuously update our knowledge of our customers and their use of our products and services, carefully monitor transactions and cooperate closely with authorities in and outside Denmark We understand that customers can feel a little inconvenienced or even irritated when we ask for information and a copy of their proof of identity. However, just as the security check at the airport ensures that all travellers can enjoy a safe journey, it is both necessary and in the interest of us all. fd64f5f5-00090258-dd6cc6eb ## Financial crime policy and whistleblowing scheme ### Financial crime policy Our group-wide financial crime policy is a crucial part of our overall [Compliance Framework](/about-us/corporate-governance/compliance).

Lenahan-Pfahlert](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/l/lenahan-pfahlert-kelly) on September 4, 2024 Posted in [Civil Penalty](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/civil-penalty/), [Compliance Program](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/compliance-program/), [Correspondent Bank Accounts](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/correspondent-bank-accounts/), [Customer Due Diligence](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/customer-due-diligence/), [New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/new-york-department-of-financial-services/), [Panama Papers](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/panama-papers/), [Transaction Monitoring](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/transaction-monitoring/) ![Image 2](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/09/AdobeStock_56312148-656x437.jpeg) On August 27, 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) [announced](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20240827) a [consent order](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/08/ea20240827-co-nordea.pdf) involving a $35 million settlement with Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) for alleged significant failures related to anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance. Nordea, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, operates globally, including through a licensed branch in New York, [which has its own AML and transaction monitoring requirements](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2017/01/2016-year-in-review-nydfs-finalizes-broad-aml-regulations/). The enforcement action, which followed revelations from the [Panama Papers leak](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/12/first-u-s-indictment-relating-to-panama-papers-charges-lawyer-asset-manager-accountant-and-client/), found that Nordea allegedly failed to conduct proper due diligence on high-risk correspondent banking relationships and maintained inadequate AML controls. According to the NYDFS, the Panama Papers implicated Nordea in aiding clients in establishing offshore shell companies in order to facilitate illicit activities. The consent order alleges that Nordea violated New York law by allowing compliance failures in its AML program and procedures to persist. Meanwhile, [Danish officials recently charged Nordea](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/denmark-takes-nordea-court-possible-breaches-anti-money-laundering-act-2024-07-05/) with repeatedly violating Denmark’s anti-money laundering act between 2012 and 2015, thereby exposing Nordea, potentially, [to extremely significant fines](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/11/nordea-risks-money-laundering-fine-near-1-billion-experts-say/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Nordea%20Bank%20could,exceed%20the%20lender%27s%20own%20expectations.). As we will discuss, although the consent order implicates many different issues, the NYDFS enforcement action represents, in part, the latest chapter in the continued fall-out from the [massive AML scandal involving Dankse Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2023/01/sdny-sentences-danske-bank-in-massive-aml-scandal/). The consent order also highlights, once again, the particular risks posed by correspondent banking relationships, on which we repeatedly have blogged (for example, [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2021/03/amla-expands-doj-grand-jury-subpoena-power-over-correspondent-bank-accounts-and-foreign-banks/), [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/10/fincen-solicits-commentary-on-due-diligence-for-correspondent-and-private-bank-accounts/), and [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/06/28-north-korean-and-5-chinese-bankers-accused-of-a-2-5-billion-laundering-scheme/)). ### _Key Takeaways_ The Consent Order reflects that the NYDFS made the following findings: 1. **Deficient AML Program**: Nordea’s AML program, particularly within its Baltic branches (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and the International Branch in Denmark, exhibited significant deficiencies. These included insufficient policies and procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious activities, exposing the bank to heightened risks of money laundering. 2. **Inadequate Due Diligence**: Nordea failed to conduct adequate due diligence on its correspondent banking relationships. Failure to properly assess the risks associated with the banking parties may have facilitated money laundering. 3. **Insufficient Transaction Monitoring**: Nordea’s transaction monitoring system was inadequate, further exacerbating the risks associated with its AML compliance failures. 4. **High-Risk Transactions**: The NYDFS linked Nordea’s Baltic operations to billions of dollars in high-risk transactions. These transactions underscored the vulnerabilities in the bank’s control mechanisms. 5. **Prior Regulatory Warnings**: Regulatory bodies in Nordic countries previously identified weaknesses in Nordea’s AML compliance programs. Despite these warnings, the bank did not take adequate measures to address the identified issues, allowing the risks to persist. ### _Challenges in the Baltic Branches_ According to NYDFS, Nordea’s Baltic branches faced significant challenges in managing money laundering risks, particularly concerning customers from post-Soviet states with high corruption indices. Despite recognizing these risks, the bank’s efforts to enhance its AML compliance between 2010 and 2017 were insufficient. Audits conducted during this period revealed an overreliance on manual monitoring, inadequate customer identification data, and persistent shortcomings in Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) and Enhanced Due Diligence (“EDD”) processes. These issues left the bank vulnerable to financial crimes. ### _Issues at the International Branch at Vesterport_ Nordea’s International Branch in Vesterport, Denmark (“VIB”), which primarily served corporate customers with connections to Russia and Eastern Europe, was implicated in numerous money laundering scandals, including the Panama Papers, [Russian Laundromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Laundromat), and [Azerbaijani Laundromat](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat). Audits conducted in 2009 and 2013 allegedly identified significant gaps in CDD, EDD, and transaction monitoring processes. These deficiencies, coupled with media scrutiny and increased inquiries from correspondent banks, ultimately led to the branch’s closure in 2014. ### _Nordea’s Correspondent Banking and RMA Relationships_ Nordea maintained extensive correspondent banking relationships and exchanged SWIFT Relationship Management Application (“RMA”) keys with various financial institutions, including Danske Bank, ABLV, and Bank of Cyprus. The NYDFS found that Nordea failed to adequately manage and monitor the risks associated with these relationships. **Danske Bank** [Danske Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2019/03/massive-danske-bank-money-laundering-scandal-continues-to-unfold/), headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, had a significant correspondent banking relationship with Nordea, with substantial annual cross-border payment traffic. Despite adverse findings from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in 2012 and other issues, Nordea assigned Danske an AML risk class “A” rating in 2013. However, internal reviews in 2016 and 2017 identified significant compliance failures, necessitating a downgrade in Danske’s AML risk rating and increased monitoring. **ABLV** ABLV Bank, based in Latvia, [was identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) in 2018 as a primary money laundering concern](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/02/fincen-imposes-section-311-fifth-special-measure-on-latvian-bank-ablv/). Despite identifying numerous red flags, Nordea delayed terminating its relationship with ABLV until after FinCEN’s notice. NYDFS determined that this delay exposed Nordea to significant risks and highlighted the need for more timely and effective AML compliance measures. **Bank of Cyprus** The Bank of Cyprus, known for its associations with Russia, allegedly posed substantial money laundering risks. Despite identifying high risks and red flags, NYDFS found that Nordea maintained its relationship with the bank until 2019. Internal audits and KYC reviews allegedly revealed gaps in Nordea’s due diligence regarding the Bank of Cyprus. In 2015, Nordea’s internal audit revealed deficiencies in KYC procedures, including insufficient Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) screening, and lack of site visits at the Bank of Cyprus. The KYC file from that year flagged additional risks, including Cyprus’s status as an offshore financial center and ineffective financial oversight. Notably, the file identified three PEPs on the board of Bank of Cyprus, including a former KGB agent and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. It was not until 2023 that Nordea had fully exited its association with the Bank of Cyprus, closing all RMAs except those required by prior guarantees. ### _Transaction Monitoring_ In 2008, Nordea implemented an IT-supported transaction monitoring system, fully operational by 2010. Initially, the system included three monitoring scenarios, expanding to six by 2013, but did not cover correspondent banking transactions. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority identified these deficiencies in 2015, prompting Nordea to introduce 28 new monitoring scenarios in 2016, specifically for correspondent banking risks. Despite these enhancements, Nordea Bank Finland faced challenges integrating transaction data into the automated system, leading to the development of semi-automated controls by mid-2018. Additionally, Nordea allegedly failed to prevent transactions involving ABLV due to delays in updating internal sanctions lists, resulting in breaches of internal sanctions standards. Between 2016 and 2018, flagged transactions related to the Bank of Cyprus were not addressed, and the relationship continued until 2019. NYDFS acknowledged Nordea’s efforts to improve transaction monitoring but noted ongoing significant challenges and areas requiring improvement. ### _The Consent Order_ As part of the settlement, Nordea agreed to several measures to address the deficiencies identified by the NYDFS in addition to the $35 million monetary penalty. These measures include: 1. **Strengthening the AML Compliance Program**: Nordea committed to enhancing its AML policies, procedures, and controls to better detect and prevent money laundering activities. 2. **Enhancing Transaction Monitoring**: The bank agreed to upgrade its transaction monitoring system to more effectively identify and report suspicious activities. 3. **Rigorous Due Diligence on Correspondent Banking Relationships**: Nordea will conduct more thorough due diligence on its correspondent banking partners to ensure compliance with AML standards. 4. **Independent Compliance Review**: An independent consultant will be appointed to assess Nordea’s compliance with the Consent Order, providing recommendations for further improvements and ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon measures. 5. **Regular Progress Reports**: Nordea is required to submit periodic progress reports to the NYDFS, detailing the steps taken to comply with the Consent Order and the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

Für Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, die Feinheiten zu verstehen. ### Definition und Grundlagen der Geldwäsche Geldwäsche ist der Prozess, bei dem illegal erzielte Erlöse als legal erscheinen. Es ist eine Methode, die von Kriminellen verwendet wird, um ihre Aktivitäten und das damit verbundene Geld zu verschleiern und die Erträge aus ihren Verbrechen legitim erscheinen zu lassen. Dies wird oft durch eine komplexe Abfolge von Banküberweisungen oder kommerziellen Transaktionen erreicht, was die Rückverfolgung der ursprünglichen Geldquelle schwierig macht. Einige gut dokumentierte Beispiele für Geldwäsche sind die Verwendung von Bargeld für den Kauf von Lebensversicherungspolicen und deren anschließendes Verfallenlassen, der Kauf und Verkauf wertvoller Vermögenswerte wie Kunst und die Verwendung von [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) zur Verschleierung des Eigentums und des Transfers von Geldern, insbesondere im Immobiliensektor. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen bei [der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"handelsbasierte Geldwäsche\") und der Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen (MSBs) sind ebenfalls gängige Methoden zur Geldwäsche. ### Die Phasen der Geldwäsche Das Verständnis der [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) ist entscheidend, um diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Diese Phasen umfassen in der Regel die Platzierung, das Layering und die Integration. **Platzierung**: Dies ist der Prozess der Einführung des illegalen Geldes in das Finanzsystem. Dies kann durch die Aufteilung großer Bargeldbeträge in weniger auffällige kleinere Summen geschehen, die dann direkt auf ein Bankkonto eingezahlt werden, oder durch den Kauf einer Reihe von Instrumenten (wie Schecks oder Zahlungsanweisungen), die dann gesammelt und auf Konten an einem anderen Ort eingezahlt werden. **Schichtung**: In dieser Phase führt der Geldwäscher in der Regel eine Reihe von Umrechnungen oder Bewegungen der Gelder durch, um sie von ihrer Quelle zu entfernen. Das Layering kann aus mehreren Bank-zu-Bank-Überweisungen, Überweisungen zwischen verschiedenen Konten mit unterschiedlichen Namen in verschiedenen Ländern, Ein- und Auszahlungen bestehen, um den Geldbetrag auf den Konten kontinuierlich zu ändern, die Währung des Geldes zu ändern und hochwertige Gegenstände (wie Häuser oder Unternehmen) zu kaufen, um die Form des Geldes zu ändern. Dies wird manchmal als [komplexe Schichtung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) bezeichnet. **Integration**: Die letzte Phase des Prozesses. In der [Integrationsphase](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) gelangt das Geld in legitim aussehender Form wieder in die Mainstream-Ökonomie – es scheint aus einem legalen Geschäft zu stammen. Dabei kann es sich um eine abschließende Überweisung auf das Konto eines lokalen Unternehmens handeln, in das der Geldwäscher im Austausch für eine Gewinnkürzung „investiert“, um den Verkauf einer Immobilie, die während der Schichtungsphase gekauft wurde, oder einfach um die Ausgabe von Geld, das für Luxusgüter gewaschen wurde. Durch das Verständnis der Grundlagen der Geldwäsche und ihrer Phasen können sich Fachleute besser darauf vorbereiten, diese Aktivitäten zu erkennen und zu verhindern, die entscheidende Aspekte der [Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind. ## Ein Blick auf Beispiele aus dem wirklichen Leben Um die Dynamik der Geldwäsche besser zu verstehen, schauen wir uns Beispiele aus der Praxis an. Diese Fälle, in denen es um Lebensversicherungen, die Kunstwelt und Briefkastenfirmen im Immobilienbereich geht, enthüllen die komplizierten Strategien, mit denen illegale Gelder verschleiert werden. ### Geldwäsche durch Lebensversicherung Eine Methode der Geldwäsche sind Lebensversicherungen. Einzelpersonen verwenden Bargeld, um diese Policen zu kaufen, dann Kredite gegen sie aufzunehmen und schließlich die Policen verfallen zu lassen. Diese zirkuläre Methode verschleiert die Herkunft der Gelder und verleiht dem illegalen Bargeld einen Anstrich von Legitimität ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dieses Beispiel unterstreicht die Bedeutung von [Know-Your-Customer- (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) und [Kunden-Due-Diligence-Verfahren](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) im Versicherungssektor als Schlüsselkomponenten der [Anti-Geldwäsche-Compliance](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/). ### Geldwäsche in der Kunstwelt Die Kunstwelt ist ein weiterer Bereich, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Kriminelle kaufen und verkaufen wertvolle Kunstwerke, um die Herkunft des bei diesen Transaktionen verwendeten Bargelds zu verschleiern. Der hohe Wert von Kunstwerken, gepaart mit der subjektiven Natur ihrer Preisgestaltung, macht dies zu einem fruchtbaren Boden für Geldwäschesysteme. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit strenger Kontrollen und Transparenz bei hochwertigen Kunsttransaktionen. ### Briefkastenfirmen und Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen, insbesondere solche, an [denen Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) beteiligt sind, sind ein weiterer häufiger Kanal für Geldwäsche. Kriminelle kaufen Immobilien oft mit Bargeld und verschleiern ihr Eigentum durch Briefkastenfirmen oder versteckten Immobilienbesitz, um die Spur der Gelder zu verwischen und die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft zu erschweren ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). In einigen Fällen werden Immobilienbewertungen manipuliert, und Kriminelle arbeiten mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese illegale Praxis ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. In einem bemerkenswerten Fall hat ein Mann aus Honduras über 1 Million US-Dollar an Bestechungsgeldern durch internationale Überweisungen gewaschen, um Immobilien in New Orleans zu kaufen, darunter auch Büroräume ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). In einem anderen Fall soll eine Privatbank einem Konto des Vatikans erlaubt haben, 350 Millionen Dollar für Investitionen in Londoner Immobilien auszugeben und damit illegale Immobilientransaktionen zu erleichtern, darunter auch solche von Drogenhändlern, um Immobilien in Bulgarien zu kaufen ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, wie wichtig die Transparenz der [wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) bei Immobilientransaktionen ist und wie wichtig strenge Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in diesem Sektor sind. Sie heben auch die Herausforderungen hervor, mit denen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden bei der Verfolgung des Flusses illegaler Gelder konfrontiert sind, und die zentrale Rolle des [Offshore-Bankwesens](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) bei Geldwäschesystemen. ## Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche ist eine komplexe Form der Finanzkriminalität, bei der Handelstransaktionen genutzt werden, um illegal verdientes Geld zu verstecken, zu bewegen und zu investieren. Es ist neben Layering und Integration eine der drei grundlegenden Methoden der Geldwäsche, die alle in unserem Artikel über die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) untersucht werden können. ### Falsche Darstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen Bei handelsbasierter Geldwäsche werden der Preis, die Menge oder die Qualität von Waren oder Dienstleistungen falsch dargestellt, um Werte zwischen Ländern zu transferieren und die illegale Geldquelle zu verbergen ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Diese Methode kann sowohl in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) verwendet werden, um komplexe Transaktionsschichten zu erstellen, als auch in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) , um das gewaschene Geld wieder in die legale Wirtschaft einzuführen. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen kann verschiedene Formen annehmen, wie z. B. Überfakturierung, Unterfakturierung, Mehrfachrechnungsstellung oder falsche Beschreibung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen. Diese betrügerischen Praktiken werden häufig durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) und verschleierte [wirtschaftliche Eigentümerstrukturen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) erleichtert, was es den Behörden erschweren kann, diese Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu untersuchen. ### Fallstudien zur handelsbasierten Geldwäsche Ein bemerkenswertes Beispiel für handelsbasierte Geldwäsche war eine kriminelle Organisation, die unterbewertete Waren und gefälschte Rechnungen verwendete, um 1,8 Millionen US-Dollar an schmutzigem Geld zu waschen ([UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). In diesem Fall kaufte die Organisation Waren in einem Land zu einem niedrigen Preis und verkaufte sie dann in einem anderen Land zu einem viel höheren Preis. Die Preisdifferenz wurde zur Geldwäsche des Schwarzgeldes verwendet. Dieser Fall erinnert eindringlich daran, wie wichtig robuste Verfahren zur [Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind, einschließlich einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und einer kontinuierlichen Überwachung von Transaktionen. Durch das Verständnis der Techniken, die bei der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche eingesetzt werden, können Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, die mit dieser Art von illegalen Aktivitäten verbundenen Risiken besser erkennen und [mindern](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Minderung der Risiken\") . Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit einer kontinuierlichen Wachsamkeit und wirksamer Kontrollen im globalen Handelssektor. Da sich die von Kriminellen verwendeten Methoden ständig weiterentwickeln, ist es für Unternehmen von entscheidender Bedeutung, auf dem Laufenden zu bleiben und ihre [Strategien zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche\") entsprechend anzupassen. Durch das Verständnis der Taktiken, die bei der Geldwäsche angewendet werden, können Fachleute ihre Organisationen besser schützen und zum globalen Kampf gegen Finanzkriminalität beitragen. ## Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen Money Services Businesses (MSBs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle im globalen Finanzsystem und bieten Dienstleistungen wie Geldtransfer, Währungsumtausch und Scheckeinlösung an. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist jedoch zu einem erheblichen Problem bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche geworden, da diese Unternehmen die Bewegung von Geldern ohne angemessene Prüfung oder behördliche Aufsicht erleichtern können ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Nicht registrierte Geldübermittler Im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche nutzen Kriminelle häufig nicht registrierte Geldübermittler, eine Untergruppe von MSBs, aus, um illegale Gelder zu bewegen, ohne die Aufmerksamkeit der Behörden auf sich zu ziehen ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese nicht registrierten Unternehmen operieren unter dem Radar und umgehen die strengen Vorschriften und [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden,](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) denen traditionelle Finanzinstitute unterliegen. Überweisungen, die über diese nicht registrierten MSBs getätigt werden, hinterlassen möglicherweise keine Aufzeichnungen, was es schwierig macht, die ursprüngliche Quelle oder den endgültigen Bestimmungsort der Gelder zurückzuverfolgen. Dies macht sie zu einem idealen Kanal während der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/), in der das Ziel darin besteht, die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern. Die relative Leichtigkeit und Anonymität, die nicht registrierte Geldübermittler bieten, macht sie attraktiv für Kriminelle, die diese Dienste nutzen, um Geld unentdeckt über Grenzen zu bewegen. Dies ist eine große Herausforderung für [die weltweiten Bemühungen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche.](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) ### Fallstudien zum MSB-Missbrauch Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist leider keine Seltenheit, wobei zahlreiche Fälle auf der ganzen Welt verzeichnet wurden. So ist beispielsweise bekannt, dass Kriminelle MSBs nutzen, um Geld aus illegalen Aktivitäten wie Drogenhandel, Betrug und organisierter Kriminalität zu waschen. In vielen Fällen werden diese illegalen Gelder über nicht registrierte MSBs bewegt, was es für die Behörden schwierig macht, die Transaktionen zu erkennen und zurückzuverfolgen. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie wichtig eine solide regulatorische Aufsicht im Finanzsektor ist. Es unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit effektiver [Know-Your-Customer-Verfahren (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) einer strengen Überwachung von Transaktionen und einer gründlichen Due-Diligence-Prüfung, um einen solchen Missbrauch zu verhindern. Der Kampf gegen Geldwäsche ist kontinuierlich, wobei ständig neue Methoden und Techniken entstehen. Indem sie diese [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/) verstehen und daraus lernen, können sich Aufsichtsbehörden, Compliance-Beauftragte und Finanzinstitute besser darauf vorbereiten, illegale Geldflüsse in Zukunft zu erkennen und zu verhindern. ## Geldwäsche durch Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen bieten Kriminellen eine effektive Möglichkeit, illegale Gelder zu waschen. Die hochwertigen Transaktionen des Sektors in Kombination mit den oft komplexen rechtlichen und finanziellen Vereinbarungen stellen eine attraktive Gelegenheit für Kriminelle dar, die versuchen, ihre unrechtmäßig erworbenen Gewinne zu legitimieren. ### Kauf und Verkauf von Immobilien Eine gängige Methode, die Kriminelle anwenden, besteht darin, Immobilien mit Bargeld zu erwerben und deren Eigentum dann durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) oder verstecktes Eigentum zu verbergen ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Diese Methode verwischt die Spur der Gelder und erschwert die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft, was die Strafverfolgungsbehörden vor Herausforderungen stellt. Eine weitere Strategie ist die Manipulation von Immobilienbewertungen. Kriminelle arbeiten oft mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese Taktik ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. Kriminelle gründen auch Briefkastenfirmen in ausländischen Gerichtsbarkeiten, um Immobilien zu besitzen, was den grenzüberschreitenden Fluss illegaler Gelder erleichtert. Diese Methode erschwert es den Behörden, den Geldfluss zu verfolgen, und zeigt eine Methode, mit der Geldwäscheaktivitäten verschleiert werden. ### Fallstudien zur Geldwäsche im Immobilienbereich Immobiliengeldwäsche ist ein globales Problem. Laut einem Bericht von Global Financial Integrity (GFI) wurden von 2015 bis 2021 mehr als 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar über US-Immobilien gewaschen. Dies unterstreicht, dass Immobilien nach wie vor eine der beliebtesten Möglichkeiten sind, illegale Gelder zu bewegen. Ein weiteres Beispiel: In den letzten zehn Jahren flossen etwa 20 Milliarden US-Dollar in den Immobilienmarkt im Großraum Toronto in Kanada, ohne dass die Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörden eine angemessene Prüfung durchführten ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Region | Gewaschene Menge (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | USA | 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar | | Großraum Toronto, Kanada | 20 Milliarden US-Dollar | Diese Beispiele unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Wachsamkeit und wirksamer [Einhaltung der Geldwäschebekämpfung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) im Immobiliensektor. Wenn sie die Taktiken von Kriminellen verstehen und sich der [Warnsignale](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Rote Fahnen\") bewusst sind, können Fachleute im Immobiliensektor eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Unterbrechung dieser illegalen Finanzströme spielen. Für diejenigen, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, kann das Verständnis dieser [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) helfen, potenzielle Risiken zu identifizieren und effektive [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) zu implementieren. ## Geldwäsche-Skandale Trotz strenger [Compliance-Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) und behördlicher Kontrollen tauchen immer wieder Fälle von Geldwäsche in großem Maßstab auf. Schauen wir uns einige bemerkenswerte Geldwäscheskandale an, die in den letzten Jahren Schlagzeilen gemacht haben. ### Das FinCEN-Dateileck Im Jahr 2020 enthüllte das Durchsickern der FinCEN-Dateien (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) ein riesiges Netzwerk von Finanzkorruption. Über 400 Journalisten aus 88 Ländern arbeiteten an dieser Untersuchung zusammen und deckten verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von erstaunlichen 2 Billionen US-Dollar auf. Diese geheimen Dateien enthielten Informationen über Transaktionen, die von Banken als verdächtig gekennzeichnet wurden, aber fortgesetzt werden durften. Der Bericht hob schwerwiegende Versäumnisse in den globalen Bankensystemen hervor, die es ermöglichten, große Geldsummen ohne angemessene Kontrollen zu bewegen. Das FinCEN-Files-Leck unterstrich die Bedeutung einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der rigorosen Durchsetzung von [Know Your Customer (KYC)-](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) Vorschriften. Der Fall ist eine eindringliche Erinnerung an das potenzielle Ausmaß und die Komplexität von Geldwäscheoperationen. ### Das Panama-Papers-Leak Das Leak der Panama Papers im Jahr 2016 war eine monumentale Enthüllung, die zahlreiche aufsehenerregende Fälle von Geldwäsche, Steuerhinterziehung und Umgehung internationaler Sanktionen enthüllte. Das Leck betraf Banken, Anwaltskanzleien und hochkarätige Einzelpersonen weltweit und enthüllte das Ausmaß illegaler Finanzaktivitäten, die durch [Offshore-Banken](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) und [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) verschleiert wurden. Die Panama Papers hoben den Missbrauch anonymer Briefkastenfirmen hervor, um [wirtschaftliches Eigentum](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/). Infolgedessen führte der Skandal zu Forderungen nach mehr Transparenz bei Offshore-Finanzdienstleistungen und strengeren Vorschriften zur Identifizierung der wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer. ### Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon Der „Troika-Waschsalon“-Skandal umfasste die Geldwäsche von 4,6 Milliarden US-Dollar über ein Netzwerk von Scheinfirmen und illegale Finanztransaktionen zwischen 2006 und 2013. An diesem System waren mehrere Parteien in verschiedenen Gerichtsbarkeiten beteiligt, was die globale Reichweite von Geldwäscheoperationen zeigt. Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon brachte den Missbrauch von Briefkastenfirmen ans Licht, um die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/). Der Skandal führte zu Ermittlungen und rechtlichen Schritten, was die Bedeutung der globalen Zusammenarbeit bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche weiter unterstreicht. Jeder dieser Skandale unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche und die anhaltende Notwendigkeit von Wachsamkeit und Durchsetzung. Durch die Untersuchung dieser „Geldwäschebeispiele“ können Fachleute in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität ein tieferes Verständnis für die von Geldwäschern angewandten Taktiken erlangen und erfahren, wie diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufgedeckt und verhindert werden können. ## Aus Geldwäschefällen lernen Das Verständnis realer Szenarien ist eine der effektivsten Möglichkeiten, den komplexen Prozess der Geldwäsche zu verstehen. Dieser Abschnitt wirft einen genaueren Blick auf einige der bedeutendsten Geldwäschebeispiele der jüngeren Geschichte, um wertvolle Einblicke in den Ablauf dieser Ereignisse und die daraus gezogenen Lehren zu geben. ### Der Fall Wachovia Bank Im Jahr 2010 war die Wachovia Bank in eine umfangreiche Geldwäscheoperation verwickelt, an der mexikanische Drogenkartelle beteiligt waren. Zwischen 2004 und 2007 ermöglichte die Bank über ihre Filialen die Geldwäsche von fast 390 Milliarden US-Dollar. Die illegalen Gelder, die aus dem Drogenhandel in den USA stammten, wurden über die mexikanische Grenze geschmuggelt und später auf die US-Konten von Wachovia zurücküberwiesen. Die Bank hat es versäumt, die Herkunft dieser Gelder zu überprüfen und ist damit ihren [Know Your Customer (KYC)-Verpflichtungen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) nicht nachgekommen. Anstelle einer Strafverfolgung zahlte Wachovia eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 160 Millionen US-Dollar und versprach, seine [Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche (AML)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verbessern. ### Der Standardfall der Chartered Bank Die Standard Chartered Bank wurde wegen wiederholter Verstöße gegen US-Sanktionen mit hohen Strafen belegt. Nachdem die Bank 2012 zunächst mit einer Geldstrafe von 670 Millionen US-Dollar wegen Verstößen gegen den Iran belegt worden war, wurde sie 2019 erneut beschuldigt, Sanktionen gegen Länder wie Simbabwe, Burma, Iran, Sudan, Kuba und Syrien ignoriert zu haben. Für diese Verstöße verhängten die US-amerikanischen und britischen Behörden eine Geldstrafe von insgesamt 1,1 Milliarden US-Dollar gegen Standard Chartered und unterstrichen damit die schwerwiegenden Folgen einer Missachtung des Völkerrechts. ### Der Fall Danske Bank Die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank diente zwischen 2007 und 2015 als Kanal für geschätzte 228 Milliarden US-Dollar an gewaschenen Geldern. Dieser Skandal, in den Tausende von verdächtigen Kunden verwickelt waren, lenkte die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit auf die Compliance-Versäumnisse der Bank. Die dänischen Behörden verhängten Geldstrafen in Höhe von insgesamt 2 Millionen US-Dollar und wiesen mehreren Managern der Bank die Schuld zu. ### Der Fall BCCI Die Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) war an Betrugs [– und Geldwäscheaktivitäten](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) in Höhe von insgesamt bis zu 23 Milliarden US-Dollar beteiligt. Die BCCI nutzte ausgeklügelte Geldwäschesysteme wie [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/), Datenschutzoasen, Provisionen und Bestechung. Die Schließung der Bank im Jahr 1991 führte zu zahlreichen rechtlichen Schritten, darunter die Klage der BCCI gegen die Bank of England wegen Nachlässigkeit bei der Identifizierung von Frühwarnzeichen. Dieser Fall unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster AML-Compliance-Programme ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche unterstreichen die Bedeutung strenger AML-Verfahren, einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der Notwendigkeit, die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) zu verstehen, um Finanzkriminalität aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Indem sie aus diesen Fällen lernen, können Fachleute im Bereich Compliance und Risikomanagement ihre Unternehmen besser auf ähnliche Situationen vorbereiten und schützen.

Les blanchisseurs, pas de frontières. Ces derniers profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance et des législations européennes pour passer entre les mailles du filet. Avec la création, cet été, de l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (Anti-Money Laundering Authority ou AMLA), l’Union européenne peut-elle centraliser la lutte contre la finance illicite?** * * * L’inclusion probable et imminente de Monaco, symbole mondial de richesse et de discrétion, dans la [liste des pays à haut risque en matière de blanchiment d’argent](https://www.touteleurope.eu/economie-et-social/blanchiment-d-argent-quels-pays-sont-consideres-a-risque-par-la-commission-europeenne/) établie par l’Union européenne (UE), a suscité de nombreuses réactions. L’ajout potentiel de la principauté sur la liste noire met en évidence le défi que représente la lutte contre la finance illicite. Dans une zone comme l’UE, l’ouverture des frontières contraste avec la mise en œuvre et la surveillance des mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ([l’AML –Anti-Money Laundering](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en?prefLang=fr)). Des politiques qui restent largement confinées à la responsabilité des différents pays membres. Une [transaction financière](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022SC0344&utm_) peut commencer dans un pays à haut risque, passer par une banque européenne et se terminer par une transaction immobilière à Londres ou un trust suisse. C’est précisément pour cette raison que la coordination internationale est si importante. Sans elle, les blanchisseurs d’argent profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance, en particulier au sein de l’UE. Avec l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent , ou Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), qui entre en fonction cet été, l’Union européenne opte pour la [centralisation](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jfc-03-2023-0059/full/pdf). Les politiques européennes et françaises de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ont échoué [pour plusieurs raisons](https://op.europa.eu/fr/publication-detail/-/publication/03f702aa-03bb-11ec-8f47-01aa75ed71a1/language-fr): une application inégale des réglementations, un manque de ressources et de coopération internationale, des sanctions peu dissuasives face à des techniques toujours plus sophistiquées et un phénomène global difficile à cerner. Pour progresser, il faut renforcer l’harmonisation des règles, augmenter les moyens des autorités, adopter des technologies avancées et améliorer la transparence des structures. Des objectifs que l’AMLA a précisément [vocation à concrétiser](https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en). Cent milliards d’euros par an ----------------------------- Quelques rares et prudentes estimations confirment que les flux financiers illicites traversent trop facilement les frontières et que leurs montants sont colossaux. Selon les estimations de l’Office des Nations unies contre la drogue et le crime (ONUDC), le [blanchiment d’argent représenterait de 2% à 5% du PIB mondial, soit de 800 milliards à 2 000 milliards de dollars américains](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) actuels. Dans l’Union européenne, le produit des activités criminelles est [estimé à plus de 100 milliards d’euros par an](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/criminal_asset_recovery_in_the_eu_web_version_0.pdf), dont seul un pourcentage négligeable est finalement saisi. [Des recherches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75653-x) estiment que l’argent provenant du trafic de drogue, du trafic des personnes et du terrorisme passe souvent par des banques de 4 à 6 pays différents avant d’être blanchi et d’entrer dans l’économie légale. * * * ![Image 7](https://images.theconversation.com/files/652674/original/file-20250303-32-etg46y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip) _Du lundi au vendredi + le dimanche, recevez gratuitement les analyses et décryptages de nos experts pour un autre regard sur l’actualité.

La [Danske Bank](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180924-danemark-estonie-danske-bank-scandale-oligarque) est devenue l’épicentre du plus grand scandale de blanchiment d’argent en Europe. Il a été révélé que plus de 200 milliards d’euros de transactions suspectes ont transité par sa succursale estonienne. La [Deutsche Bank](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/banque-assurances/des-centaines-de-milliards-de-dollars-dargent-sale-blanchis-par-de-grandes-banques-1244280) a fait l’objet de multiples enquêtes pour avoir facilité des transferts illicites de plusieurs milliards d’euros, notamment par le biais de sa collaboration avec Danske et de ses liens avec le système _Russian Laundromat_. [ING](https://trends.levif.be/a-la-une/banque/ing-a-verse-775-millions-deuros-pour-regler-une-affaire-de-blanchiment/) a payé une amende de 775 millions d’euros aux autorités néerlandaises pour des violations de la législation anti-blanchiment en 2018. Tracfin en France ----------------- Les pays de l’Union européenne mettent en œuvre les directives européennes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, avec des niveaux d’ambition variables. La France a montré un [engagement ferme](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin/la-qualite-du-dispositif-francais-de-lbc-ft-reconnue-par-le-gafi) dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent grâce à l’approche de sa cellule de renseignement financier, [Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins (Tracfin)](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin). Elle a récemment renforcé son analyse des [transactions suspectes](https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/4153148-20250513-tracfin-recu-nombre-record-declarations-soupcon-2024), élargi sa coopération avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux et amélioré son utilisation des analyses de données avancées pour détecter les flux illicites complexes. Malgré ces progrès, certaines affaires récentes, comme les failles des [néobanques](https://theconversation.com/qonto-monabanq-hellobank-lascension-des-neobanques-ira-t-elle-trop-loin-242541) ou l’enquête visant BNP Paribas pour blanchiment via [Chypre](https://decouverte.challenges.fr/economie/france-bnp-paribas-pris-dans-une-enquete-pour-blanchiment-aggrave-liee-a-chypre_878359), montrent que des flux illicites échappent encore à la détection de Tracfin. Dissuader les défaillances des contrôles bancaires internes ----------------------------------------------------------- Malgré son poids économique, l’Allemagne a été [critiquée](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/cash-hungry-germany-criticised-by-watchdog-over-money-laundering) pour son implication insuffisante, ainsi que pour les défaillances de sa surveillance. La mise en œuvre de sa politique varie d’un Land à l’autre; les difficultés rencontrées en matière de coopération internationale, en particulier avant l’effondrement de la société spécialisée dans le paiement électronique Wirecard, n’aident pas. En revanche, les autorités néerlandaises ont suivi l’exemple des États-Unis. Ils ont infligé des amendes importantes à des établissements tels que [ING](https://www.prosecutionservice.nl/latest/news/2018/09/04/ing-pays-775-million-due-to-serious-shortcomings-in-money-laundering-prevention) et [ABN AMRO](https://apnews.com/article/business-netherlands-money-laundering-b7c07284946e1561c1f2231de30dcfef), démontrant ainsi leur ferme volonté de lutter contre la criminalité financière en dissuadant les défaillances des contrôles internes dans les banques. * * * _**Read more: [Credit Suisse: les leçons d’une lente descente aux enfers](https://theconversation.com/credit-suisse-les-lecons-dune-lente-descente-aux-enfers-202363)**_ * * * Ces approches inégales de la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans les États membres de l’UE s’expliquent par [plusieurs facteurs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0170_EN.html). Les différentes interprétations des règles en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent créent des lacunes dans la couverture juridique. Une coopération judiciaire transfrontalière irrégulière, en particulier avec les pays tiers, entrave l’efficacité de l’application de la législation. En outre, les cellules de renseignement financier ont des pouvoirs et des responsabilités très variables. L’absence de format standardisé pour les déclarations d’opérations suspectes complique l’intégration des données dans la plate-forme centrale de l’Union européenne. Elle rend la coordination des actions plus difficile qu’elle ne devrait l’être. Mais tout cela est sur le point de changer… Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AMLA) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Pour remédier à ces faiblesses, l’Union européenne est en train de créer l’[Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/753212c5-166b-48ae-a44f-ffbb09a1eede/files/3de11274-cba7-414d-b0dd-6fbfcabf4d10), ou _Anti-Money Laundering Authority_ (AMLA). Elle devrait être pleinement opérationnelle à partir de 2028. Basée à Francfort, l’AMLA supervisera directement une quarantaine d’établissements financiers transfrontaliers à haut risque, harmonisera l’application des règles dans les États membres et coordonnera les régulateurs nationaux. Elle aura le pouvoir de mener des inspections sur place, d’imposer des sanctions et de renforcer le cadre global de l’UE en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. ![Image 8](https://images.theconversation.com/files/678599/original/file-20250707-56-wmpqc5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip) L’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, créée en 2024 par l’Union européenne, est chargée de la traque des flux financiers suspects.[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stuttgart-germany-03102025-person-holding-cellphone-2604415937) Afin de soutenir le rôle de l’AMLA, l’UE introduit un règlement unique qui remplacera les différentes législations nationales par un ensemble de normes unifiées dans tous les États membres. Avec l’AMLA, Bruxelles parie que la centralisation peut réussir là où la décentralisation a échoué. La décentralisation signifie que chaque État membre appliquait les règles anti-blanchiment à sa manière, en transposant les directives européennes dans son droit national. Cela a conduit à des normes [contradictoires](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12027-024-00805-9). Par exemple, certains pays imposaient des seuils de déclaration différents ou avaient des définitions divergentes des entités à surveiller, rendant la coopération inefficace et les contrôles inégaux. Avertissement symbolique ------------------------ L’AMLA pourrait se heurter à des difficultés. La complexité des différences juridiques et institutionnelles entre les États membres, la mobilisation de nombreuses expertises pour superviser un large éventail de secteurs, pourrait rendre ce travail fastidieux. La nécessité de trouver un équilibre entre les préoccupations en matière de souveraineté nationale et la nécessité d’une application efficace et unifiée dans toute l’UE également. Alors que l’Union européenne se prépare à lancer l’AMLA, l’inclusion de pays comme Monaco sur sa liste noire est un avertissement symbolique. Désormais, aucune juridiction, aussi riche ou prestigieuse soit-elle, n’est à l’abri d’un examen minutieux. Le devenir de l’AMLA comme véritable autorité de contrôle puissante dépendra de trois piliers: la volonté politique, la solidité de sa conception institutionnelle et l’ampleur des moyens humains et techniques qui lui seront alloués. Sans volonté politique, l’AMLA risque d’être affaiblie par les intérêts nationaux. Sans conception institutionnelle solide, ses compétences pourraient se heurter à des obstacles juridiques et bureaucratiques. Sans moyens humains et techniques suffisants, elle ne pourra pas exercer une supervision directe et efficace sur les entités à haut risque ni coordonner les autorités nationales. * [Union européenne (UE)](https://theconversation.com/topics/union-europeenne-ue-20281) * [frontières](https://theconversation.com/topics/frontieres-20283) * [finance](https://theconversation.com/topics/finance-20382) * [entreprises](https://theconversation.com/topics/entreprises-20563) * [Organisation des Nations unies (ONU)](https://theconversation.com/topics/organisation-des-nations-unies-onu-20684) * [fraude](https://theconversation.com/topics/fraude-21144) * [droit](https://theconversation.com/topics/droit-21145) * [économie](https://theconversation.com/topics/economie-23177) * [coopération](https://theconversation.com/topics/cooperation-29450) * [mafia](https://theconversation.com/topics/mafia-30332) * [crime](https://theconversation.com/topics/crime-61345) * [fraude fiscale](https://theconversation.com/topics/fraude-fiscale-111273) * [« Entreprise(s) »](https://theconversation.com/topics/entreprise-s-137378) ### Want to write?

Das unter Führung der S&D-Fraktion ausgehandelte Gesetzespaket wird die Spielregeln stark verändern und dazu beitragen, Skandale zu verhindern, wie wir sie in den letzten Jahren nur allzu oft erlebt haben. Das übergeordnete Ziel der neuen Rechtsvorschriften ist die Vereinheitlichung der geltenden nationalen Regeln – die zu fragmentiert und nicht gut aufeinander abgestimmt sind –, mit dem Ziel, die Vorschriften besser durchsetzen zu können und den gemeinsamen Kampf gegen Geldwäsche zu verstärken. Die Bedeutung der neuen Regeln lässt sich anhand einiger konkreter Beispiele illustrieren: Für Superreiche, zu denen auch russische Oligarchen zählen, wird es sehr viel schwerer, das System zu überlisten und Kontrollen zu umgehen. Die Vorschriften dienen außerdem dazu, im Fußball aufzuräumen, und die Risiken einzudämmen, die aus der Vergabe „goldener Visa“ resultieren. **Eero** **Heinäluoma, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Wirtschaftsausschuss, sagte:** „Heute ist ein guter Tag für die Bürger und Unternehmen in der EU und ein schlechter Tag für Oligarchen und Terroristen. Die lang erwartete Reform war angesichts der Skandale in den letzten Jahren, an denen die Danske Bank und die Credit Suisse beteiligt waren, und der jüngsten Enthüllungen aus Zypern wahrhaft notwendig. Die neuen Regeln werden die Dunkelmänner hinter undurchsichtigen rechtlichen Strukturen ans Licht bringen. Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt zu mehr Unternehmenstransparenz. Sie gilt auch für Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU: Falls diese in der EU Geschäfte machen wollen, müssen sie ihre Eigentumsverhältnisse im Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer offenlegen. Da bei der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung Bargeld eine große Rolle spielt, werden Barzahlungen über 10.000 Euro in der EU verboten. Dadurch können Transaktionen mithilfe hoher Geldbeträge besser kontrolliert werden, um Geldwäsche zu verhindern.“ **Paul Tang, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Justizausschuss, meinte:** „Eins unserer Hauptziele war, dafür zu sorgen, dass Wirtschaftskriminelle nicht länger durch den Kauf teurer Autos, Jachten und Privatflugzeuge Geldwäsche betreiben können. Die neuen Vorschriften erschweren es den Reichen und Mächtigen, ohne richtige Kontrollen in der EU zu investieren und Sanktionen zu umgehen, da ihre Prestigeobjekte nun den Behörden gemeldet werden müssen. Durch diese historische Einigung entstehen das erste einheitliche europäische Regelwerk zur Geldwäschebekämpfung und eine neue EU-Behörde mit umfassenden Kontroll- und Koordinierungsbefugnissen. Nicht nur der Finanz-, sondern auch der Nichtfinanzsektor wird künftig wesentlich strengeren Regeln und einer verstärkten Aufsicht unterworfen. Wichtig ist, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten.“ **Hinweis für die Redaktion:** Das Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket besteht aus einer Verordnung und einer Richtlinie zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung sowie einer Verordnung zur Errichtung einer neuen EU-Behörde, deren Aufgabe es sein wird, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung zu unterbinden. Über die letztgenannte Verordnung wurde bereits letzten Monat Einigkeit erzielt, während der Rest des Pakets gestern Abend festgezurrt wurde. **Hier eine Liste der wichtigsten von der S&D-Fraktion durchgesetzten Punkte in dem Paket:** **In der Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Erweiterung der Liste von Einrichtungen, die die Vorschriften befolgen müssen, um hochrangige Profifußballvereine und -agenten, Anbieter von Kryptowerten, Vermittler von „goldenen Visa“ sowie Personen, die mit Luxusgütern handeln. Da das Fußballgeschäft und seine Risiken in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten jedoch sehr unterschiedlich sind, können für kleinere Vereine Ausnahmen gelten, falls das Risiko nachweislich gering ist und sie von der Kommission genehmigt werden. Die neuen Regeln im Bereich des Fußballs müssen erst fünf Jahre nach ihrem Inkrafttreten angewendet werden statt nach drei Jahren wie bei allen anderen Verpflichteten. * Einstufung der Bürgermeister bestimmter Städte sowie der Geschwister von Regierungsmitgliedern und anderen hochrangigen Politikern als „politisch exponierte Personen“, für die eine höhere Sorgfaltspflicht gilt * Aufnahme gezielter Sanktionen in die Rechtsvorschriften, damit Instrumente zur Geldwäschebekämpfung eingesetzt werden können, mit denen sich versuchte Sanktionsumgehungen aufdecken lassen * Eindämmung der Risiken, die von Personen ausgehen, die sich Aufenthaltsrechte durch Investitionen erkaufen wollen, auch als „goldene Visa“ bekannt, mittels eines neuen Kontrollregimes, bei dem die Antragsteller stärker kontrolliert werden * Einführung eines komplett harmonisierten Regelwerks für wirtschaftliches Eigentum, das bessere Einblicke in die Eigentümer von Unternehmen in Hochrisikosektoren erlaubt, sowie Sicherstellung, dass Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU in bestimmten Fällen ihre wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer in EU-Register eintragen müssen, etwa wenn sie Immobilien in der EU erwerben oder besitzen * Sicherstellung, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten: Wir haben dafür gesorgt, dass dieser Sektor bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung denselben Vorschriften und Pflichten unterliegt wie der traditionelle Finanzsektor, insbesondere was die Sorgfaltspflicht bei Feststellung der Kundenidentität und die Pflichten hinsichtlich der Korrespondenzbankbeziehungen angeht. * Einführung einer Meldepflicht bei Handelsgeschäften mit hochwertigen Gütern wie Luxusautos, Flugzeugen und Booten, die die Verpflichteten bei den Zentralstellen für Geldwäsche-Verdachtsanzeigen (FIU) melden müssen * Verschärfung der Wachsamkeit in Bezug auf hochvermögende Kunden mit hohem Risiko * Verbot von Barzahlungen von über 10.000 Euro **In der Richtlinie zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Einführung strengerer Zulassungs- und Registrierungsanforderungen für Verpflichtete und von Befugnissen für die Aufsichtsbehörden zur Überprüfung der fachlichen Eignung und Zuverlässigkeit von Führungskräften * Stärkung der Verantwortung und Verbesserung der Vorgaben für die Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer in den Mitgliedstaaten: Nach den neuen Regeln sind die EU-Länder befugt, zu überprüfen, ob die Angaben zu den wirtschaftlichen Eigentümern angemessen, präzise und aktuell sind. * Einführung klarer Regeln, die sicherstellen, dass Journalisten, die Zivilgesellschaft und andere, die ein berechtigtes Interesse geltend machen, Zugang zu den Angaben haben * Verpflichtung der Mitgliedstaaten, ihre Regeln für die Vergabe „goldener Visa“ so zu ändern, dass die Risiken gemindert werden, sowie Übertragung der Befugnis an die Kommission, die Bemühungen zur Risikominderung zu bewerten * Einrichtung einer zentralen Zugangsstelle für die nationalen zentralen Meldestellen (FIU), über die Informationen über Immobilienbesitzer abgefragt werden können * Verbesserung des Zugangs der zentralen Meldestellen zu Informationen aus verschiedenen Quellen und Ausbau der EU-weiten Zusammenarbeit zwischen diesen Stellen, um sie in die Lage zu versetzen, bei komplexen oder grenzüberschreitenden Fällen mit Unterstützung der europäischen Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörde (AMLA) gemeinsame Analysen vorzunehmen * Verbesserung des Aufsichtsrahmens und der Zusammenarbeit unter der Ägide der ALMA und vermehrte Beaufsichtigung des Nichtfinanzsektors, insbesondere durch die Möglichkeit der Einrichtung von Kollegien * Sicherstellung eines stärker harmonisierten, wirkungsvollen und abschreckenden Rahmens für Geldstrafen und Verwaltungssanktionen **In der Verordnung** **zur Errichtung der europäischen Anti‑Geldwäsche-Behörde (AMLA):** * Ausweitung des Geltungsbereichs der direkten Beaufsichtigung durch die Behörde auf eine größere Gruppe von Unternehmen, darunter Anbieter von Kryptowerten * Einrichtung besonderer Befugnisse, damit die Behörde bei Aufsichtsversagen eingreifen und selbst Aufsichtsaufgaben übernehmen oder auch Verfahren wegen Verletzung des Unionsrechts einleiten kann * Sicherstellung einer wirksamen Rolle für die Behörde zur Unterstützung der Finanzermittlungsstellen und zur Koordinierung von deren Tätigkeiten, insbesondere durch Mithilfe bei gemeinsamen Analysen * Übertragung der Befugnis an die Behörde, Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den Finanzaufsichtsbehörden verbindlich beizulegen und als Vermittler zwischen Aufsichtsbehörden im Nichtfinanzbereich aufzutreten * Sicherstellung neuer Kompetenzen für die Behörde zur Beaufsichtigung des Nichtfinanzsektors, einschließlich der Befugnis, bei Versagen der nationalen Aufsichtsbehörden einzuschreiten ##

Nov. 2017 | 09:00 Uhr | von Gerd Mischler Aktualisiert am: 16. Jan. 2024 ## Wirecard, Siemens, VW # Die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale in Deutschland Manager-Versagen oder kriminelle Energie: Für diese 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale mussten die Beteiligten oft beides aufbringen. Diese Firmen waren mit besonderem „Engagement“ dabei. Können Sie sich noch erinnern? Schon so einige deutsche Unternehmen und Manager haben Negativschlagzeilen gemacht. Wir haben die größten Skandale für Sie zusammengestellt. (Bild: Goss Vitalij - stock.adobe.com) Ob Steuerbetrug, Schneeballsystem oder großflächige Bilanzfälschung: Deutsche Unternehmen haben sich in der Vergangenheit einiges einfallen lassen, um in die (negativen) Schlagzeilen zu kommen. Wir haben die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale zusammengetragen – garantiert subjektiv und ausdrücklich nicht wertfrei. #### Platz 10: Arcandor – Thomas Middelhoff veruntreut Millionen Obwohl es ihm nicht gelungen war, den Handelskonzern Arcandor und seine Töchter Karstadt, Quelle, Primondo und Thomas Cook zu retten, lässt sich Vorstandschef Thomas Middelhoff kurz vor der Pleite im Jahr 2009 rund 2,3 Millionen Euro Bonus auszahlen. Dafür wurde er wegen Veruntreuung zu drei Jahren Haft verurteilt, von denen er zwei absitzen musste. Middelhoff pendelte außerdem auf Firmenkosten für 1,1 Millionen Euro mit dem Hubschrauber von seiner Villa in Bielefeld zur Arbeit in die Essener Arcandorzentrale und ließ sich mit Privatjets in seine Villa in St. Tropez und nach New York fliegen. Einen Beigeschmack hinterließ auch der Verkauf von fünf Immobilien an einen Fonds, an dem Middelhoff und seine Frau beteiligt waren. Der Fonds vermietete die fünf Kaufhäuser für durchschnittlich gut 8,5 Millionen Jahresmiete an Karstadt. Für ihre 164 anderen Filialen zahlte die Kette dagegen nur jeweils 1,7 Millionen Euro Miete. #### Platz 9: Mannesmann-Vodafone – Abfindungsaffäre bei Übernahme Der Deal ist perfekt. Am 4. Februar 2000 stimmt nach einer spektakulären Abwehrschlacht der Mannesmann-Aufsichtsrat der Übernahme des Industriekonzerns durch Vodafone für 178 Milliarden Euro zu. Noch am selben Tag verteilen im Aufsichtsratsausschuss für Vorstandsangelegenheiten Deutsche-Bank-Vorstand Josef Ackermann, Mannesmann-Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Funk und IG-Metall-Boss Klaus Zwickel 30 Millionen Euro „Anerkennungsprämien“ an Topmanager bei Mannesmann. Obwohl eine Stuttgarter Kanzlei deshalb am 24. Februar 2000 Anzeige wegen des Verdachts auf Untreue erstattet, verteilt der Ausschuss im März weitere 32 Millionen Euro an bereits pensionierte Mannesmann-Vorstände. Das Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf spricht Ackermann, Funk und Zwickel zunächst vom Vorwurf der Untreue frei. Später hebt der Bundesgerichtshof das Urteil auf. Im zweiten Anlauf wird das Verfahren gegen eine Zahlung von 5,8 Millionen Euro eingestellt. ## Platz 8: Flowtex - Schneeballsystem mit fiktiven Bohrmaschinen In den 90er Jahren betrog der badische Unternehmer Manfred Schmider Banken und Versicherungen um rund zwei Milliarden Euro. Seine Firma Flowtex produzierte Horizontalbohrsysteme, mit denen man unterirdisch Kabel verlegt, ohne die Straßen aufzureißen. Flowtex verkaufte zahlreiche dieser Systeme an Investoren und leaste sie anschließend zurück. Dieses Vorgehen ist an sich nicht unüblich, nur dass in diesem Fall die meisten der Geräte gar nicht existierten. Das Unternehmen täuschte einen hohen Bestand an Bohrern vor, indem es an die wenigen real exisiterenden Systeme immer neue Seriennummern schraubte. Um die Leasingraten zahlen zu können, musste die Firma im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr fiktive Maschinen verkaufen – es war ein Schneeballsystem. Im Februar 2000, nur Tage vor dem geplanten Börsengang, wurden Schmider und weitere Verantwortliche festgenommen. Er war sieben Jahre in Haft, bevor er auf Bewährung entlassen wurde. Im Jahr 2016 wurde er in der Schweiz dann erneut zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt - wegen Geldwäsche. ## Das sind die 6 größten Schneeballsysteme der Geschichte 1. **Madoff Investment Securities**. Anlageverluste: 60 Milliarden Euro - Die nach ihrem Gründer Bernhard Madoff benannte Investmentfirma galt lange Zeit als einer der zuverlässigsten Partner an der Wall Street. Allerdings stellte sich 40 Jahre später heraus, dass Madoff die Renditen seiner Kunden mit den Einlagen neuer Kunden bezahlte. Seine Söhne zeigten ihn schließlich an und ein Gericht verurteilte ihn zu 150 Jahren Gefängnis. Sein Betrug betraf Millionen von Menschen und trieb etliche in den Selbstmord. 2. **MMM.** Anlageverluste: Über 1,85 Milliarden Euro - 1989 gründete Sergey Mavrodi in Moskau mit seinem Bruder und seiner Frau MMM. Das Unternehmen verkaufte sehr erfolgreich Bürogeräte, bis Probleme mit dem Finanzamt auftraten. Daraufhin wechselte MMM in den Finanzsektor und gab alsbald eigene Aktien heraus. Diese wurden ohne erkennbaren Grund stetig teurer. Die Zahl der Anleger stieg rapide an, nachdem eine Rendite von bis zu 1.000 Prozent kolportiert wurde. Innerhalb von sechs Monaten stieg der Wert der Wertpapiere um das 127-fache. Im Jahr 1994 versprach das Unternehmen Dividenden in Höhe von 3.000 Prozent pro Jahr. Allerdings wurden die hohen Zinsen auf alte Einlagen immer nur durch das Anziehen neuer Einlagen finanziert. Als das Geld nicht mehr ausreichte, reduzierte MMM die Papiere auf den Ausgabewert. Das System brach zusammen. Unmittelbar nach dieser Nachricht begingen 50 Menschen Selbstmord. Mavrodi wurde verhaftet und verurteilt. Seine Machenschaften betrafen rund 15 Millionen Menschen. 3. **Stanford International Bank**. Anlageverlust: 7,4 Milliarden Euro - Der erfolglose Immobilienmakler Robert Allen Stanford gründete 1986 in Antigua und Barbuda die Stanford International Bank. Diese Bank gab Einlagenzertifikate als Alternative zu einer Einlage aus und warb mit Renditen weit über dem Marktwert. Die Einlagen schienen durch das Vermögen gedeckt zu sein, da Stanford die Bilanzen der Bank frisierte. Die hohen Zinsen auf die Einlagenzertifikate wurden tatsächlich nur durch das Geld neuer Anleger gezahlt. Dies funktionierte 23 Jahre lang, bis Robert Allen Stanford im Jahr 2012 wegen Betrugs zu einer Haftstrafe von 110 Jahren verurteilt wurde. 4. **European Kings Club**. Anlageverlust: 1 Milliarde Euro´- Der Fall \\'European Kings Club\\' war das größte europäische Schneeballsystem und war von 1992 bis 1994 im DACH-Bereich aktiv. Der Klub sollte seinen Mitgliedern, KMU-Unternehmern, finanzielle Unterstützung bieten. Um Mitglied zu werden, musste man sich einen Anteil für umgerechnet 715 Euro kaufen. Dafür sollten dann jeden Monat etwa 102 Euro ausgezahlt werden - natürlich mit den Anteilserlösen der neuesten Mitglieder. Das funktionierte, bis die Behörden die Gründerin des Clubs, Damara Bertges, und ihren Partner verhafteten. Die Finanzämter beschlagnahmten 255,6 Millionen Euro und gaben sie an die Investoren zurück. 5. **Caritas / John Stoica**. Anlageverluste: 930 Millionen Euro - Innerhalb eines Jahres betrog John Stoica mit seiner Firma Caritas (die Namensgleichheit mit der karitativen kirchlichen Organisation war beabsichtigt) rund 4 Millionen Rumänen. Er versprach Zinsen von 800 Prozent in 3 Monaten. Sogar Teile der Regierung und Verwaltung unterstützten das Unternehmen. Das Schneeballsystem brach schnell zusammen. Viele Rumänen hatten investiert und es bestand die Furcht vor Straßenprotesten und weiteren Reaktionen wütender Investoren. Caritas nahm etwa 3 Milliarden US-Dollar ein und besaß auf dem Höhepunkt des Erfolgs ein Drittel aller rumänischen Banknoten. John Stoica verbrachte 1,5 Jahre im Gefängnis. 6. **Mutual Benefits Corporation**. Anlageverluste: 1,15 Milliarden Euro - Im Jahr 1994 gründete Joel Steinger die Mutual Benefits Corporation, obwohl die US-Börsenaufsichtsbehörde den Verkauf von Wertpapieren bereits verboten hatte. Die Vorgehensweise war folgende: Die Mutual Benefits Corporation kaufte Versicherungspolicen von Patienten mit unheilbaren Krankheiten, verkaufte sie an Dritte weiter und wurde zum Vermittler zwischen der Versicherungsgesellschaft und den neuen Eigentümern. Diese zahlten monatliche Beiträge und sollten im Gegenzug einen guten Prozentsatz der Sterbegeldzahlung erhalten. Das Unternehmen lieferte falsche Berichte über die Krankheiten der Versicherungsnehmer. Da jedoch kaum jemand tatsächlich starbst, wurden mit dem Geld neuer Investoren alte Investoren bezahlt. Im Jahr 2001 übergab ein Mitarbeiter von Mutual Benefits Informationen an die Polizei. Joel Steinger wurde daraufhin im Jahr 2014 zu 20 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. #### Platz 7: MAN – Schmiergeldauszahlungen in bar Dreist: Wer im Dienste der Volkswagentochter bis 2009 Kunden schmieren wollte, ließ sich die erforderliche Summe in bar an der Kasse auszahlen. Später verschleierte der Münchner Nutzfahrzeughersteller die Korruption mit Briefkastenfirmen und Scheinverträgen mit vermeintlichen Beratern in Slowenien und Liechtenstein. Die insgesamt rund 50 Millionen Schmiergelder schlug [MAN](https://www.produktion.de/schwerpunkte/mega-maschinen/man-und-basf-wollen-die-groesste-waermepumpe-der-welt-bauen-691.html) auf den Preis für seine Busse und Lkw drauf. So ließen sich die Münchner den Betrug von den Steuerzahlern in den Abnehmerstaaten finanzieren. Im Jahr 2009 flogen die Machenschaften auf. Die Affäre kostete MAN über 250 Millionen Euro – größter Posten war mit 150,6 Millionen Euro die Geldbuße der Staatsanwaltschaft. #### Platz 6: Scania - Rekord-Bußgeld für LKW-Kartell 1997 bis 2010 sprachen sich mehrere europäische LKW-Hersteller über Preise ab und über die Einführung neuer Emissionstechnologien sowie die Weitergabe der damit verbundenen Kosten. Die ersten Treffen der leitenden Manager:innen fanden in Brüssel und auf Messen statt. Später verlagerte sich die Organisation zu den Tochterunternehmen der deutschen Hersteller. MAN ließ das Kartell schließlich auffliegen und ging als Kronzeuge straffrei aus, während die anderen Hersteller Geldbußen zahlen mussten. DAF, Daimler Iveco und Volvo/Renault teilten sich eine Rekord-Kartellbuße von insgesamt 2,93 Milliarden Euro. Scania arbeitete nicht mit den Ermittlern zusammen und büßte deshalb in einem getrennten Verfahren mit 880 Millionen Euro. #### Platz 5: Siemens – Größter Schmiergeldskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte Am 15. November 2006 durchsuchen Fahnder Büros an 30 [Siemens](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft/175-jahre-siemens-vom-zeigertelegraf-zum-digitalisierer-337.html)-Standorten. Auch Privatwohnungen führender Manager des Konzerns blieben nicht unbehelligt. Sie finden Beweise für wenigstens 4.300 Schmiergeldzahlungen. Damit hatte sich der Elektronik- und Telekommunikationskonzern zwischen 1999 und 2006 Aufträge in Ägypten, Saudi-Arabien, Indonesien und Griechenland erkauft. Insgesamt 1,3 Milliarden Euro blätterten die Münchner dafür hin. Außerdem unterhielt der Dax-Konzern mit mehreren Hundert Millionen Euro gefüllte schwarze Kassen in Österreich, Liechtenstein und der Schweiz und machte sich so der Geldwäsche schuldig. Aufsichtsratchef Heinrich von Pierer und Vorstandsvorsitzender Klaus Kleinfeld müssen ihren Hut nehmen. Der Skandal kostet Siemens rund 2,9 Milliarden Euro an Strafen, Steuernachzahlungen und Anwaltskosten. ## Platz 4: Deutsche Bank - dienstbar für Geldwäsche im großen Stil Wenn es um Skandale geht, darf die Deutsche Bank nicht fehlen. Jahrelang drückte sie gern ein Auge zu, wenn es um verdächtige Geldflüsse ging und musste in den USA und Großbritannien deshalb diverse Strafen begleichen: 2017 zahlte sie 630 Millionen US-Dollar, weil sie verdächtigen Geldflüssen aus Russland nicht nachgegangen war. Zusätzlich kam im selben Jahr noch eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 41 Millionen US-Dollar dazu, weil sie Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche nicht eingehalten hatte. Dagegen ist die diesjährige Strafzahlung gar nicht so teuer: \"Nur\" 186 Millionen Dollar forderte die FED im Juli 2023 von der Bank - auch diesmal wegen ungenügender Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche. Es geht um die frühere Geschäftsbeziehung zur estnischen Tochter der Danske Bank. Die Danske Bank hatte in den Jahren 2008 bis 2016 diverse US-Banken betrogen und wurde in einem der größten US-Geldwäscheskandale zu einer Milliarden-Geldbuße verurteilt. Die Deutsche Bank wickelte verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von mehr als 267 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Danske Bank ab. #### Platz 3: Volkswagen-Dieselbetrug – Größter Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte In der Motorsteuerung von wenigstens elf Millionen Fahrzeugen verbaute Volkswagen bis 2015 illegale Abschalteinrichtungen. Damit ist „Dieselgate“ der größte Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte und ein schamloser Betrug an Kunden und Behörden. Verwickelt in die kriminellen Machenschaften sind fast alle Marken des Konzerns sowie der Zulieferer Bosch. Die Konzerntochter Audi soll bei der Entwicklung der verbotenen Software eine Vorreiterrolle gespielt haben. Der Dieselbetrug kostete den langjährigen [VW](https://www.produktion.de/rohstoffe/schrott/georgsmarienhuette-und-vw-recyceln-schrott-gemeinsam-617.html)-Chef Martin Winterkorn den Job. Ein Strafverfahren wegen möglicher Marktmanipulation gegen VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess und Aufsichtsratschef Hans Dieter Pötsch wurde gegen eine Zahlung von neun Millionen Euro eingestellt. Rupert Stadler wurde wegen Betrugs zu einer Bewährungsstrafe von einem Jahr und neun Monaten sowie einem Bußgeld von 1,1 Millionen Euro verurteilt. ## Platz 2: Wirecard - spektakulärster Bilanzskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte An der Geschäftspraxis und den Bilanzzahlen des deutschen Fintech-Hoffnungsträgers Wirecard kamen schon mehr als ein Jahrzehnt vor der Insolvenz Zweifel auf, aber die Firma schaffte es trotzdem in den Dax. Im Jahr 2019 deckt ein Bericht der britischen Zeitung \\'Financial Times\\' Unregelmäßigkeiten bei Geschäften in Singapur auf. Nach einigem Hin und Her kam 2020 der jähe Absturz des Unternehmens, als klar wurde, dass auf Treuhandkonten 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlen. CEO Markus Braun trat zurück und wurde festgenommen, während Vorstandsmitglied Jan Marsalek unter einem Vorwand das Land verließ und die Flucht ergriff. Am 25. Juni 2020 meldete der Dax-Konzern Insolvenz an. Es stellte sich heraus, dass wesentliche Teile des Geschäfts tatsächlich nie stattgefunden hatten. Der damalige Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz geriet unter Druck, weil die ihm unterstellte Bafin trotz aller Hinweise wenig gegen den Zahlungsdienstleister unternommen hatte. 2022 begann der Strafprozess gegen Markus Braun, Oliver Bellenhaus und den ehemaligen Wirecard-Chefbuchhalter. Sie sind angeklagt wegen Marktmanipulation, Untreue, falscher Darstellung und gewerbsmäßigen Bandenbetrugs. Marsalek wäre sicherlich mit auf der Anklagebank, ist aber bis heute flüchtig und wird mit internationalem Haftbefehl gesucht. Im Juli 2023 meldete er sich mit einem Brief beim Landgericht München, welcher Braun entlasten sollte. Zeugenaussagen zeichneten im Prozess das Bild eines Konzerns, in dem es chaotisch zuging und der Vorstand kein besonderes Interesse an der Rechtstreue zeigte. Auch die Firmenkultur ließ wohl zu wünschen übrig: \"Pornografie war ganz normal bei uns\", gab ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter der internen Revision im Zeugenstand zu Protokoll. Brauns Anwälte versuchten unterdessen mit 450 Beweisanträgen zu belegen, dass Marsalek und Kronzeuge Bellenhaus sowie zahlreiche Mittäter die Schuld tragen, während Braun ahnungslos war. Ob sie das Gericht überzeugen können? Aktuell zeichnet sich erstmal eine Verlängerung der Verhandlung ab. Für diesen filmreifen Skandal gibt es hier im Ranking Platz 2. #### Platz 1: Cum-Ex-Skandal – Größter Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Die kriminelle Energie deutscher Banken und ihrer Anleger kennt keine Grenzen. Mit „Cum-Ex“- und „Cum-Cum“-Wertpapiertransaktionen zwischen mehreren Anlegern rundum den Dividendenstichtag einer Aktie verwirrten die Kreditinstitute von 2005 bis 2011 gezielt den Fiskus. So sehr, dass Finanzbeamte am Schluss nicht mehr erkennen konnten, welcher Bankkunde auf die Ausschüttung Kapitalertragsteuer gezahlt hatte, und welcher nicht. So konnten sich auch Anleger die Steuer zurückerstatten lassen, die sie gar nicht bezahlt hatten. Insgesamt prellten Banken und Aktionäre den deutschen Steuerzahler so um bis zu 32 Milliarden Euro – der größte Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik. *Überarbeitet von Julia Dusold und Dagmar Merger (14.08.2023)* ## Sie möchten gerne weiterlesen? ### Jetzt kostenlos registrieren oder einloggen: Newsletter-Anmeldung Bleiben Sie zu allen Themen, Trends und Innovationen der Branche informiert. ## Auch interessant ## Aktuelle Beiträge [Wirtschaft](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft.html) 15.

Il est essentiel que les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière en comprennent les subtilités. ### Définition et principes de base du blanchiment d’argent Le blanchiment d’argent est le processus qui consiste à faire paraître légal le produit de l’argent illégal. Il s’agit d’une méthode utilisée par les criminels pour dissimuler leurs activités et l’argent en jeu, en faisant apparaître le produit de leurs crimes comme légitime. Cela se fait souvent par le biais d’une séquence complexe de virements bancaires ou de transactions commerciales, ce qui rend difficile le traçage de la source d’origine des fonds. Parmi les exemples bien documentés de blanchiment d’argent, citons l’utilisation d’espèces pour acheter des polices d’assurance-vie et les laisser ensuite expirer, l’achat et la vente d’actifs de valeur comme des œuvres d’art, et l’utilisation de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) pour dissimuler la propriété et le transfert de fonds, en particulier dans le secteur immobilier. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services dans le [cadre du blanchiment d’argent axé sur le commerce](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce\") et l’utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) sont également des méthodes courantes utilisées pour blanchir de l’argent. ### Les étapes du blanchiment d’argent Comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) est crucial pour détecter et prévenir cette activité illicite. Ces étapes comprennent généralement le placement, la superposition et l’intégration. **Placement** : Il s’agit du processus d’introduction de l’argent illicite dans le système financier. Cela peut être fait en divisant de grandes quantités d’argent en petites sommes moins visibles qui sont ensuite déposées directement dans un compte bancaire, ou en achetant une série d’instruments (tels que des chèques ou des mandats) qui sont ensuite collectés et déposés dans des comptes à un autre endroit. **Superposition** : À ce stade, le blanchisseur d’argent s’engage généralement dans une série de conversions ou de mouvements des fonds pour les éloigner de leur source. La superposition peut consister en plusieurs virements bancaires, des virements bancaires entre différents comptes à des noms différents dans différents pays, des dépôts et des retraits pour faire varier continuellement le montant d’argent sur les comptes, changer la devise de l’argent et acheter des articles de grande valeur (tels que des maisons ou des entreprises) pour changer la forme de l’argent. C’est ce qu’on appelle parfois [la superposition complexe](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). **Intégration** : La dernière étape du processus. Au [stade de l’intégration](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/), l’argent réintègre l’économie traditionnelle sous une forme d’apparence légitime – il semble provenir d’une transaction légale. Il peut s’agir d’un virement bancaire final sur le compte d’une entreprise locale dans laquelle le blanchisseur « investit » en échange d’une part des bénéfices, de la vente d’une propriété achetée pendant la phase de superposition ou simplement de la dépense d’argent qui a été blanchi pour des produits de luxe. En comprenant les bases du blanchiment d’argent et ses étapes, les professionnels peuvent mieux s’outiller pour détecter et prévenir ces activités, qui sont des aspects cruciaux de la [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ## Regarder des exemples concrets Pour mieux comprendre la dynamique du blanchiment d’argent, penchons-nous sur des exemples concrets. Ces affaires, impliquant l’assurance-vie, le monde de l’art et les sociétés écrans dans l’immobilier, dévoilent les stratégies complexes employées pour dissimuler des fonds illicites. ### Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’assurance-vie L’une des méthodes de blanchiment d’argent consiste à souscrire des polices d’assurance-vie. Les particuliers utilisent de l’argent comptant pour acheter ces polices, puis empruntent sur celles-ci et finissent par laisser les polices expirer. Cette méthode circulaire obscurcit l’origine des fonds et donne un vernis de légitimité à l’argent illicite ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Cet exemple souligne l’importance des procédures de [connaissance du client (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) et de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle dans le secteur de l’assurance en tant qu’éléments clés de [la conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ### Le blanchiment d’argent dans le monde de l’art Le monde de l’art est un autre domaine vulnérable au blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent et vendent des œuvres d’art de valeur pour masquer l’origine de l’argent utilisé dans ces transactions. La valeur élevée des œuvres d’art, associée à la nature subjective de leur prix, en fait un terrain fertile pour les stratagèmes de blanchiment d’argent. Cela met en évidence la nécessité de contrôles rigoureux et de transparence dans les transactions d’œuvres d’art de grande valeur. ### Sociétés fictives et biens immobiliers Les transactions immobilières, en particulier celles impliquant [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), sont un autre canal courant de blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent souvent des biens immobiliers en utilisant de l’argent comptant et dissimulent leur propriété par le biais de sociétés fictives ou de propriétés cachées afin d’obscurcir la piste des fonds et de compliquer la recherche de leurs origines illicites ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dans certains cas, les évaluations immobilières sont manipulées et les criminels collaborent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette pratique illicite leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Dans un cas notable, un Hondurien a blanchi plus d’un million de dollars de pots-de-vin par virement bancaire international pour acheter des propriétés à la Nouvelle-Orléans, y compris des espaces de bureaux ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Dans un autre cas, une banque privée aurait permis à un compte appartenant au Vatican de dépenser 350 millions de dollars pour investir dans l’immobilier londonien, facilitant ainsi les transactions immobilières illégales, y compris celles effectuées par des trafiquants de drogue pour acheter des propriétés en Bulgarie ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Ces exemples illustrent l’importance de la transparence des [bénéficiaires effectifs](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans les transactions immobilières et la nécessité de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur. Ils soulignent également les défis auxquels sont confrontés les organismes chargés de l’application de la loi pour retracer les flux de fonds illicites et le rôle central des [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) dans les systèmes de blanchiment d’argent. ## Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce est une forme complexe de criminalité financière qui utilise des transactions commerciales pour cacher, déplacer et investir de l’argent gagné illicitement. C’est l’une des trois méthodes fondamentales de blanchiment d’argent, avec la superposition et l’intégration, qui peuvent toutes être explorées dans notre article sur les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/). ### Fausse déclaration de biens ou de services Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce consiste à faire de fausses déclarations sur le prix, la quantité ou la qualité de biens ou de services afin de transférer de la valeur entre les pays et de dissimuler la source illicite des fonds ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Cette méthode peut être utilisée à la fois à [l’étape de la stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour créer des couches complexes de transactions et à [l’étape d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour réintroduire l’argent blanchi dans l’économie légitime. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services peut prendre plusieurs formes, telles que la surfacturation, la sous-facturation, la facturation multiple ou la description mensongère de biens ou de services. Ces pratiques frauduleuses sont souvent facilitées par [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) et des structures de [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dissimulées, ce qui peut rendre difficile pour les autorités de détecter ces activités et d’enquêter sur celles-ci. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent lié au commerce Un exemple notable de blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce concerne une organisation criminelle qui utilise des biens sous-évalués et de fausses factures pour blanchir 1,8 million de dollars d’argent sale ([ONUDC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). Dans ce cas, l’organisation a acheté des biens dans un pays à bas prix, puis les a vendus dans un autre pays à un prix beaucoup plus élevé. La différence de prix a été utilisée pour blanchir l’argent illicite. Cette affaire nous rappelle brutalement l’importance de solides procédures de [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) , y compris une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard de la clientèle et une surveillance continue des transactions. En comprenant les techniques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce, les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux identifier et [atténuer les risques](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Atténuer les risques\") associés à ce type d’activité illicite. Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent mettent en évidence la nécessité d’une vigilance continue et de contrôles efficaces dans le secteur du commerce mondial. Alors que les méthodes utilisées par les criminels continuent d’évoluer, il est crucial pour les organisations de rester informées et d’adapter leurs stratégies [de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent\") en conséquence. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent, les professionnels peuvent mieux protéger leurs organisations et contribuer à la lutte mondiale contre la criminalité financière. ## Utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires Les entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) jouent un rôle crucial dans le système financier mondial, offrant des services tels que le transfert d’argent, le change de devises et l’encaissement de chèques. Cependant, l’utilisation abusive des ESM est devenue une préoccupation importante dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, car ces entreprises peuvent faciliter le mouvement de fonds sans examen ou surveillance réglementaire appropriés ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Transmetteurs d’argent non enregistrés Dans le contexte du blanchiment d’argent, les criminels exploitent souvent des émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés, un sous-ensemble d’ESM, pour transférer des fonds illicites sans attirer l’attention des autorités ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces entités non enregistrées opèrent sous le radar, contournant les réglementations strictes et les procédures de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle auxquelles les institutions financières traditionnelles sont soumises. Les transferts effectués par l’intermédiaire de ces ESM non inscrites peuvent ne pas laisser de traces, ce qui rend difficile la reconstitution de la source d’origine ou de la destination finale des fonds. Cela en fait un canal idéal pendant la [phase de stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/), où l’objectif est de dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites. La relative facilité et l’anonymat offerts par les émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés les rendent attrayants pour les criminels, qui utilisent ces services pour transférer de l’argent au-delà des frontières sans être détectés. Il s’agit d’un défi de taille pour les efforts [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le monde entier. ### Études de cas d’utilisation abusive d’ESM L’utilisation abusive des ESM n’est malheureusement pas rare, avec de nombreux cas enregistrés à travers le monde. Par exemple, les criminels sont connus pour utiliser les ESM pour blanchir de l’argent provenant d’activités illégales telles que le trafic de drogue, la fraude et le crime organisé. Dans de nombreux cas, ces fonds illicites transitent par des ESM non enregistrées, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de détecter et de retracer les transactions. L’utilisation abusive des ESM est un rappel brutal de l’importance d’une surveillance réglementaire rigoureuse dans le secteur financier. Il souligne la nécessité de mettre en place des procédures efficaces de [connaissance du client (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) un suivi rigoureux des transactions et une diligence raisonnable approfondie pour prévenir de tels abus. La lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent est continue, avec de nouvelles méthodes et techniques qui émergent constamment. En comprenant et en tirant des leçons de ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/), les organismes de réglementation, les responsables de la conformité et les institutions financières peuvent mieux s’équiper pour détecter et prévenir les flux d’argent illicites à l’avenir. ## Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’immobilier Les transactions immobilières offrent aux criminels un moyen efficace de blanchir des fonds illicites. Les transactions de grande valeur du secteur, combinées aux montages juridiques et financiers souvent complexes qu’elles impliquent, représentent une opportunité intéressante pour les criminels qui cherchent à légitimer leurs gains mal acquis. ### Achat et vente d’une propriété Une méthode courante employée par les criminels consiste à acheter des biens immobiliers en espèces, puis à dissimuler leur propriété par le biais de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) ou de propriétés cachées ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Cette méthode obscurcit la piste des fonds et complique la recherche de leurs origines illicites, ce qui pose des défis aux organismes d’application de la loi. Une autre stratégie consiste à manipuler les évaluations immobilières. Les criminels collaborent souvent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette tactique leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Les criminels établissent également des sociétés fictives dans des juridictions étrangères pour posséder des biens immobiliers, ce qui facilite le mouvement transfrontalier de fonds illicites. Cette méthode rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux de fonds, ce qui démontre une méthode utilisée pour dissimuler des activités de blanchiment d’argent. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent immobilier Le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur immobilier est un problème mondial. Selon un rapport de Global Financial Integrity (GFI), plus de 2,3 milliards de dollars ont été blanchis dans l’immobilier américain entre 2015 et 2021. Cela montre à quel point l’immobilier reste l’un des moyens les plus populaires de transférer des fonds illicites. Autre exemple, au cours de la dernière décennie, environ 20 milliards de dollars sont entrés sur le marché immobilier dans la région du Grand Toronto au Canada sans que les autorités de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ne fassent l’objet [d’un examen minutieux (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Région | Quantité blanchie (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | États-Unis | 2,3 milliards de dollars | | Grand Toronto, Canada | 20 milliards de dollars | Ces exemples soulignent l’importance de la vigilance et de la conformité efficace en [matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le secteur immobilier. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées par les criminels et en étant conscients des [signaux d’alarme](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Signaux d’alarme\"), les professionnels du secteur immobilier peuvent jouer un rôle essentiel dans la perturbation de ces flux financiers illicites. Pour ceux qui travaillent dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière, comprendre ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) peut aider à identifier les risques potentiels et à mettre en œuvre des procédures efficaces [de diligence raisonnable à l’égard de la clientèle](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) . ## Scandales de blanchiment d’argent Même avec la mise en place de mesures strictes [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) et de contrôles réglementaires, des cas de blanchiment d’argent à grande échelle continuent de faire surface. Examinons quelques scandales notables de blanchiment d’argent qui ont fait la une des journaux ces dernières années. ### La fuite des fichiers FinCEN En 2020, la fuite des FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) Files a révélé un vaste réseau de corruption financière. Plus de 400 journalistes de 88 pays ont collaboré à cette enquête, découvrant un montant stupéfiant de 2 000 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes. Ces fichiers secrets contenaient des informations sur des transactions signalées comme suspectes par les banques, mais qui ont été autorisées à se poursuivre. Le rapport a mis en évidence de graves défaillances dans les systèmes bancaires mondiaux, permettant de transférer d’importantes sommes d’argent sans contrôles adéquats. La fuite des FinCEN Files a souligné l’importance d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et d’une application rigoureuse des réglementations [KYC (Know Your Customer).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) L’affaire est un rappel brutal de l’ampleur et de la complexité potentielles des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. ### La fuite des Panama Papers La fuite des Panama Papers en 2016 a été une révélation monumentale qui a révélé de nombreux cas très médiatisés de blanchiment d’argent, d’évasion fiscale et de contournement des sanctions internationales. La fuite a impliqué des banques, des cabinets d’avocats et des personnalités de premier plan dans le monde entier, révélant l’étendue des activités financières illicites dissimulées par le biais de [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) et de [sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/). Les Panama Papers ont mis en évidence l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives anonymes pour dissimuler la [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/), une tactique courante dans la [phase de superposition du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). En conséquence, le scandale a suscité des appels à une plus grande transparence dans les services financiers offshore et à une réglementation plus stricte pour identifier les bénéficiaires effectifs. ### Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka Le scandale de la « Troïka Laundromat » a impliqué le blanchiment de 4,6 milliards de dollars par le biais d’un réseau de fausses entreprises et de transactions financières illicites entre 2006 et 2013. Ce stratagème a impliqué de multiples parties dans différentes juridictions, ce qui montre la portée mondiale des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka a mis en lumière l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives pour dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites, une tactique courante dans la [phase d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/). Le scandale a donné lieu à des enquêtes et à des actions en justice, soulignant davantage l’importance de la coopération mondiale dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. Chacun de ces scandales souligne l’importance de mesures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et la nécessité constante de faire preuve de vigilance et d’application de la loi. En étudiant ces « exemples de blanchiment d’argent », les professionnels de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux comprendre les tactiques employées par les blanchisseurs d’argent et la façon de détecter et de prévenir ces activités illicites. ## Tirer les leçons des affaires de blanchiment d’argent Comprendre des scénarios du monde réel est l’un des moyens les plus efficaces de comprendre le processus complexe du blanchiment d’argent. Cette section examine de plus près certains des exemples de blanchiment d’argent les plus significatifs de l’histoire récente afin de fournir des informations précieuses sur la façon dont ces événements se sont déroulés et les leçons apprises. ### L’affaire Wachovia Bank En 2010, la Wachovia Bank a été impliquée dans une importante opération de blanchiment d’argent impliquant des cartels de la drogue mexicains. Entre 2004 et 2007, la banque a facilité le blanchiment de près de 390 milliards de dollars par l’intermédiaire de ses succursales. Les fonds illicites, glanés lors de la vente de drogue aux États-Unis, ont été passés en contrebande à travers la frontière mexicaine et ont ensuite été retournés sur les comptes américains de Wachovia. La banque n’a pas vérifié l’origine de ces fonds, manquant ainsi à ses obligations en matière de [connaissance du client (KYC).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) Au lieu de poursuites, Wachovia a payé une amende de 160 millions de dollars et s’est engagé à améliorer ses [procédures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AML).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) ### L’affaire de la Standard Chartered Bank La Standard Chartered Bank s’est heurtée à de lourdes sanctions pour des violations répétées des sanctions américaines. Initialement condamnée à une amende de 670 millions de dollars en 2012 pour des violations impliquant l’Iran, la banque a de nouveau été accusée en 2019 d’ignorer les sanctions contre des pays tels que le Zimbabwe, la Birmanie, l’Iran, le Soudan, Cuba et la Syrie. Pour ces infractions, les autorités américaines et britanniques ont infligé à Standard Chartered une amende totale de 1,1 milliard de dollars, soulignant les graves conséquences du non-respect du droit international. ### L’affaire Danske Bank La succursale estonienne de Danske Bank a servi d’intermédiaire pour environ 228 milliards de dollars de fonds blanchis entre 2007 et 2015. Ce scandale, impliquant des milliers de clients suspects, a attiré l’attention du public sur les manquements de la banque en matière de conformité. Les autorités danoises ont infligé des amendes d’un montant total de 2 millions de dollars et ont attribué la faute à plusieurs responsables de la banque. ### L’affaire BCCI La Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) s’est livrée à des activités de fraude et de [blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) totalisant jusqu’à 23 milliards de dollars américains. La BCCI a utilisé des stratagèmes sophistiqués de blanchiment d’argent tels que [des sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), des paradis fiscaux, des commissions et des pots-de-vin. La fermeture de la banque en 1991 a donné lieu à de nombreuses actions en justice, notamment la poursuite de la Banque d’Angleterre par la BCCI pour négligence dans l’identification des signes avant-coureurs. Cette affaire met en évidence l’importance de solides programmes de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment [d’argent (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent soulignent l’importance de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et de la nécessité de comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) pour détecter et dissuader la criminalité financière.

Juli 2024 - 22 Minuten Lesezeit **[Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/wie-funktioniert-geldwaesche/)** – ein Begriff, der längst nicht nur in Kriminalromanen auftaucht, sondern reale und tiefgreifende Konsequenzen für Wirtschaftssysteme weltweit darstellt. Insbesondere **Deutschland** hat sich, vielleicht unerwartet für viele, zu einem wahren Hotspot bzw. **Geldwäscheparadies** entwickelt. In diesem Artikel widmen wir uns den zentralen Fragen: **Warum** ist Deutschland zu einem Eldorado für Geldwäsche avanciert? **Wie** schneidet die Bundesrepublik im europäischen Vergleich ab, und **welche** **Folgen** hat das Geldwäscheparadies Deutschland für die Wirtschaft und den Finanzsektor? Die Antworten auf diese Fragen sind vielschichtig und führen uns in die Tiefen des internationalen Finanzwesens, zu Schwachstellen in nationalen Rechtssystemen und den politischen wie ökonomischen Dynamiken, die Deutschland in dieser Rolle festigen. Wir betrachten die **Hintergründe**, die strukturellen Probleme und die Verstrickungen, die Deutschland zur Zieladresse für schmutziges Geld machen. Zudem stellen wir die **Strategien und Maßnahmen** vor, die auf nationaler und europäischer Ebene ergriffen werden, um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzuwirken und zeigen auf, **welche Schritte** noch notwendig sind, um effektive Kontrollmechanismen zu etablieren. Inhalt [Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788086) [Europäischer Vergleich](#t-1722253788087) [Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788088) [Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788089) ## Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### Gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen Deutschland verfügt über **umfangreiche gesetzliche Bestimmungen** zur Bekämpfung der [Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/phasen-der-geldwaesche/), darunter das [Geldwäschegesetz (GwG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/), die [6 Geldwäscherichtlinien](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) sowie [§ 261 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__261.html). Trotz dieser Regulatorien gibt es Schwächen in der Umsetzung. Die Verfolgung von Geldwäschefällen hängt stark von der **Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Behörden** wie Polizei, Finanzbehörden und der Justiz ab. Eine häufige Kritik ist, dass es zu lange dauert, bis verdächtige Aktivitäten untersucht und rechtlich verfolgt werden. Zudem fehlen oft klare Vorgaben für die präventive Eindämmung illegaler Vermögensumwandlung in bestimmten Branchen, wie z.B. im Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel. ### Finanzaufsicht und Kontrolle Die [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/pflicht-zur-bestellung-eines-geldwaeschebeauftragten/) in Deutschland steht zunehmend in der Kritik, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die **Zuständigkeiten und die Effizienz der Aufsichtsbehörden**. Während die **Bundesanstalt für Finanz-dienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin)**für den Finanzsektor zuständig ist, liegen die Aufsichtspflichten für andere Bereiche wie z.B. Autohäuser, Immobilienmakler, Juweliere etc. bei den lokalen Aufsichtsbehörden. Dieses System führt zu einem **\"Flickenteppich\"** an undurchsichtigen Zuständigkeiten, was die Wirksamkeit der Geldwäschebekämpfung erheblich beeinträchtigt. Zusätzlich sorgt die **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)**, die zentrale Meldestelle für Verdachtsmeldungen, für massive Kritik. Der FIU wird Fach- und Knowhow-Mangel sowie ein erheblicher Personalmangel vorgeworfen. Dies führt dazu, dass viele Verdachtsmeldungen nicht zeitnah bearbeitet werden können. Die ineffiziente Struktur und mangelnde Ressourcen der FIU schwächen die Geldwäscheprävention und lassen Kriminellen zu viel Spielraum. ### Banken und Finanzdienstleister **Banken und andere Finanzinstitute** sind **Schlüsselakteure** im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Sie sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, Verdachtsmeldungen über fragwürdige Transaktionen abzugeben und interne Kontrollen zur Prävention von Finanzwäsche durchzuführen. Dennoch gibt es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Banken ihrer **Sorgfaltspflicht** nicht nachkommen. Ursachen hierfür sind oft unzureichende interne Kontrollen, mangelnde Schulung des Personals oder bewusstes Ignorieren von Vorschriften. Große Banken sind häufig in Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, was zeigt, dass trotz bestehender Regelungen die praktische Umsetzung mangelhaft ist. ### Hohe Bargeldnutzung Deutschland hat traditionell eine **hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen**. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. Dies führt zu mehreren spezifischen Schwächen: #### **Anonymität der Transaktionen** * Bargeldtransaktionen sind anonym und hinterlassen keine digitalen Spuren, was es den Strafverfolgungsbehörden erschwert, die Herkunft und den Fluss der Gelder nachzuverfolgen. Dies macht Bargeld zu einem bevorzugten Mittel für Kriminelle, die illegale Gelder waschen möchten. #### ****Mangelnde Transparenz**** * Große Bargeldtransaktionen sind weniger transparent als elektronische Transaktionen. Selbst wenn solche Transaktionen gemeldet werden müssen, ist es schwieriger, verdächtige Muster zu erkennen und zu analysieren. Dies führt zu Lücken in der Prüfung und Erkennung von Geldwäscheaktivitäten. #### ******Erschwerte Durchsetzung von Gesetzen****** * Die hohen Bargeldnutzungsraten erschweren die Durchsetzung von Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetzen. Während Banken und andere Finanzinstitute strengen Regulierungen und Meldepflichten unterliegen, sind Bargeldtransaktionen oft weniger reguliert, insbesondere wenn sie außerhalb formaler Finanzinstitute stattfinden. ### Kritische Sektoren: ### ### Immobilien, Kunst- und Auktionshäuser, Autohäuser Bestimmte [Sektoren](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/warnung-vor-neuer-betrugsmasche-fuer-gwg-relevante-haendler/) sind besonders anfällig für Geldwäsche, darunter der **Immobiliensektor, Kunst-** und **Auktionshäuser** sowie **Autohäuser**. Diese Sektoren bieten aufgrund hoher Transaktionssummen und oftmals unzureichender Überwachung ideale Bedingungen für die Umwandlung illegaler Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte. #### **Immobiliensektor** Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt ist besonders anfällig für \"schmutziges\" Geld. **Große Bargeldtransaktionen** und **komplexe Eigentumsstrukturen** machen es schwierig, die Herkunft von Geldern nachzuverfolgen. In Städten wie Berlin, Hamburg und München wird der Immobilienmarkt oft genutzt, um Schwarzgeld zu waschen. Der Erwerb von Luxusimmobilien oder die Investition in Bauprojekte sind gängige Methoden, um illegale Gelder in den legalen Wirtschaftskreislauf einzuschleusen. Seit dem **1. April 2023** gibt es zwar in Deutschland ein **Bargeldverbot beim Immobilienkauf (**[**§ 59 Abs. 11 GwG**](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/__59.html)**)**, um die Finanzwäsche einzudämmen, dennoch bleibt die Umsetzung und Überwachung dieser Regelungen eine Herausforderung. #### **Kunst- und Auktionshäuser** Der Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel ist ein weiterer Sektor, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Hier **fehlen oft klare Vorgaben und Meldepflichten**, die eine wirksame Überwachung und Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen ermöglichen würden. Es gibt **keine** flächendeckende, verpflichtende **Registrierung** **und Lizenzierung** von Kunst- und Antiquitätenhändlern, was die systematische Überwachung erschwert. Für **Transaktionen über 10.000 Euro** bestehen jedoch **Meldepflichten**, die häufig nicht konsequent umgesetzt werden. Kunsthändler und Auktionshäuser sind verpflichtet, bei hochpreisigen Transaktionen die Herkunft der Gelder und die Identität der Käufer umfassend zu überprüfen und zu dokumentieren. #### **Autohäuser** Autohäuser sind ebenfalls ein kritischer Sektor, da hier **hohe Summen in bar** bezahlt werden können, um illegale Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte umzuwandeln. In Deutschland gilt eine **Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro für Fahrzeugkäufe**. Transaktionen, die diesen Betrag überschreiten, müssen dokumentiert und die am Kauf Beteiligten müssen identifiziert werden. Trotz dieser Regelungen gibt es oft Lücken in der Überwachung und Durchsetzung, was die Kontrolle und Dokumentation solcher Transaktionen erschwert. ### Unternehmen und Steueroasen Viele Unternehmen nutzen **komplexe Firmenstrukturen**, darunter auch Briefkastenfirmen bzw. allgemein Offshore-Konstrukte, um Geldwäsche zu betreiben. **Offshore-Konstrukte** sind rechtliche und finanzielle Strukturen, die in Ländern oder Gebieten mit günstigen Steuer- und Regulierungsgesetzen (z.B. Bulgarien, Luxemburg, Schweiz, Malta...) eingerichtet werden. Diese Gebiete werden oft als Steueroasen bezeichnet. Solche Konstrukte beinhalten häufig die **Gründung von****Briefkastenfirmen oder Tochtergesellschaften**, die hauptsächlich dazu dienen, steuerliche Vorteile zu nutzen und die Herkunft von Geldern zu verschleiern. Diese Strukturen erschweren die Nachverfolgung illegaler Gelder erheblich. Deutschland hat zwar Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Nutzung solcher Konstrukte zu bekämpfen, jedoch bleiben internationale Verflechtungen ein großes Hindernis. Steueroasen bieten weiterhin **Schlupflöcher für Unternehmen**, die illegale Gelder verstecken oder waschen möchten. Die Transparenz und Offenlegung von Unternehmensstrukturen ist daher ein zentraler Punkt im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Um Geldwäsche in Deutschland effektiv zu bekämpfen, müssen die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen kontinuierlich verbessert werden. Eine stärkere internationale Zusammenarbeit und gezielte Maßnahmen zur Überwachung der kritischen Branchen und der Finanzinstitute sind unerlässlich. Nur durch eine umfassende und koordinierte Strategie kann die Geldwäsche nachhaltig eingedämmt werden. **Schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen vor **Geldwäsche-Risiken**!** Fordern Sie noch heute Ihre kostenlose Erstberatung an und profitieren Sie von unserer langjährigen Expertise im Bereich der Geldwäscheprävention. [Jetzt Beratungsgespräch sichern](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/anfrage/) ## Europäischer Vergleich Die **Gesetzgebung** zur Bannung der Geldwäsche **variiert in Europa erheblich**. Während einige Länder strenge Regulierungen und effektive Durchsetzungsmechanismen implementiert haben, stehen andere noch vor massiven Herausforderungen. In diesem Abschnitt vergleichen wir die Ansätze mehrerer europäischer Länder und analysieren, wie **Deutschland im Vergleich** abschneidet. ### **Länder mit besonders zielführenden Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche** **Die Niederlande** gelten als Vorreiter in der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Sie haben ein zentrales Meldesystem für verdächtige Transaktionen, das von der Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-NL) verwaltet wird. Dieses System ermöglicht eine schnelle Erkennung und Verfolgung dubioser Aktivitäten. Die enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden trägt maßgeblich zum Erfolg bei. * Zentrales Meldesystem, enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden * Trotz strenger Regulierungen Probleme bei der Abwehr grenzüberschreitender Geldwäsche **Frankreich** hat ebenfalls umfangreiche Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung der Geldwäsche eingeführt. Die französische Finanzaufsichtsbehörde, Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), und Tracfin, eine spezielle Einheit zum Kampf gegen Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung, überwachen und regulieren Finanztransaktionen streng. Frankreich ist bekannt für seine konsequente Strafverfolgung und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von EU-Richtlinien zur Geldwäschereduzierung. * Strenge Kontrolle und konsequente Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinien * Komplikationen bei der Beaufsichtigung von [Kryptowährungen](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/kryptowaehrungen-und-geldwaeschepraevention/) und neuen Finanztechnologien **Das Vereinigte Königreich** hat einige der strengsten Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetze in Europa. Die National Crime Agency (NCA) und die Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) spielen eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Überwachung und Durchsetzung. Großbritannien hat strenge Meldepflichten und umfassende Maßnahmen zur Überprüfung und Verifizierung von Kundenidentitäten eingeführt. * Strenge Gesetze und rigorose Nachverfolgung durch NCA und FCA * London als globales Finanzzentrum bleibt Hotspot für Geldwäscheaktivitäten ### **Länder mit großen Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung** **Deutschland** hat, wie bereits oben erwähnt, in den letzten Jahren seine Gesetze zur Abwehr der Geldwäsche verschärft. Trotz dieser Fortschritte wird Deutschland oft kritisiert. Die FIU wird bzgl. Fach-, Knowhow- und Personalmangel bemängelt. Ebenso die Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) steht aufgrund begrenzter Ressourcen und komplexer Finanzströme vor einigen Hürden. Insbesondere in den bereits genannten Sektoren und bei der Beobachtung von Nichtfinanzunternehmen (\"Flickenteppich\") herrscht Ineffizienz der Behörden. Zudem hat Deutschland traditionell eine hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. * Umfassende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen * Ineffizienz der Behörden, Personalmangel, allg. hohe Bargeldnutzung Obwohl die **Schweiz** kein EU-Mitglied ist, spielt sie eine bedeutende Rolle im europäischen Finanzsystem. Die Schweiz hat in den letzten Jahren ihre Gesetze zum Widerstand gegen Geldwäsche verschärft und arbeitet eng mit internationalen Organisationen zusammen. Die Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA) überwacht Finanzinstitute und sorgt für die Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften. Die Schweiz bleibt jedoch aufgrund ihrer Bankgeheimnisse, attraktiven Steuerregelungen und ihrer sogenannten Zollfreigrenzen ein Hotspot für illegale Geldströme. * Enge Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen Organisationen und verschärfte Gesetze * Bankgeheimnis, attraktive Steuerregelungen und Zollfreigrenzen fördern Geldwäsche **Italien** hat mit erheblichen Hindernissen im Bereich der Geldwäsche zu kämpfen, insbesondere durch die Präsenz der Mafia und anderer krimineller Organisationen. Die italienische Regierung hat eine Vielzahl von Gesetzen und Regulierungen eingeführt, um Geldwäsche zu bekämpfen, darunter die Einrichtung der Anti-Mafia-Direktion (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, DIA). Trotz dieser Maßnahmen bleibt die konsequente Umsetzung ein ständiges Problem. * Einrichtung spezialisierter Anti-Mafia-Einheiten * Starke Präsenz der Mafia und ineffektive Umsetzung von Gesetzen ### **Fazit des Vergleichs** Ein Vergleich der europäischen Länder zeigt, dass **jedes Land gewisse Stärke und Schwächen** bei der Geldwäschebeseitigung aufweist, aber Staaten wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich und das Vereinigte Königreich** insgesamt **sehr erfolgreiche Maßnahmen** zur Geldwäscheneutralisierung implementiert haben. Diese Länder setzen auf enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Behörden und Finanzinstituten, strenge Regulierungen und beharrliche Strafverfolgung.Länder wie die **Schweiz und Italien** hingegen stehen hier vor **enormeren Stolpersteinen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter verbessern, um Geldwäsche entgegenzuwirken. **Deutschland** zeigt durch die stetige Verschärfung der gesetzlichen Regularien zwar einen **guten Ansatz**, muss jedoch ebenso seine Maßnahmen optimieren, insbesondere im Bereich der personellen Ausstattung und der Inspektion der kritischen Sektoren. ## Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche hat **erhebliche wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen für Deutschland**. Durch das Einfließen von illegalem Geld in die Wirtschaft werden Marktmechanismen verzerrt. Investitionen in Immobilien, Kunst und Luxusgüter mit illegalen Geldern können die Preise in diesen Märkten künstlich in die Höhe treiben. Dies kann zu einer Blase führen, die bei ihrem Platzen erhebliche **wirtschaftliche Schäden** verursachen kann. Außerdem **entgehen dem Staat** durch Geldwäsche **erhebliche Steuereinnahmen**, die sonst für öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Infrastrukturprojekte verwendet werden könnten. ### **Soziale und politische Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche **untergräbt das Vertrauen der Bürger in staatliche Institutionen und den Finanzsektor**. Wenn illegale Aktivitäten ungestraft bleiben, entsteht der Eindruck, dass Kriminalität nicht effektiv bekämpft wird und dass Gesetze nicht für alle gleichermaßen gelten. Dies kann zu sozialem Unmut und einem Rückgang der gesellschaftlichen Moral führen. Politisch kann dies Druck auf die Regierung ausüben, strengere Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, was wiederum die **politische Stabilität** beeinflussen kann. ### **Rechtliche Folgen** Die **rechtlichen Konsequenzen** illegaler Geldtransaktionen sind **weitreichend**. Individuen und Unternehmen, die der Geldwäsche überführt werden, sehen sich erheblichen Strafen gegenüber, einschließlich **hoher Geldstrafen** und **langjährigen Gefängnisstrafen**. Darüber hinaus können Unternehmen ihre **Geschäftslizenzen verlieren**, was ihre Fähigkeit, international zu operieren, stark einschränkt. Prominente Fälle zeigen, dass die Justiz zunehmend härter gegen Geldwäscher vorgeht. ### **Internationale Reputation** Geldwäsche hat auch starke **Auswirkungen auf die** **internationale Reputation Deutschlands**. Wenn ein Land als „Geldwäscheparadies“ angesehen wird, kann dies das **Vertrauen** **internationaler Investoren und Geschäftspartner****beeinträchtigen**. Internationale Organisationen wie die Financial Action Task Force (FATF) bewerten die Effektivität der Geldwäschebannung in verschiedenen Ländern. Negative Bewertungen können dazu führen, dass Deutschland **unter erhöhter Beobachtung** steht und möglicherweise **internationalen Druck** zur Verschärfung seiner Gesetze und Maßnahmen erfährt. Die Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind somit vielschichtig und betreffen verschiedene Bereiche der Gesellschaft. Wirtschaftliche Verzerrungen, sozialer und politischer Vertrauensverlust, rechtliche Strafen und die Beeinträchtigung der internationalen Reputation sind nur einige der gravierenden Auswirkungen. Um diesen negativen Folgen entgegenzuwirken, ist eine verstärkte und koordinierte Anstrengung zur Vorbeugung von Geldwäsche notwendig. ## Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Gesetzliche Reformen** Eine der wichtigsten Maßnahmen zur Entgegenwirkung der Geldwäsche ist die **kontinuierliche Verbesserung** der gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Deutschland hat diese bereits durch das GwG, die [GwG-Richtlinien](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/vierte-eu-geldwaescherichtlinie/) und den **§ 261 des StGBs verschärft**, aber es gibt weiterhin Raum für Verbesserungen. Regelmäßige **Überprüfungen und Anpassungen der Gesetze** sind notwendig, um auf neue Geldwäschemethoden zu reagieren. Zudem sollten härtere Strafen für Verstöße und eine bessere Ausstattung der Strafverfolgungsbehörden implementiert werden. #### **Ergänzung: EU-Gesetzespaket** Nach intensiven Verhandlungen und Abstimmungen wurde das [**AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**](https://www.hilfssheriff.de/eu-gesetzespaket-die-umsetzungsfrist-laeuft/) nun offiziell im Amtsblatt veröffentlicht. Dieses umfassende Regelwerk besteht aus drei wesentlichen und detaillierten Rechtsakten: **Die AMLA-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1620)** Die[**AMLA-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401620) etabliert die **neue EU-Behörde für die Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AMLA)**. Diese Behörde wird in Frankfurt am Main ansässig sein und **ab Mitte 2024** ihre Tätigkeit aufnehmen. Ihre Hauptaufgaben umfassen die direkte und indirekte Aufsicht über Verpflichtete im Finanzsektor, die einem hohen Risiko der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung ausgesetzt sind. **Die Geldwäsche-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1624)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401624) zielt darauf ab, die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für **Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung** zu verhindern. Sie tritt am **10. Juli 2027** in Kraft, mit spezifischen Ausnahmen für **Fußballagenten und Profifußballvereine**, die bis zum **10. Juli 2029** Zeit haben, die notwendigen Anpassungen vorzunehmen. **Einführung einer EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** Ein weiter wichtiger Bestandteil der **Geldwäsche-Verordnung** ist die **Einführung** einer **EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** in Höhe von **10.000 Euro**. Diese Regelung gilt für Barzahlungen zwischen Unternehmen sowie zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern, **nicht jedoch für Transaktionen zwischen Privatpersonen**. EU-Mitgliedstaaten haben die Option, eine niedrigere Obergrenze festzulegen. Die Regelung tritt voraussichtlich **Mitte 2026** in Kraft und stellt besonders für Länder wie Deutschland, die bisher keine Bargeldobergrenze hatten, eine bedeutende Änderung dar. In Deutschland existiert bisher keine generelle Obergrenze für Bargeldzahlungen. Allerdings muss sich der Käufer bei Bargeldzahlungen über 10.000 Euro ausweisen und die Herkunft des Geldes nachweisen. Der Händler ist verpflichtet, diese Informationen zu dokumentieren und aufzubewahren. **Die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie (Richtlinie (EU) 2024/1640)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Richtlinie**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401640) legt die **Mechanismen** fest, die von den Mitgliedstaaten zur Verhinderung der Nutzung des Finanzsystems für Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umgesetzt werden müssen. Sie **gilt nicht unmittelbar in den Mitgliedstaaten**, sondern muss in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden. Die Frist für die meisten Vorgaben ist der **10. Juli 2027**. Diese neuen Regelungen, einschließlich der Bargeldobergrenze, stellen einen bedeutenden Schritt in den Bemühungen der EU dar, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung effektiv zu bekämpfen und die Integrität des Finanzsystems zu gewährleisten. ### **Stärkung der Finanzaufsicht** Die **BaFin, FIU** bzw. allgemein die **deutschen Aufsichtsbehörden** spielen eine **zentrale Rolle** bei der **Beseitigung der Geldwäsche**. Um ihre Effektivität zu steigern, müssen die **personellen und technischen Ressourcen** sowie das **Fachwissen** erweitert werden. Dies umfasst z.B. die Einstellung zusätzlicher Experten und die Einführung moderner Analysetools zum Monitoring verdächtiger Transaktionen. Eine bessere internationale Zusammenarbeit und der Austausch von Informationen mit anderen Behörden können ebenfalls die Effizienz bei der Geldwäscheeindämmung erhöhen. ### **Technologische Lösungen** Zwar bringt der Einsatz von **Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI)** natürlich einerseits neue große Herausforderungen (z.B. gefälschte Ausweisdokumente, Deepfakes) mit sich, andererseits kann der **Einsatz moderner Technologie** die Geldwäscheeindämmung hingegen fördern. KI und maschinelles Lernen bieten **neue Möglichkeiten** zur **Erkennung und Analyse von Mustern**, die auf illegale Finanzströme hinweisen. Diese Technologien können große Datenmengen in Echtzeit überwachen und verdächtige Aktivitäten schneller und präziser identifizieren als herkömmliche Methoden. Darüber hinaus können **Blockchain-Technologien** zur Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen und zur Erhöhung der Transparenz im Finanzsektor beitragen. ### **Internationale Kooperation** Geldwäsche ist ein globales Problem, das eine internationale Zusammenarbeit erfordert. **Gemeinsame Initiativen** und der **Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices** sind entscheidend, um grenzüberschreitende Geldwäsche zielführend zu bekämpfen. Die Teilnahme an internationalen Taskforces und die Unterstützung globaler Standards zur [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaeschebeauftragter-aufgaben-rechte-pflichten-risiken/) sind von größter Wichtigkeit. Das bereits beschlossene **EU GwG-Paket**sowie die Schaffung einer **EU einheitlichen****zentralen Anti-Geldwäsche Behörde**stellt hier einen wichtigen Schritt bei der Entgegenwirkung illegaler Finanzabwicklungen dar. ### **Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Sensibilisierung** Ein oft vernachlässigter Aspekt der Geldwäscheabwehr ist die **Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit** und die Förderung eines besseren Verständnisses für die Risiken und Folgen von Geldwäsche. Durch gezielte **Aufklärungskampagnen** sowie [**(Mitarbeiter-)Schulungen**](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaesche-schulung-mitarbeiter/) können Bürger und Unternehmen über die Anzeichen und Meldemöglichkeiten von Geldwäsche informiert werden. Dies erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass verdächtige Aktivitäten erkannt und gemeldet werden. Diese Maßnahmen sind **zentrale Bausteine** einer erfolgreichen Strategie. Nur durch die Kombination dieser Ansätze kann Deutschland den Kraftakt der Geldwäschereduzierung meistern und seine Wirtschaft, Unternehmen sowie seine Verbraucher schützen. **Geldwäscheprävention** leicht gemacht: **Online-Schulung** für Ihr Team Unsere Online-Geldwäschepräventionsschulung bietet Mitarbeitern die Kenntnisse, die sie benötigen, um Geldwäsche zu erkennen und zu verhindern, gemäß den gesetzlichen Anforderungen.

[Jetzt Team anmelden](https://exkulpa.de/akademie/gwg-schulung-fuer-mitarbeiter/) ## Fallbeispiele Im Folgenden noch einige**Skandalbeispielfälle** von Geldwäsche, in die unter anderem **europäische Länder** verwickelt waren: ### **Fallbeispiel: Deutsche Bank** Die **Deutsche Bank** ist mehrfach wegen ihrer Verwicklung in Geldwäscheskandale in die Schlagzeilen geraten. Ein prominenter Fall ist die **Beteiligung** an einem riesigen Geldwäsche-Schema, das als **\"Russischer Spiegelhandel\"** bekannt ist. Zwischen 2011 und 2015 wurden über die Moskauer, Londoner und New Yorker Niederlassungen der Deutschen Bank etwa **10 Milliarden Dollar** gewaschen. Die Bank musste wegen unzureichender Kontrollmechanismen **Strafen** in Höhe von **630 Millionen Dollar** an die US- und britischen Behörden zahlen. ### **Fallbeispiel: Danske Bank** Die **Danske Bank** war in einen der **größten Geldwäscheskandale Europas** verwickelt. Über die estnische Niederlassung der Bank wurden zwischen 2007 und 2015 rund **200 Milliarden Euro** verdächtiger Gelder, hauptsächlich aus Russland, Aserbaidschan und der Ukraine, gewaschen. Der Skandal führte zu einem massiven Verlust an Vertrauen und einer erheblichen Belastung des Rufs der Bank. Die dänischen und estnischen Behörden sowie internationale Regulierungsbehörden führten umfassende Untersuchungen durch, was zu **hohen Geldstrafen und einem Rücktritt des CEO** führte. ### **Fallbeispiel: 1MDB-Skandal** Der **1MDB-Skandal** ist ein **globales Beispiel** für weitreichende Geldwäsche und Korruption. Der malaysische Staatsfonds 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) war in einen massiven Geldwäscheskandal verwickelt, bei dem **Milliarden von Dollar** durch ein komplexes Netzwerk von **Offshore-Konten und Scheinfirmen** gewaschen wurden. Banken in der Schweiz, Singapur und den USA waren beteiligt. In Deutschland spielte die Deutsche Bank erneut eine Rolle, indem sie Transaktionen im Zusammenhang mit 1MDB abgewickelt hat. Der Skandal führte zu **weltweiten Ermittlungen und zahlreichen Verhaftungen**. ### **Fallbeispiel: Wirecard** Der **Wirecard-Skandal** ist ein jüngeres Beispiel für umfassende Finanzkriminalität und Geldwäsche in Deutschland. Das Unternehmen Wirecard, ein Zahlungsdienstleister, war in betrügerische Aktivitäten verwickelt, bei denen angebliche Vermögenswerte in Höhe von **1,9 Milliarden Euro** fehlten. Die Geldwäscheaspekte des Skandals betreffen die komplexen internationalen Transaktionen und das Verschwinden großer Geldsummen durch **Briefkastenfirmen** in verschiedenen Ländern. Der Skandal führte zu einer **umfangreichen Untersuchung** durch deutsche und internationale Behörden und dem **Zusammenbruch des Unternehmens**. ### **Fallbeispiel: HSBC** Die **britische Bank HSBC** war in mehrere Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, darunter die Bereitstellung von Finanzdienstleistungen für Drogenkartelle in Mexiko und Kolumbien. Zwischen 2006 und 2010 wusch HSBC schätzungsweise **881 Millionen Dollar** an Drogengeldern. Die Bank gestand Versäumnisse bei der Geldwäscheprävention ein und zahlte **1,9 Milliarden Dollar an Strafen** im Rahmen eines Vergleichs mit den US-Behörden. Dieser Fall zeigte die globalen Dimensionen von Geldwäsche und die Notwendigkeit strengerer Kontrollen bei internationalen Banken. Diese Fallstudien verdeutlichen die **vielfältigen Methoden** und **enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche in Europa und weltweit**. Sie zeigen, wie leicht Finanzinstitute in illegale Aktivitäten verstrickt werden können und welche gravierenden Folgen dies für die beteiligten Unternehmen und die globale Wirtschaft hat. Durch die Untersuchung dieser Fälle können wichtige Lehren für die Verbesserung der Geldwäscheprävention und -bekämpfung gezogen werden. ## Fazit **Geldwäsche** bleibt ein **erhebliches Problem** in Deutschland und weltweit. Trotz bestehender Gesetze und Regulierungen gibt es zahlreiche Schwächen und Hürden bei der Gegenwehr. Die **Ursachen** für Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind vielfältig, darunter **gesetzliche Lücken**, **unzureichende Aufsicht**, die **Rolle von Banken und Finanzdienstleistern**, die **kritischen Sektoren** und die Nutzung **komplexer Firmenstrukturen** sowie **Steueroasen**. Ein **europäischer Vergleich** zeigt, dass Länder wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich** und **das** **Vereinigte Königreich** besonders **fruchtbare Maßnahmen** zur Eindämmung der Geldwäsche eingeführt haben. Im Gegensatz dazu stehen **Deutschland, die Schweiz** und **Italien**vor **umfangreicheren Komplikationen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter optimieren. Die **Konsequenzen** der Geldwäsche sind weitreichend, einschließlich **wirtschaftlicher Verzerrungen**, **sozialem** und **politischem Vertrauensverlust**, **rechtlichen Strafen** und **Beeinträchtigungen** der internationalen **Reputation**. Fallbeispiele wie die Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, 1MDB, Wirecard und HSBC illustrieren die vielfältigen Methoden und enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche. Die **Abwehr** der Geldwäsche erfordert **kontinuierliche Anpassungen und Verbesserungen**. Neue Technologien und komplexere Finanzströme stellen laufend neue Schwierigkeiten dar. Deutschland muss weiterhin seine gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen verbessern, um mit den sich wandelnden Methoden der Geldwäsche Schritt zu halten. Ein wichtiger Schritt in diese Richtung ist das kürzlich verabschiedete **AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**, das unter anderem eine **EU-weite Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro** einführt. Diese Maßnahme zielt darauf ab, die Transparenz bei größeren Finanztransaktionen zu erhöhen und die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für illegale Aktivitäten zu erschweren. Ein verstärkter Fokus auf die internationale Zusammenarbeit ist unerlässlich. Nur durch gemeinsame Anstrengungen und den Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices kann Geldwäsche konsequent entgegengewirkt werden. Die Integration **moderner Technologien** wie Künstlicher Intelligenz und **Blockchain** kann ebenfalls dazu beitragen, die Erkennung und Verfolgung von illegalen Finanzströmen zu verbessern.

It is estimated that 2- 5% of the global GDP or US$800 billion-US$2 trillion is being laundered every year across the globe. The lower range itself is a significant amount for the world to consider. For comparison, Saudi Arabia’s estimated nominal GDP is US$748 billion in 2018, ranking the country at 19 in the world. In order to combat money laundering, governments have formulated and implemented policies, and they have been successful in identifying more and more laundering activities and subsequently taking remedial measures. Here is an attempt to portray some of the biggest money laundering cases by the estimated size of money being laundered in recent times. The figures have been converted into US dollars in some cases for easier comparison. ## Commerzbank (US$347 million) The London branch of Commerzbank is the subject of one of the most severe fines in the UK. Commerzbank was facing a $50 million fine in June 2020. This German banking firm ignored several warnings from the cautious regulator and failed to adopt necessary know-your-customer laws affecting thousands of the bank’s customers. In 2016 and 2017, the bank failed to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-kickback laws. Due to a shortage of staff in the anti-money laundering department, Commerzbank employed 47 additional employees, bringing the total number of AML professionals in the department to 50. This helped the bank avoid future fines. Despite this, the bank failed to accommodate and offer necessary anti-money laundering (AML) protections. ## Westpac Bank (US$11 billion) With 19 million global transactions, this Australian financial service resolved with AUSTRAC in 2020 for AML concerns. They ended up paying one of the largest fines in history as a result of their efforts to avoid the regulations. Westpac skirted around several provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act of 2006. The banks’ ignorance of the law resulted in the penalties, which are believed to be worth over $11 billion. The banks’ ignorance was linked to offshore paedophile rings in Southeast Asia, prompting harsh reprimands. Because many of the transactions were linked to the network, the authorities investigated the settlement, which resulted in a $1.3 billion fine. ## Goldman Sachs (US$600 million) The world-famous Goldman Sachs was hit with the greatest fine in 2020. In the business’s 151-year history, the biggest fine ever issued in the US represented the first time the company had ever pleaded guilty to any financial violation. The Malaysian unit of Goldman Sachs was involved in the [1MBD scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/1mdb-scandal-explained-a-tale-of-malaysias-missing-billions), which had been in the works for more than ten years. [Bribery](/glossary/bribery), money laundering, and gross misuse of consumer funds were all committed by the company. After agreeing to pay a $2.5 billion fine, an additional $1.4 billion was fined in order to avoid prosecution by paying out 1MBD assets. ## Wachovia (US$390 billion) Now part of Wells Fargo, Wachovia was one of the biggest banks in the US. In 2010, the bank was found to have allowed drug cartels in Mexico to launder close to US$390 billion through its branches during 2004-2007. The drug cartels used to smuggle US dollars received from drug sales in the US across the Mexican border. Then, they used money exchangers to deposit the money into their bank accounts in Mexico, where regulatory requirements with regard to the source of funds were not on par with current standards. Later, the money was wired back to Wachovia’s accounts in the US, and the bank failed to check the origin of these funds. In addition, the drug cartels used Wachovia’s bulk cash service to ship back banknotes to the US. ## Standard Chartered (US$265 billion) The British banking giant in 2012 was accused by New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) of its failures in anti-money laundering controls that helped the Iranian government to circumvent US regulations to clean money to the tune of US$265 billion over a period of 10 years. In addition, the bank was accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Libya and Sudan. ## Danske Bank (US$228 billion) Denmark’s largest bank came into the limelight after the European Commission described its US$228 billion money laundering case as the biggest scandal in Europe. The bank’s Estonian branch allegedly had thousands of suspicious customers who made use of the bank’s weak controls to carry out illicit transactions worth about US$228 billion during 2007-2015. ## Nauru (US$70 billion) Nauru, once known for its tax-haven status with a large number of shell banks, helped Russian criminals launder an estimated US$70 billion in 1998. At that time, the island country in Micronesia, northeast of Australia, was allegedly allowing its banks to operate without properly identifying its customers and checking the source of deposits. ## BCCI (US$23 billion) From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and its customers were found to have committed fraud and money laundering activities totaling US$23 billion. BCCI was formed up purposefully to circumvent centralised regulatory supervision, according to investigators in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. To avoid regulatory inspection, the bank allegedly used a variety of complicated strategies, including shell firms, secrecy havens, kickbacks, and bribery. ## HSBC ($8 billion) In 2012, the bank was fined for having insufficient control measures, which permitted the laundering of an estimated $8 billion over a seven-year period. Provision of banking services and US dollars to some Saudi Arabian banks with apparent ties to terrorists, circumventing international sanctions and allowing transactions involving blacklisted countries such as Iran and North Korea. It also included improper controls at HSBC Mexico despite its apparent drug trafficking and money laundering problem was among the complaints levelled against the bank. For failing to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or know-your-customer regulations, all of the above-mentioned enterprises and financial institutions faced harsh penalties. Some of these financial institutions unwittingly participated in serious criminal behaviour and crimes by failing to pay attention to the protocols or deciding not to follow them. Other institutions can prevent these blunders by comprehending and implementing the established standards, ensuring that money laundering is not unintentionally carried out. Thus, they can avoid being part in money laundering cases. Advances in technology, particularly in financial services, have made it possible for criminals to move money around the world with ease. Launderers have been spotted devising complex ways to go beyond a government’s remedies. Banks have started realising the fact that their legacy rule-based systems cannot effectively mitigate risks related to money laundering. Now, they need to embrace advanced technology that can effectively solve their problems of getting involved in money laundering cases. Financial institutions can effectively make use of solutions based on machine learning, such as [Tookitaki’s AML Suite](/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), to counter money laundering cases.

A senior citizen in Navi Mumbai answered a number that appeared to belong to the police. Within hours, she was trapped on a video call with men in uniforms, accused of laundering money for terrorists. Terrified, she wired ₹21 lakh into what she believed was a government-controlled account. She was not alone. In August 2025, cases of “digital arrest” scams surged across India. An elderly couple in Madhya Pradesh drained nearly ₹50 lakh of their life savings after spending 13 days under constant video surveillance by fraudsters posing as investigators. In Rajkot, criminals used the pretext of a real anti-terror operation to extort money from a student. These scams are not crude phishing attempts. They are meticulously staged psychological operations, exploiting people’s deepest fears of authority and social disgrace. Victims are not tricked into handing over passwords. They are coerced, minute by minute, into making transfers themselves. The results are devastating, both for individuals and the wider financial system. ## Background of the Scam The anatomy of a digital arrest scam follows a chillingly consistent script. **1. The Call of Fear** Fraudsters begin with a phone call, often masked to resemble an official number. The caller claims the victim’s details have surfaced in a serious crime: drug trafficking, terror financing, or money laundering. The consequences are presented as immediate arrest, frozen accounts, or ruined reputations. **2. Escalation to Video** To heighten credibility, the fraudster insists on switching to a video call. Victims are connected to people wearing uniforms, holding forged identity cards, or even sitting before backdrops resembling police stations and courtrooms. **3. Isolation and Control** Once on video, the victim is told they cannot disconnect. In some cases, they are monitored round the clock, ordered not to use their phone for any purpose other than the call. Contact with family or friends is prohibited, under the guise of “confidential investigations.” **4. The Transfer of Funds** The victim is then directed to transfer money into so-called “secure accounts” to prove their innocence or pay bail. These accounts are controlled by criminals and serve as the first layer in complex laundering networks. Victims, believing they are cooperating with the law, empty fixed deposits, break retirement savings, and transfer sums that can take a lifetime to earn. The method blends social engineering with coercive control. It is not the theft of data, but the hijacking of human behaviour. ## What the Case Revealed The 2025 wave of digital arrest scams in India exposed three critical truths about modern fraud. **1. Video Calls Are No Longer a Guarantee of Authenticity** For years, people considered video more secure than phone calls or emails. If you could see someone’s face, the assumption was that they were genuine. These scams demolished that trust. Fraudsters showed that live video, like written messages, can be staged, manipulated, and weaponised. **2. Authority Bias is a Fraudster’s Greatest Weapon** Humans are hardwired to respect authority, especially law enforcement. By impersonating police or investigators, criminals bypass the victim’s critical reasoning. Fear of prison or social disgrace outweighs logical checks. **3. Coercion Multiplies the Damage** Unlike [phishing](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/phishing) or one-time deceptions, digital arrests involve prolonged psychological manipulation. Victims are kept online for days, bombarded with threats and false evidence. Under this pressure, even cautious individuals break down. The results are not minor losses, but catastrophic financial wipe-outs. **4. Organised Networks Are Behind the Scenes** The professionalism and scale suggest syndicates, not lone operators. From forged documents to layered mule accounts, the fraud points to criminal hubs capable of running scripted operations across borders. ## Impact on Financial Institutions and Corporates Though victims are individuals, the implications extend far into the financial and corporate world. **1. Reputational Risk** When victims lose life savings through accounts within the banking system, they often blame their bank as much as the fraudster. Even if technically blameless, institutions suffer a hit to public trust. **2. Pressure on Fraud Systems** Digital arrest scams exploit authorised transactions. Victims themselves make the transfers. Traditional detection tools that focus on unauthorised access or password breaches cannot easily flag these cases. **3. Global Movement of Funds** Money from scams rarely stays local. Transfers are routed across borders within hours, layered through mule accounts, e-wallets, and fintech platforms. This complicates recovery and exposes gaps in international coordination. **4. Corporate Vulnerability** The threat is not limited to retirees or individuals. In Singapore earlier this year, a finance director was tricked into wiring half a million dollars during a deepfake board call. Digital arrest tactics could just as easily target corporate employees handling high-value transactions. **5. Regulatory Expectations** As scams multiply, regulators are pressing institutions to demonstrate stronger customer protections, more resilient monitoring, and greater collaboration. Failure to act risks not only reputational damage but also regulatory penalties. ## Lessons Learned from the Scam **For Individuals** * Treat unsolicited calls from law enforcement with suspicion. Real investigations do not begin on the phone. * Verify independently by calling the published numbers of agencies. * Watch for signs of manipulation, such as demands for secrecy or threats of immediate arrest. * Educate vulnerable groups, particularly senior citizens, about how these scams operate. **For Corporates** * Train employees, especially those in finance roles, to recognise coercion tactics. * Require secondary verification for urgent, high-value transfers, especially when directed to new accounts. * Encourage a speak-up culture where staff can challenge suspicious instructions without fear of reprimand. **For Financial Institutions** * Monitor for mule account activity. Unexplained inflows followed by rapid withdrawals are a red flag. * Run customer awareness campaigns, explaining how digital arrest scams work. * Share intelligence with peers and regulators to prevent repeat incidents across institutions. ## The Role of Technology in Prevention Digital arrest scams prove that traditional safeguards are insufficient. Fraudsters are not stealing credentials but manipulating behaviour. Prevention requires smarter, adaptive systems. **1. Behavioural Monitoring** Transactions made under duress often differ from normal patterns. Advanced analytics can detect anomalies, such as sudden large transfers from accounts with low historical activity. **2. Typology-Driven Detection** Platforms like Tookitaki’s [FinCense](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) leverage the [AFC Ecosystem](https://www.afcecosystem.org) to encode real-world scam scenarios into detection logic. As digital arrest typologies are identified, they can be integrated quickly to improve monitoring. **3. AI-Powered Simulations** Institutions can run simulations of coercion-based scams to test whether their processes would withstand them. These exercises reveal gaps in escalation and verification controls. **4. Federated Learning for Collective Defence** With federated learning, insights from one bank can be shared across many without exposing sensitive data. If one institution sees a pattern in digital arrest cases, others can benefit almost instantly. **5. Smarter Alert Management** Agentic AI can review and narrate the context of alerts, allowing investigators to understand whether unusual activity stems from duress. This speeds up response times and prevents irreversible losses. ## Conclusion The digital arrest scam is not just a fraud. It is a form of psychological captivity, where victims are imprisoned through fear on their own devices. In 2025, India saw a surge of such cases, stripping people of their savings and shaking trust in digital communications. The message is clear: scams no longer rely on technical breaches. They rely on exploiting human trust. For individuals, the defence is awareness and verification. For corporates, it is embedding strong protocols and encouraging a culture of questioning. For financial institutions, the challenge is profound. They must detect authorised transfers made under coercion, collaborate across borders, and deploy AI-powered defences that learn as fast as the criminals do. If 2024 was the year of deepfake deception, 2025 is becoming the year of coercion-based fraud. The industry’s response will determine whether scams like digital arrests remain isolated tragedies or become a systemic crisis. Protecting trust is no longer optional. It is the frontline of financial crime prevention. Blogs 25 Aug 2025 5 min read ## Stablecoins Are Booming. Is Compliance Falling Behind? Programmable money isn’t a futuristic buzzword anymore — it’s here, and it’s scaling at breakneck speed. In 2024, stablecoin transactions exceeded $27 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. From international remittances to e-commerce, stablecoins are reshaping how money moves across borders. But there’s a catch: the same features that make stablecoins so powerful — speed, cost efficiency, accessibility — also make them attractive for financial crime. Instant, irreversible, and identity-light transactions have created a compliance challenge unlike any before. For regulators, banks, and fintechs, the question is clear: can compliance scale as fast as stablecoins? ## The Rise of Stablecoins: More Than Just Crypto Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar or euro. Unlike Bitcoin or Ether, they aren’t designed for volatility — they’re designed for utility. That’s why they’ve become the backbone of digital payments and decentralised finance (DeFi). * **Cross-border remittances**: Workers abroad can send money home cheaply and instantly. * **Trading and settlements**: Exchanges use stablecoins as liquidity anchors. * **Merchant adoption**: From small retailers to payment giants like PayPal (with its **PYUSD stablecoin** launched in 2023), stablecoin rails are entering mainstream commerce. With global players like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) dominating, and even central banks exploring CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), it’s clear stablecoins are no longer niche. They are programmable, scalable, and systemically important. But scale brings scrutiny. ## The Compliance Gap: Why Old Tools Don’t Work Most financial institutions still rely on compliance infrastructure designed decades ago for slower, linear payment systems. Batch settlements, SWIFT messages, and pre-clearing windows gave compliance teams time to check, flag, or stop suspicious activity. Stablecoins operate on entirely different principles: * **Real-time settlement**: Transactions confirm in seconds. * **Pseudonymous wallets**: No guaranteed link between a wallet and its true owner. * **DeFi composability**: Funds can move through multiple protocols, contracts, and blockchains with no central chokepoint. * **Irreversibility**: Once sent, funds can’t be clawed back. This creates an environment where bad actors can launder funds at the speed of code. Legacy compliance systems — built for yesterday’s risks — simply cannot keep up. ## The New Typologies Emerging on Stablecoin Rails Financial crime doesn’t stand still. It adapts to new rails faster than regulation or compliance can. Here are some typologies unique to stablecoins: 1. **Money Mule Networks** Organised groups recruit international students or gig workers to act as “cash-out points,” moving illicit funds through stablecoin wallets before converting back to fiat. 2. **Cross-Chain Laundering** Criminals exploit bridges between blockchains (e.g., Ethereum to Tron or Solana) to break traceability, making it harder to follow the money. This tactic was highlighted in multiple reports after North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered hundreds of millions in stolen crypto across chains. 3. **DeFi Layering** Funds are routed through decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, or automated market makers to mix flows and obscure origins. The U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash in 2022 marked a watershed moment, underscoring how DeFi mixers can become systemic laundering tools. 4. **Sanctions Evasion** With traditional banking rails restricted, sanctioned entities increasingly turn to stablecoins. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has flagged stablecoin usage in multiple enforcement actions tied to Russia and other high-risk jurisdictions. Each of these typologies highlights the speed, complexity, and opacity of stablecoin-based laundering. They don’t look like traditional fiat red flags — they demand new methods of detection. ## What Compliance Needs to Look Like for Stablecoins To match the speed of programmable money, compliance must itself become programmable, adaptive, and dynamic. Static, rule-based systems are insufficient. Instead, compliance must shift to a risk infrastructure that is: ### 1. Risk-in-Motion Monitoring Rather than flagging transactions after they settle, monitoring must happen in real time, detecting structuring, layering, and unusual flow patterns as they unfold. ### 2. Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening Name checks aren’t enough. Risk detection must consider wallet metadata, behavioural history, device intelligence, and network analysis to surface high-risk entities hidden behind pseudonyms. ### 3. Wallet Risk Scoring A static “high-risk wallet list” doesn’t work in a world where wallets are created and discarded easily. Risk scoring must be dynamic and contextual, combining geolocation, device, transaction history, and counterparties into evolving risk profiles. This is compliance at the speed of programmable money. ## Tookitaki’s FinCense: Building the Trust Layer for Stablecoins At Tookitaki, we’re not retrofitting legacy tools to fit this new world. We’re building the infrastructure-grade compliance layer programmable money deserves. Here’s how [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) powers trust on stablecoin rails: * **Risk-in-Motion Monitoring** Detects structuring, layering, and anomalous flows across chains in real time. * **Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening** Goes beyond simple lists, screening metadata, networks, and behavioural red flags. * **Wallet Risk Scoring** Integrates device, location, and transaction intelligence to give every wallet a living, breathing risk profile. * **Federated Intelligence from the** [**AFC Ecosystem**](https://www.afcecosystem.org) Scenarios contributed by 200+ compliance experts worldwide enrich the system with the latest typologies. * **Agentic AI for Investigations** Accelerates investigations with an AI copilot, surfacing insights and reducing [false positives](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/false-positives).

They’re reshaping payments, cross-border transfers, and financial inclusion. But they’re also rewriting the rules of financial crime. The next phase of growth won’t be defined by speed or accessibility alone — it will be defined by trust. And trust comes from compliance that can move as fast and adapt as dynamically as programmable money itself. Stablecoins will define the next decade of finance. Whether they become rails for inclusion or loopholes for crime depends on how we build trust today. Tookitaki’s FinCense is here to make that trust possible.

Beyond the headlines about Ferraris and luxury goods lies a sobering truth: criminals are still exploiting the blind spots in Australia’s financial crime defences.* ## A Case That Reads Like a Movie Script On 30 July 2025, Australian police raided properties across Sydney and arrested two men—Bing “Michael” Li, 38, and Yizhe “Tony” He, 34. Both men were charged with an astonishing 194 fraud-related offences. Li faces 87 charges tied to AUD 12.9 million, while He faces 107 charges tied to about AUD 4 million. Authorities also froze AUD 38 million worth of assets, including Bentleys, Ferraris, designer goods, and property leases. At the heart of the case was a fraud and laundering scheme that funnelled stolen money into the high-end economy of cars, luxury fashion, and short-term property leases. Investigators dubbed them “ghost cars”—vehicles purchased as a way to obscure illicit funds. It’s a tale that grabs attention for its glitz, but what really matters is the deeper lesson: Australia still has critical AML blind spots that criminals know how to exploit. ## How the Syndicate Operated The mechanics of the scheme reveal just how calculated it was: * **Rapid loan cycling:** The accused are alleged to have obtained loans, often short-term, which were cycled quickly to create complex repayment patterns. This made tracing the origins of funds difficult. * **Luxury asset laundering:** The money was used to purchase high-value cars (Ferraris, Bentleys, Mercedes) and designer items from brands like Louis Vuitton. Assets of prestige become a laundering tool, integrating dirty money into seemingly legitimate wealth. * **Property as camouflage:** Short-term leases of expensive properties in Barangaroo and other high-end districts provided both a lifestyle cover and another channel to absorb illicit funds. * **Gatekeeper loopholes:** Real estate agents, accountants, and luxury dealers in Australia are not yet fully bound by AML/CTF obligations. This gap created the perfect playground for laundering. What’s striking is not the creativity of the scheme—it’s the simplicity. By targeting sectors without AML scrutiny, the syndicate turned everyday transactions into a pipeline for cleaning millions. ## The Regulatory Gap This case lands at a critical time. For years, Australia has been under pressure from the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf) to extend AML/CTF laws to the so-called “gatekeeper professions”—real estate agents, accountants, lawyers, and dealers in high-value goods. As of 2025, these obligations are still not fully in place. The expansion is only scheduled to take effect from July 2026. Until then, large swathes of the economy remain outside [AUSTRAC](https://www.tookitaki.com/blog/austrac-aml-ctf-regulations-guide)’s oversight. The Barangaroo arrests underscore what critics have long warned: criminals don’t wait for legislation. They are already steps ahead, embedding illicit funds into sectors that regulators have yet to fence off. For businesses in real estate, luxury retail, and professional services, this case is more than a headline—it’s a wake-up call to prepare now, not later. ## Why This Case Matters for Australia The Barangaroo case isn’t just about two individuals—it highlights systemic vulnerabilities in the Australian financial ecosystem. 1. **Criminal Adaptation:** Syndicates will always pivot to the weakest link. If banks tighten their checks, criminals move to less regulated industries. 2. **Erosion of Trust:** When high-value markets become conduits for laundering, it damages Australia’s reputation as a clean, well-regulated financial hub. 3. **Compliance Risk:** Businesses in these sectors risk being blindsided by new regulations if they don’t start implementing AML controls now. 4. **Global Implications:** With assets like luxury cars and crypto being easy to move or sell internationally, local failures in AML quickly ripple across borders. This isn’t an isolated story. It’s part of a broader trend where fraud, luxury assets, and regulatory lag intersect to create fertile ground for financial crime. ## Lessons for Businesses For financial institutions, fintechs, and gatekeeper industries, the Barangaroo case offers several practical takeaways: * **Monitor for rapid loan cycling:** Short-term loans repaid unusually fast, or loans tied to sudden high-value purchases, should trigger alerts. * **Scrutinise asset purchases:** Repeated luxury acquisitions, especially where the source of funds is vague, are classic laundering red flags. * **Don’t rely solely on regulation:** Just because AML obligations aren’t mandatory yet doesn’t mean businesses can ignore risk. Voluntary adoption of AML best practices can prevent reputational damage. * **Collaborate cross-sector:** Banks, real estate firms, and luxury dealers must share intelligence. Laundering rarely stays within one sector. * **Prepare for 2026:** When the law expands, regulators will expect not just compliance but also readiness. Being proactive now can avoid penalties later. ## How Tookitaki’s FinCense Can Help The Barangaroo case demonstrates a truth that regulators and compliance teams already know: criminals are fast, and rules often move too slowly. This is where [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), Tookitaki’s AI-powered compliance platform, makes the difference. * **Scenario-based Monitoring** FinCense doesn’t just look for generic suspicious behaviour—it monitors for specific typologies like “rapid loan cycling leading to high-value asset purchases.” These scenarios mirror real-world cases, allowing institutions to spot laundering patterns early. * **Federated Intelligence** FinCense leverages insights from a global compliance community. A laundering method detected in one country can be quickly shared and simulated in others. If the Barangaroo pattern emerged elsewhere, FinCense could help Australian institutions adapt almost immediately. * **Agentic AI for Real-Time Detection** Criminal tactics evolve constantly. FinCense’s Agentic AI ensures models don’t go stale—it adapts to new data, learns continuously, and responds to threats as they arise. That means institutions don’t wait months for rule updates; they act in real time. * **End-to-End Compliance Coverage** From customer onboarding to transaction monitoring and investigation, FinCense provides a unified platform. For banks, this means capturing anomalies at multiple points, not just after funds have already flowed into cars and luxury handbags. The result is a system that doesn’t just tick compliance boxes but actively prevents fraud and laundering—protecting both businesses and Australia’s reputation. ## The Bigger Picture: Trust and Reputation Australia has ambitions to strengthen its role as a regional financial hub. But trust is the currency that underpins global finance. Cases like Barangaroo remind us that even one high-profile lapse can shake investor and customer confidence. With scams and laundering scandals making headlines globally—from Crown Resorts to major online frauds—Australia cannot afford to be reactive. For businesses, the message is clear: compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines, it’s about protecting your licence to operate. Customers and partners expect vigilance, transparency, and accountability. ## Conclusion: A Warning Shot The Barangaroo “ghost cars and luxury laundering” saga is more than a crime story—it’s a preview of what happens when regulation lags and businesses underestimate financial crime risk. With AUSTRAC set to extend AML coverage in 2026, industries like real estate and luxury retail must act now. Waiting until the law forces compliance could mean walking straight into reputational disaster. For financial institutions and businesses alike, the smarter path is to embrace advanced solutions like Tookitaki’s FinCense, which combine scenario-driven intelligence with adaptive AI. Because at the end of the day, Ferraris and Bentleys may be glamorous—but when they’re bought with dirty money, they carry a far higher cost.

Мы попытаемся разобраться с их пагубными последствиями для бизнеса и экономики в целом, а также понять методики, которые корпорации могут использовать, чтобы защитить себя от такой незаконной деятельности. Процесс отмывания денег (ОД) наносит значительный ущерб бизнесу, инвестиционному климату и экономической ситуации в целом. Это существенно **способствует росту преступности и коррупции и вызывает значительное снижение эффективности реального сектора экономики**. В результате эта преступная деятельность проявляется и многими другими последствиями. Масштабы такого противозаконного поведения в глобальном масштабе ошеломляют. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) сообщает, что каждый год от 2 до 5% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП) подвергается отмыванию денег на сумму от 754 миллиардов до 2 триллионов долларов. В юрисдикциях большинства стран **отмывание денег является тяжким преступлением, наказуемым лишением свободы и/или значительным штрафом.** Например, в Соединенных Штатах Америки наказание за соучастие в отмывании денег может быть довольно суровым: это либо штраф размером до 250 000 долларов или лишение свободы сроком до пяти лет. Многие предприятия могут не обращать внимания на реальность того, что их используют для отмывания денег. Несмотря на то, что не все коммерческие организации могут быть привлечены к ответственности за незаконную деятельность, осуществляемую через них, организации, обязанные соблюдать правила по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML), включая банки, должны соответствовать другому стандарту. **Последствия могут быть колоссальными, если противоправное поведение будет обнаружено в процессе аудита.** Например, Danske Bank недавно был оштрафован на 470 миллионов евро (495 миллионов долларов) из-за своего участия в международном скандале с отмыванием денег. Чтобы обезопасить свой бизнес от преступников и наложения нормативных штрафов, необходимо вникнуть в тонкости отмывания денег, включая распространенные схемы, которые обычно используются, и меры, которые можно предпринять для предотвращения этого. ## Что такое отмывание денег (ОД) и почему об этом важно знать Базовое определение процесса отмывания денег характеризуется умышленным сокрытием или искажением источника доходов, полученных незаконным путем, для создания впечатления, что средства были получены из законных источников. **Отмывание денег (ОД) предполагает действия, при которых злоумышленник скрывает источник средств, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности**, такой как незаконный оборот наркотиков, взяточничество или мошенничество. > *Действия по борьбе с отмыванием денег (ОД) часто связаны с борьбой с финансированием терроризма (ФТ), поскольку и ОД, и ФТ влекут за собой перенаправление средств.* Согласно выводам Группы разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ), ежегодно из стран с более низким уровнем дохода отмывается ошеломляющая сумма в 1,6 триллиона долларов, причём доходы, как правило, поступают от политической коррупции. В таких областях **коррупция усугубляет бедность, что ведёт к разрушению окружающей среды и вызывая экономический застой**. Из-за сложной связи между отмыванием денег и коррупцией любые инициативы, направленные на сдерживание распространения незаконных средств, также играют решающую роль в снижении уровня коррупции в глобальном масштабе. Такие виды деятельности, как незаконная продажа оружия, контрабанда и организованная преступность, включая незаконный оборот наркотиков и проституцию, могут приносить значительные суммы денег. Точно так же схемы хищения, инсайдерской торговли, взяточничества и компьютерного мошенничества могут приносить значительную прибыль и создавать стимулы для «узаконивания» доходов, полученных незаконным путём, посредством отмывания денег. Когда преступная деятельность приводит к значительной прибыли, **вовлечённые стороны должны найти способ сохранить контроль над средствами, не привлекая внимания к основной деятельности или причастным лицам**. Преступники делают это, маскируя источник средств, изменяя их форму или перемещая средства в место, где они с меньшей вероятностью привлекут внимание. В свете растущих опасений по поводу отмывания денег на саммите Большой семерки в Париже в 1989 году была создана Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) для выработки согласованного международного ответа. Одной из основных задач ФАТФ была разработка набора из 40 рекомендаций, в которых изложены меры, которые должны принять национальные правительства для реализации эффективных программ по борьбе с отмыванием денег. ## Сколько денег отмывается в год? По самой своей природе отмывание денег — это незаконная деятельность, совершаемая преступниками, которые действуют за пределами стандартных представлений об экономической и финансовой деятельности. В сочетании с другими аспектами скрытой экономической деятельности были предоставлены приблизительные значения, чтобы дать представление о масштабах рассматриваемой проблемы. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) провело всесторонний анализ, чтобы установить размер незаконных средств, полученных от наркотрафика и организованной преступности, и степень отмывания этих средств. В отчёте УНП ООН приблизительно указано, что **в 2009 году преступные доходы составили 3,6% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП)**, при этом 2,7% (что эквивалентно 1,6 триллионам долларов США) этих доходов было отмыто. Это соответствует широко цитируемой оценке Международного валютного фонда (МВФ), согласно которой в 1998 году общий объём отмывания денег в мире может составлять от двух до пяти процентов мирового ВВП. Используя статистику 1998 года, эти проценты позволяют предположить, что феномен отмывания денег колеблется от 590 миллиардов долларов США до 1,5 триллионов долларов США. На тот момент нижняя цифра была примерно соизмерима с общим объёмом производства в экономике, сопоставимой по размеру с экономикой Испании. Однако при рассмотрении приведённых выше оценок необходимо проявлять осторожность. Они просто предназначены для приблизительного определения масштабов отмывания денег. **Из-за тайного характера транзакций точные статистические данные недоступны**, что делает невозможным точную оценку общемирового количества денег, отмываемых каждый год. Поэтому Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) воздерживается от публикации каких-либо данных по этому поводу. ## Три основных этапа отмывания денег ### Этап размещения Незаконные средства могут быть интегрированы в финансовую систему прямо или косвенно. На этапе размещения наиболее распространенным методом является дробление больших сумм денег на более мелкие, менее заметные суммы, которые могут быть депонированы на один или несколько банковских счетов с использованием метода **«смурфинга»**. Компании по обслуживанию денег часто используются для осуществления смурфинга. **Другие методы размещения включают в себя:** * **Ложное выставление счетов-фактур** включает создание счетов-фактур за несуществующие товары или услуги для завышения или взимания платы за услуги, которые никогда не оказывались. Разница между фактической стоимостью товаров или услуг и завышенной суммой затем переводится как отмытые деньги. * **Смешивание незаконных денег с законными деньгами** — включает в себя внесение наличных, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности, на банковские счета с законно заработанными средствами, что затрудняет отслеживание незаконных средств правоохранительными органами. * **Покупка иностранной валюты** — включает в себя конвертацию больших сумм незаконных денег в другую валюту, которую затем можно положить на счета в иностранных банках или использовать для покупки активов в других странах. * **Покупка ценных бумаг или страховки за наличные** — предполагает покупку акций, облигаций или страховых полисов за наличные, которые впоследствии можно продать за чистые деньги. * **Азартные игры и ставки на спортивные события** — могут использоваться для отмывания денег путём размещения ставок за наличные деньги, полученные в результате незаконной деятельности, а затем получения выигрыша в виде чистых денег. ### Этап наслоения Процесс, известный как «наслоение», обозначает сложный набор действий, направленных на выявление незаконного происхождения денег и дальнейшую **маскировку их источника путём создания нескольких «слоёв» транзакций**, чтобы запутать след проверки. Эта изощренная практика служит цели сокрытия происхождения незаконно полученных активов, усложняя их обнаружение и отслеживание. Проведение фазы наслоения представляет собой наиболее сложную стадию этой мошеннической операции. Это влечёт за собой серию сложных финансовых транзакций, которые часто пересекают национальные границы посредством международных денежных переводов. Для реализации стратегии наслоения средства могут быть направлены через покупку и продажу различных типов инвестиций или через цепочку счетов, открытых в разных финансовых учреждениях в разных юрисдикциях. Такой капитал, полученный незаконным путём, часто перенаправляется в страны с разрешительными правилами по борьбе с отмыванием денег (БОД) или в страны, которые не сотрудничают с расследованиями по ПОД. ### Этап интеграции После того как незаконные деньги были успешно размещены и распределены, следующим этапом для преступников является реинтеграция или «возвращение» денег себе таким образом, чтобы скрыть их незаконное происхождение, сделав их «чистыми». По завершении этого этапа средства становятся частью законной финансовой системы и могут свободно использоваться преступниками. Основная цель этого этапа — **интегрировать деньги в экономику, не вызывая подозрений и не привлекая внимания правоохранительных органов**. Для достижения этой цели преступники могут приобретать такие активы, как недвижимость, произведения искусства, драгоценные украшения или дорогие автомобили, среди прочего. Эти виды активов могут служить для узаконивания ранее полученного незаконным путём капитала, поскольку они могут восприниматься как приобретённые законным путём. ## Как отмывание денег влияет на бизнес и экономику Отмывание денег представляет собой серьезную угрозу для бизнеса, что приводит к множеству неблагоприятных последствий, таких как потеря доходов, ущерб репутации и штрафы регулирующих органов на миллионы долларов или приостановление действия лицензий. Кроме того, социально-экономические последствия ОД имеют далеко идущие и разрушительные последствия с масштабным эффектом, таким как укоренение коррупции, эскалация преступной деятельности, подрыв доверия иностранных инвесторов, увеличение неравенства доходов и замедление экономического роста. Эти последствия вызывают особую озабоченность, поскольку они могут **осложнять и усугублять ранее существовавшие экономические и социальные проблемы**, создавая дальнейшую дестабилизацию и причиняя вред. Функционирование рынка банковских и финансовых услуг в рамках повышенных правовых, профессиональных и этических стандартов является неотъемлемой частью сохранения его целостности. Репутация финансового учреждения как честного является одним из его самых ценных активов. Предположим, что конкретное учреждение может обрабатывать средства, полученные в результате преступной деятельности, либо из-за взяточничества его сотрудников или директоров, либо из-за того, что они закрывают глаза на незаконный характер таких средств. В этом случае это **учреждение рискует стать активным соучастником преступников** и тем самым стать частью самой преступной сети. Любые доказательства такого соучастия обязательно навредят восприятию других финансовых посредников и регулирующих органов, помимо обычных клиентов. Неконтролируемое отмывание денег также чревато негативными макроэкономическими последствиями, такими как необъяснимые изменения в спросе на деньги, пруденциальные риски для надёжности банков, влияние “загрязнения” на законные финансовые операции и повышенная волатильность международных потоков капитала и обменных курсов из-за непредвиденных трансграничных переводов активов. Кроме того, успешное отмывание денег вознаграждает коррупцию и преступность, нанося ущерб целостности общества в целом, подрывая демократию и ставя под угрозу верховенство закона. Отмыватели денег постоянно ищут новые способы отмывания своих доходов, полученных нечестным путём. **Экономики с расширяющимися или появляющимися финансовыми центрами, но с недостаточными мерами защиты, особенно уязвимы**, поскольку страны с хорошо зарекомендовавшими себя финансовыми центрами внедряют обширные протоколы по борьбе с отмыванием денег. Отмыватели будут использовать различия в национальных системах борьбы с отмыванием денег, перемещая свои сети в страны и финансовые системы со слабыми или неэффективными мерами противодействия. Кто-то может возразить, что развивающиеся страны не могут быть слишком разборчивыми, когда речь идёт о привлечении капитала. Однако откладывать борьбу с мошенниками рискованно. Чем больше откладываются такие действия, тем более укоренившейся может стать организованная преступность. Подобно нарушению целостности конкретного финансового учреждения, присутствие организованной преступности, контролирующей и влияющей на коммерческий и финансовый сектор страны, **наносит ущерб прямым иностранным инвестициям**. > *Таким образом, борьба с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма имеет решающее значение для создания благоприятной деловой среды, что является необходимым условием устойчивого экономического развития.* Потенциальные социальные и политические последствия неустранённого или плохо управляемого отмывания денег могут быть серьёзными. Организованная преступность может проникнуть в финансовые учреждения, захватить контроль над значительной частью экономики посредством инвестиций или подкупить государственных чиновников и даже правительства. Экономическое и политическое влияние преступных организаций может подорвать общественное устройство, общие этические нормы и, в конечном счёте, демократические институты общества. В странах, переходящих к демократическим системам, криминальное влияние может подорвать этот переход. По своей сути **отмывание денег неразрывно связано с преступной деятельностью**, которая его породила. Благодаря отмыванию средств преступная деятельность может продолжаться. ## Как выявить и предотвратить отмывание денег Для обеспечения безопасности бизнеса и предотвращения финансовых преступлений необходимо внедрить комплексную программу соблюдения требований по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML). Такая программа должна чётко определять процедуры выявления, оценки и сообщения о подозрительной финансовой деятельности. **Следующие меры являются ключевыми компонентами эффективной программы ПОД:** * **Надлежащая проверка клиентов (CDD)**: прежде чем клиенту будет разрешено пользоваться услугами компании, он должен пройти тщательную надлежащую проверку клиентов. Этот процесс включает в себя получение и проверку информации о клиентах, например, их документов, удостоверяющих личность, и оценку того, представляют ли они какой-либо потенциальный риск участия в преступной деятельности. * **Расширенная комплексная проверка (EDD)**: в случаях, когда существует более высокий риск отмывания денег, компании обязаны применять меры расширенной комплексной проверки. Одним из наиболее важных элементов EDD является тщательная проверка источников средств клиентов, чтобы убедиться, что они не получены в результате незаконной деятельности. * **Непрерывный мониторинг клиентов**: это дополнительный уровень управления рисками, который включает в себя постоянный мониторинг транзакций клиентов и проведение периодических проверок для выявления и оценки любых подозрительных действий. * **Независимые аудиты AML:** эти аудиты позволяют предприятиям выявлять и устранять любые недостатки и недочёты в своих стратегиях соблюдения AML до проверок регулирующими органами, чтобы предотвратить санкции или штрафы. * **KYT или мониторинг транзакций:** мониторинг транзакций — это непрерывный процесс обеспечения безопасности, который позволяет компаниям обнаруживать и предотвращать подозрительные транзакции. Надёжная программная платформа KYT может выявлять необычные схемы, тщательно проверять сомнительные переводы и отслеживать транзакции в цифровой или фиатной валюте. Это помогает предотвращать и выявлять отмывание денег и другие финансовые преступления. ## Услуги [АМЛ консалтинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/) [АМЛ поддержка](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-podderzhka/) [AML обучение](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-obuchenie/) [АМЛ аутсорсинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-autsorsing/) [Индивидуальные решения для аудита AML для бизнеса](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-audit/) ОСТАВЬТЕ ЗАЯВКУ И ПОЛУЧИТЕ КОНСУЛЬТАЦИЮ * [Открытие банковских счетов](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/) + [По сферам](#) - [Для финансовых компаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-finansovyh-kompanij/) - [Для физических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-fizicheskih-lic/) - [Для юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-juridicheskih-lic/) - [Для криптокомпаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/otkrytie-schetov-dlja-kriptokompanij/) + [По странам](#) - [Открыть счет в ОАЭ (Дубай)](https://coredo.eu/ru/oaje-dubaj/) - [Открыть счет в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/avstrija/) - [Открыть счет в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/velikobritanija/) - [Открыть счет в Сингапуре](https://coredo.eu/ru/singapur-2/) - [Другие страны](/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/#countries) * [Регистрация юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) + [Разделы](#) - [Регистрация компании в Чехии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-chehii-2/) - [Регистрация компании в Словакии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-slovakii/) - [Регистрация компании на Кипре](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-na-kipre/) - [Регистрация компании в Люксембурге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ljuksemburge/) - [Регистрация компании в Гонконге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-gonkonge/) - [Регистрация компании в Эстонии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-jestonii/) - [Регистрация компании в Греции](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-grecii/) - [Регистрация компании в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-velikobritanii/) - [Регистрация компании в Ирландии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-irlandii/) - [Регистрация компании в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-avstrii/) - [Регистрация компании в Испании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ispanii/) - [Другие страны](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) * [Инструменты для финансовых институтов](#) + [Разделы](#) - [Интернет эквайринг](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/internet-jekvajring/) - [Эмиссия карт](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/jemissija-kart-vypusk-debitovyh-kart/) - [SEPA/SWIFT, IBAN интеграция](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/sepa-swift-iban-integracii/) - [Паспортизация лицензий](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/pasportizacija-licenzij/) - [Программное обеспечение](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/programmnoe-obespechenie/) * [Бухгалтерское обслуживание](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/buhgalterskoe-obsluzhivanie/) * [Компании на продажу](https://coredo.eu/ru/kompanii-na-prodazhu/) * [О компании COREDO](https://coredo.eu/ru/o-kompanii/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Контакты](https://coredo.eu/ru/kontakty/) * [Общие положения и условия](https://coredo.eu/ru/uslovija-i-polozhenija/) * [Политика использования файлов cookie](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-ispolzovanija-fajlov-cookie/) * [Политика конфиденциальности](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-konfidencialnosti/) * [Объявление о политике информирования](https://coredo.eu/ru/obyavlenie-o-politike-informirovaniya-whistleblowing/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Подписаться на новости](#subscribe) * [Информационное предупреждение](https://coredo.eu/ru/informacionnoe-preduprezhdenie/) * [Словарь](https://coredo.eu/ru/dictionary/) [+420 228 886 867](tel:+420 228 886 867 \"Phone\") [info@coredo.eu](mailto:info@coredo.eu \"Email\") K Cervenemu dvoru 3269/25a, Прага, 130 00, Чехия [Карта сайта](https://coredo.eu/ru/karta-sajta/) © 2025 Авторские права ©RES JUDICATA s.r.o.

[ENG](http://din-eka.com/ \"Switch to english version\") Прозрачность и подотчетность - ключевые аспекты современного корпоративного управления ====================================================================================== 07.06.2024 11:50 ![Image 2](https://dineka.ru/upload/medialibrary/6cf/6cfb199dfe2492feb845e128005e447d.png) Многие страны ввели законодательные изменения, направленные на повышение прозрачности корпоративного управления. Эти меры помогают бороться с финансовыми преступлениями, коррупцией и улучшить деловую репутацию компаний на международной арене. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты этих изменений и их влияние на бизнес. ##### Международные изменения в законодательстве * **AMLD в ЕС** Директива Европейского Союза по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AMLD) представляет собой серию мер, направленных на усиление прозрачности и подотчетности. Последние изменения включают требования к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах, создание централизованных регистров и обязательное сообщение о подозрительных транзакциях. Эти меры направлены на предотвращение отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма. * **Законы о корпоративной прозрачности в США** В США Законы о корпоративной прозрачности, такие как Закон о корпоративной прозрачности 2020 года (Corporate Transparency Act), требуют от компаний раскрытия информации о своих конечных бенефициарных владельцах в FinCEN. Это помогает правительственным органам бороться с незаконными финансовыми операциями и повышает уровень корпоративной подотчетности. * **Инициативы G20** Инициативы G20 включают в себя автоматический обмен информацией о финансовых счетах между странами-членами. Это значительно усложняет уклонение от уплаты налогов и способствует более прозрачной и справедливой налоговой системе. Эти меры также включают рекомендации по внедрению стандартов прозрачности и подотчетности на национальном уровне. ##### Международные стандарты и рекомендации Для повышения прозрачности и подотчётности в корпоративном управлении, а также для борьбы с финансовыми преступлениями, на международном уровне были разработаны и внедрены несколько ключевых стандартов и рекомендаций. Рассмотрим их подробнее. * **Директивы FATF** Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (FATF) разрабатывает международные стандарты по борьбе с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. Рекомендации FATF включают требования к идентификации клиентов, мониторингу транзакций и отчетности о подозрительных действиях. * **OECD Guidelines** Руководящие принципы Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (OECD) по корпоративному управлению включают рекомендации по прозрачности, подотчетности и соблюдению этических стандартов. Эти принципы помогают компаниям улучшить свои управленческие практики и повысить доверие со стороны заинтересованных сторон. * **ISO 37001** ISO 37001 — международный стандарт по системам управления антикоррупционной деятельностью, который предоставляет руководство по предотвращению, выявлению и реагированию на коррупцию. Внедрение этого стандарта помогает компаниям минимизировать риски коррупции и повысить уровень корпоративной этики. ##### Новые вызовы для корпоративного управления Компании должны уделять больше внимания процессам проверки и утверждения своих контрагентов. Это связано с усилением требований к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах и топ-менеджерах, которые могут оказывать значительное влияние на деятельность компании. В частности, внимание уделяется следующим аспектам: * Окончательные владельцы (UBO). В законодательстве многих стран усилились требования по раскрытию информации о физических лицах, которые в конечном итоге контролируют компанию. Это помогает бороться с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. * Профессиональные CEO. Компании должны убедиться, что их руководители обладают не только профессиональными навыками, но и соответствуют высоким стандартам этики и подотчётности. * Значимые бенефициары. Необходимо учитывать влияние значимых бенефициаров на стратегические решения компании и обеспечить их прозрачность. ##### Почему это важно? Проверка контрагентов и раскрытие информации о них имеет несколько ключевых преимуществ: * **Снижение рисков.** Компании могут лучше защищаться от финансовых преступлений и коррупции, зная, кто именно контролирует их контрагентов. * **Укрепление репутации.** Прозрачность и подотчётность повышают доверие инвесторов и партнёров. * **Соблюдение законодательства.** Соблюдение международных и национальных требований помогает избежать штрафов и юридических проблем. * **Улучшение бизнес-отношений.** Прозрачные процедуры способствуют укреплению доверия и партнёрских отношений. ##### Санкции за несоблюдение требований Компании, не соблюдающие требования по раскрытию информации и проверке контрагентов, могут столкнуться с серьезными санкциями: * **Финансовые штрафы.** Значительные денежные штрафы, налагаемые регуляторами. * **Юридические последствия.** Судебные разбирательства и уголовные преследования. * **Репутационные потери.** Потеря доверия и деловой репутации. Вот несколько интересных примеров как недостаточные проверки привели к серьёзным потерям: * **Airbnb и незаконная сдача жилья в аренду** В 2020 году компания Airbnb столкнулась с юридическими проблемами в Германии из-за того, что не проверяла легальность сдачи жилья в аренду. Власти Берлина обвинили компанию в том, что она позволяла сдавать квартиры без соответствующих разрешений, что нарушало местные законы о краткосрочной аренде. В результате Airbnb пришлось заплатить значительные штрафы и изменить свои процедуры проверки арендодателей, чтобы соответствовать местным законам. Этот случай подчеркивает важность проверки соответствия контрагентов местным законодательным требованиям. * **Standard Chartered и отмывание денег** В 2019 году банк Standard Chartered был оштрафован на 1,1 миллиарда долларов за нарушение законов о борьбе с отмыванием денег в США и Великобритании. Расследование показало, что банк не проводил достаточную проверку своих клиентов и их транзакций, что позволило преступным организациям отмывать деньги через его счета. Недостаточная проверка привела к финансовым и репутационным потерям для банка и подчеркнула необходимость строгих процедур соблюдения норм по борьбе с отмыванием денег. * **Danske Bank и скандал с отмыванием денег** В 2018 году Danske Bank оказался в центре одного из крупнейших скандалов с отмыванием денег в Европе. Через эстонское подразделение банка прошло около 200 миллиардов евро подозрительных транзакций. В результате банк был оштрафован на сотни миллионов долларов, его руководство подверглось серьезной критике, и банк понес огромные репутационные потери. Расследование показало, что банк не проверял должным образом своих клиентов и не проводил адекватный мониторинг транзакций. * **Volkswagen и нарушение требований по проверке поставщиков** В 2015 году разразился скандал с Volkswagen, когда выяснилось, что компания использовала программное обеспечение для обхода экологических тестов на выбросы. Расследование показало, что компания недостаточно проверяла своих поставщиков и производителей компонентов, что позволило этим нарушениям оставаться незамеченными. Скандал привел к штрафам на миллиарды долларов и нанес серьёзный ущерб репутации компании. ##### Выводы Современные требования к проверке контрагентов и раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах требуют от компаний пересмотра своих внутренних процессов и структур. Прозрачность и подотчётность становятся неотъемлемыми элементами успешного корпоративного управления. Внедрение этих изменений не только поможет компаниям соответствовать законодательным требованиям, но и укрепит их позиции на рынке, повышая доверие со стороны инвесторов и партнёров. Внедрение новых стандартов корпоративного управления и проверок контрагентов играет ключевую роль в глобальной борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями. Более строгие процедуры помогают выявлять и предотвращать попытки отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма (с) Деловой центр \"ДИНЕКА\" Д.Е.

finance, les gatekeepers tels que les comptables et les avocats sont censés se prémunir contre la criminalité financière. Pourtant, ces mêmes acteurs peuvent parfois devenir des partenaires involontaires, voire complices, de systèmes de blanchiment d\\'argent. L\\'expertise qui rend ces professionnels indispensables aux entreprises offre également aux criminels la possibilité de les exploiter dans le cadre d\\'activités illicites. Dans cet article, nous examinerons comment ces intermédiaires peuvent être utilisés pour blanchir des fonds illégaux, la législation relative aux gatekeepers et à la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, ainsi que des exemples concrets d\\'utilisation de ces intermédiaires à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent. Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'un gatekeeper ? ---------------------------- Un **gatekeeper** est une personne ou une entité qui contrôle l\\'accès à quelque chose, agissant souvent comme une barrière ou un filtre entre différentes parties. Dans divers contextes, les gatekeepers ont l\\'autorité ou la responsabilité de réglementer, de gérer ou de contrôler l\\'entrée, la participation ou le flux d\\'informations ou de ressources. ![Image 10: Gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-lawyers.png) Dans le **contexte financier et juridique**, les gatekeepers sont des professionnels tels que des comptables, des avocats, des banquiers, des auditeurs et d\\'autres experts chargés de garantir l\\'intégrité et la légalité des transactions et des activités financières. Quelles sont les tâches des gatekeepers dans le cadre de la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent ? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Le rôle du [gatekeeper dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux](https://febelfin.be/media/pages/publicaties/2021/banken-gatekeepers-in-de-strijd-tegen-witwassen/23291479c0-1694763198/brochure_aml_en.pdf)implique un devoir de vigilance permanent tout au long de la relation d\\'affaires : * 1 **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Comprendre parfaitement l\\'identité et les antécédents du client. Cela se fait généralement lors de l\\'onboarding de nouveaux clients, afin de s\\'assurer que leurs activités sont conformes aux normes juridiques et éthiques. * 2 **Know Your Transaction (KYT)**: Contrôler et comprendre la nature des transactions du client. Le KYT permet d\\'identifier les transactions suspectes ou inhabituelles qui peuvent indiquer une activité illicite, telle que le blanchiment d\\'argent, en signalant les incohérences par rapport au comportement attendu. * 3 **Vérifier l\\'origine des actifs**: S\\'assurer que les actifs impliqués dans les transactions proviennent de sources légitimes. Cela devient particulièrement important lorsque les transactions ou les transferts d\\'actifs d\\'un client sont anormaux ou ne correspondent pas à ses antécédents financiers. * 4 **Risk-Based Approach**: mise en oeuvre de mesures fondées sur le niveau de risque associé à chaque client et à chaque transaction. Les clients ou les transactions considérés comme présentant un risque plus élevé, tels que ceux impliquant des transferts de grande valeur ou des [personnes politiquement exposées (PPE)](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/personne-politiquement-expos%C3%A9e-ppe/), font l\\'objet d\\'une vigilance accrue, tandis que les clients présentant un risque moins élevé peuvent faire l\\'objet de contrôles moins stricts. * 5 **Respecter les embargos financiers**: Respecter les restrictions légales sur les transactions financières avec certaines entités ou certains pays. La conformité est essentielle pour éviter les sanctions et empêcher la facilitation des transactions illicites. * 6 **Limiter l\\'utilisation de l\\'argent liquide**: La limitation des transactions en espèces est une mesure essentielle dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, car l\\'argent liquide est difficile à retracer et est couramment utilisé dans les activités illicites. * 7 **Obligations de déclaration**: Les professionnels désignés sont légalement tenus de signaler aux autorités compétentes, telles que la cellule de renseignement financier (CRF) locale, toute activité suspecte susceptible d\\'indiquer un blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'autres délits financiers. * 8 **Conformité et adaptation continue**: Les gatekeepers doivent se tenir au courant des best practices, réviser les protocoles internes et s\\'assurer qu\\'ils sont bien formés pour reconnaître et traiter les risques liés au blanchiment d\\'argent et à la criminalité financière. Comment les gatekeepers sont-ils utilisés pour le blanchiment d\\'argent ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Les gatekeepers sont utilisés de diverses manières pour contribuer au blanchiment d\\'argent pour le compte de criminels. En voici quelques exemples : **Rôle des professionnels du domaine légal** **Création de sociétés écrans**: Les avocats sont souvent utilisés pour créer des sociétés écrans et des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui dissimulent la propriété et l\\'origine des fonds. Les avocats peuvent concevoir des structures de sociétés à plusieurs niveaux avec des entités dans différentes juridictions, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux d\\'argent ou d\\'identifier les véritables propriétaires. [![Image 11: Gatekeepers and shell companies](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg) **Transactions immobilières**: Les avocats jouent un rôle essentiel dans l\\'[organisation des transactions immobilières](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/comment-blanchir-argent-de-immobilier-aml/), la gestion des contrats et le respect des exigences légales et réglementaires. Les criminels exploitent souvent cette possibilité en achetant des propriétés de grande valeur avec de l\\'argent blanchi, ce qui leur permet d\\'intégrer ces fonds illicites dans l\\'économie légitime. [![Image 12: Gatekeepers and real estate](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg) **Rôle des comptables et des auditeurs** **Manipulation des états financiers**: Les comptables peuvent se livrer à des activités frauduleuses en falsifiant les documents financiers pour masquer la véritable nature des fonds. Ils peuvent gonfler les chiffres d\\'affaires en créant de fausses transactions commerciales, en émettant de fausses factures ou en enregistrant des ventes inexistantes afin de donner une fausse image de la santé financière d\\'une entreprise. En outre, ils peuvent manipuler les flux de revenus en fabriquant des revenus provenant de produits ou de services inexistants. [![Image 13: Gatekeepers and financial statement manipulation](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg) **Les stratagèmes d\\'évasion fiscale**: Les comptables peuvent s\\'engager dans des pratiques telles que la fabrication de dépenses et la sous-déclaration de revenus pour créer un profil financier trompeur. Cette manipulation permet non seulement [de réduire les obligations fiscales](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-and-crime.html), mais contribue également à la mise en place d\\'une structure complexe qui rend de plus en plus difficile l\\'identification de la véritable source des fonds. [![Image 14: Gatekeepers and illegal tax schemes](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg) Quels sont les exemples d\\'utilisation de gatekeepers à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent ? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au Canada, plusieurs avocats ont été impliqués dans des affaires de blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'activités financières suspectes, mettant en évidence leur rôle involontaire ou délibéré dans la facilitation d\\'opérations criminelles. Parmi les cas les plus marquants, on peut citer : * **Simon Rosenfeld**, un avocat de Toronto qui a [été condamné en 2005](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/5-canadian-lawyers-accused-of-money-laundering-or-suspicious-financial-transactions-1.6942083) après s\\'être vanté auprès d\\'un agent infiltré du laxisme du Canada en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. Sa peine a été alourdie en appel. * **Florence Yen**, une avocate spécialisée dans l\\'immobilier à Vancouver, qui a été suspendue pendant trois mois en 2021 pour avoir manipulé plus de 14 millions de dollars provenant d\\'un client sans fournir de services juridiques ni enquêter sur l\\'origine des fonds. * **Ronald Pelletier**, radié du barreau en 2023, pour avoir déplacé 31 millions de dollars pour le compte de clients impliqués dans des fraudes boursières aux États-Unis, en utilisant des téléphones à mémoire cachée pour dissimuler ses activités. En Europe, le [scandale de la Danske Bank en 2018](https://www.euronews.com/2022/12/14/danske-bank-fined-470m-over-international-money-laundering-scandal) est un cas bien connu d\\'avocats ayant permis le blanchiment d\\'argent. Ce scandale a révélé le rôle des professionnels, y compris des avocats, dans la facilitation du blanchiment d\\'environ 200 milliards d\\'euros de fonds suspects par l\\'intermédiaire de la succursale estonienne de la banque entre 2007 et 2015. Les avocats ont abusé du contrôle réglementaire indulgent de l\\'Estonie et ont créé des sociétés écrans avec des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui impliquaient des transactions transfrontalières. Quelle est la réglementation en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les gatekeepers ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La législation visant à réglementer les gatekeepers comprend des dispositions qui exigent de ces professionnels qu\\'ils mettent en oeuvre de solides mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux (AML) et qu\\'ils signalent les activités suspectes. Voici quelques cadres législatifs et mesures clés : **Union européenne** ![Image 15: EU AML directive gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-europe-eu.png) L\\'[Union européenne a adopté plusieurs directives](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/eu-directives-anti-blanchiment/) (e.g. la 4e et 5e directive AML) qui fixent des exigences en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les personnes chargées du contrôle et d\\'autres professionnels. Il s\\'agit notamment d\\'obligations en matière d\\'évaluation des risques, de vigilance à l\\'égard des clients et de déclaration des transactions suspectes. Les gatekeepers jouent un rôle essentiel en veillant à ce que les entreprises tiennent des registres précis de leurs structures de propriété. Ils sont chargés de faciliter le respect des réglementations qui exigent que ces informations sur la propriété soient accessibles aux autorités compétentes et aux entités obligées. La cinquième directive anti-blanchiment souligne encore cette responsabilité en exigeant que les informations relatives à la propriété soient mises à la disposition des personnes et des entités ayant un intérêt légitime. **États-Unis d\\'Amérique** Le Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) exige des entités de contrôle qu\\'elles établissent et maintiennent des programmes efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, qu\\'elles fassent preuve de diligence à l\\'égard des clients, qu\\'elles établissent des déclarations sur les activités suspectes (SAR) et qu\\'elles se conforment à d\\'autres exigences en matière de rapports. La loi prévoit également des sanctions en cas de non-respect de ces obligations. Les gatekeepers sont également tenus d\\'établir un rapport sur les transactions en devises (CTR) pour tout dépôt, retrait, échange de devises ou autre paiement ou transfert impliquant plus de $10.000 en espèces ou plus au cours d\\'une même journée. ![Image 16: Currency transaction reports for gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-transactions.png) Il existe également la [Gatekeeper Initiative](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminaljustice/gatekeeper_faq.pdf), une initiative gouvernementale visant à imposer des exigences strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent et le financement du terrorisme aux principaux professionnels qui agissent en tant que gatekeepers des systèmes financiers nationaux et internationaux. **Groupe d\\'action financière (GAFI)** Le GAFI reconnaît le rôle essentiel que jouent les gatekeepers dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Il encourage les pays à appliquer ses recommandations concernant les gatekeepers dans le cadre de leurs lois et réglementations nationales, afin de renforcer le cadre général de la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Dans l\\'[examen horizontal de la conformité technique des entités de contrôle en matière de corruption](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/Gatekeeper-TC-Corruption.html) réalisé en 2024, il a été noté que si de nombreux membres du GAFI ont obtenu un score supérieur à 80 % en ce qui concerne l\\'application des recommandations du GAFI sur les entités de contrôle, sept grandes économies - représentant plus de la moitié du PIB mondial - ont obtenu un score inférieur à 50 %. Des obligations essentielles telles que le devoir de vigilance à l\\'égard de la clientèle restent faibles. Il est nécessaire de maintenir un contrôle et un équilibre sur les gatekeepers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Les gatekeepers sont essentiels au système financier, et leur rôle et expertise peuvent être exploités par les blanchisseurs d\\'argent pour intégrer, superposer et finalement légitimer des fonds illicites. C\\'est pourquoi il est essentiel d\\'imposer à ces professionnels des obligations strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. ![Image 17: Gatekeepers and KYC](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-kyc.png) Des mesures efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, notamment des procédures de connaissance du client (KYC), le suivi des transactions et la déclaration des activités suspectes, permettent de s\\'assurer que les gatekeepers constituent une barrière plutôt qu\\'un canal pour les activités de blanchiment d\\'argent. Pour empêcher les gatekeepers de faciliter le blanchiment de capitaux, il faut adopter une approche globale impliquant l\\'application de la réglementation, des contrôles internes rigoureux et une surveillance proactive. En mettant en oeuvre ces stratégies, nous pouvons renforcer les défenses du système financier contre le blanchiment de capitaux et veiller à ce que les gatekeepers remplissent leur rôle essentiel dans la prévention de la criminalité financière.

The case marks a profound turning point for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in the banking sector. The exposure of the scandal revealed that billions of euros were laundered through its Estonian branch. It turned out that the existing AML control mechanisms were far from sufficient to prevent such illegal activities. This realization sparked a compliance revolution aimed at preventing future system failures and preserving the integrity of the financial market. ## The Exposure of a Gigantic Money Laundering Network The Danske Bank scandal embodies one of the most severe cases of money laundering within the European banking sector. The revelation that the bank\\'s Estonian branch served as a hub for dubious money flows caused significant uproar. It painted a picture of convoluted transaction paths, the ends of which were shrouded in darkness. The uncovering of the scandal provided initial hints at this. Over the years, funds amounting to more than 200 billion euros with suspicious origins found their way through the financial institution. Between 2007 and 2015, money laundering activities took place through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. The scale and complexity of these activities were only fully understood after intense investigations. Thousands of suspicious transactions, involving billions of dollars, were carried out without the necessary AML controls being effective. The Danske Bank affair has exposed the Achilles\\' heel of the financial world: effective mechanisms to prevent money laundering are not only desirable but vital for the integrity of the entire banking system. Internal security systems should be capable of identifying and reporting such massive movements. However, at Danske Bank, these systems failed entirely. This realization has highlighted an urgent need for a profound transformation in the approach to combating money laundering in the European banking sector. Key aspects: * Identification of opaque money flows * Failures in the internal control system * Revision of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) guidelines The significance of the case is partly due to the involvement of a well-known bank: Danske Bank. This has severely impacted its trust among customers and within the financial world. The case prompted a detailed investigation of the incident, scrutinizing the corporate culture and the compliance structure, which proved inadequate for managing money laundering risks. | **Area** | **Description** | **Consequence** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Revelation** | Fake customers and suspicious money flows | Stricter AML regulations and monitoring | | **Financial Volume** | Over €200 billion in suspicious transfers | Investigations and penalties | | **Control Systems** | Failure in detection and reporting | Concerns about risk management infrastructure | | **International Impact** | Affects the reputation of the entire European banking sector | Loss of trust and demands for transparency | ## ## **Scale and Consequences of the Money Laundering Affair** Following the revelation of the money laundering affair, the financial world is now focused on its enormous scope and severe consequences. The suspicious transactions that were uncovered shed light on the existing regulatory deficits in the banking sector and the necessity for effective anti-money laundering measures. ### **Dimensions of the Scandal** The dimensions of the affair are staggering: A gigantic volume of suspicious money transactions remained undetected for years. This indicates that both the financial supervision and the internal control mechanisms of the affected institutions failed. It is clear that despite existing regulations, there was a lack of consistent implementation. ### **Responses from the Financial World and Regulators** The response from the European Central Bank and national financial regulatory authorities was a comprehensive suite of actions. Their measures ranged from tightening regulatory protocols to discussions about ethical responsibility in the financial sector. These incidents have led to a rethinking and the development of new strategies in the fight against money laundering to restore public trust. ### **Economic and Reputational Damage** The reputational damage is immense. The affected bank not only struggled with losses in its stock value but also faced a profound crisis of confidence that questioned the credibility of the entire sector. The long-term effects of this crisis are not yet fully apparent. However, it is clear that comprehensive and sustainable reforms are necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future. These reforms are intended to bolster the integrity and accountability within the financial sector. ## **AML-Anti Money Laundering: Principles and Challenges** Combating money laundering, known as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), is a fundamental pillar in the financial sector. It aims to ensure the integrity and stability of the market. Banks and financial institutions are required to adhere to strict compliance guidelines to efficiently detect and prevent money laundering activities. Effective risk management plays a fundamental role in AML compliance. The identification, assessment, and management of risks are key elements in developing sustainable strategies against these threatening practices. Due diligence procedures, which involve the careful scrutiny of business partners, are also essential to counter potential threats and meet strict regulatory requirements. | **Basic Principle** | **Challenges** | **Strategies** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Customer Identification (KYC)** | Inefficiency in data collection | Automated verification systems | | **Transaction Monitoring** | False positive alerts | Refinement of algorithms | | **Due Diligence Procedures** | Lack of transparency | Extended due diligence checks | | **Suspicious Activity Reporting** | Timely capture of data | Training and clear procedural workflows | | **Risk Assessment** | Changing risk landscape | Dynamic risk models | The challenges in anti-money laundering are diverse and complex. Given the constantly changing methods of money laundering, financial institutions must remain agile and continuously adapt their AML systems. It is not only crucial to identify risks; comprehensive compliance guidelines are decisive in preventing future scandals. They help to strengthen public trust in the banking sector. ## **The European Context and the Role of Instant Payments** The money laundering activities of Danske Bank have exposed the interconnections within the European banking sector. It becomes clear that money laundering is not an isolated problem of a single institution. Rather, it represents a systemic risk that requires a coordinated response at the European and global level. In this context, the role of instant payments must be considered. On one hand, they accelerate payment transactions. On the other hand, they pose new challenges for AML compliance. The integration of effective AML controls into instant payment processes is crucial. ## The Role of Technology and Innovation in AML Compliance With the advent of disruptive technologies, the approach to risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements has fundamentally changed. In the fight against financial crimes such as money laundering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced AML technologies have become indispensable tools. They not only significantly enhance efficiency in AML processes but also contribute substantially to fraud detection and the prevention of financial crimes. ## Laws and Regulations for Combating Money Laundering **Switzerland** In Switzerland, money laundering is combated through the following laws and regulations: **Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG):** This law, applicable to financial intermediaries, regulates the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It also ensures due diligence in financial transactions. **Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GwV):** This ordinance regulates the professional practice of acting as a financial intermediary. It also sets out the supervisory and reporting obligations for traders. **FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GWV-FINMA):** This ordinance specifies how financial intermediaries must fulfill their obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. **EU** Money Laundering Directive: The EU\\'s Money Laundering Directive was enacted in 1991 and has been revised several times since then. The EU regulations aim to protect the EU\\'s financial system. It is the responsibility of each EU member state to transpose the Money Laundering Directive into national law. Regulation to Combat Money Laundering: In July 2021, the European Commission presented a package of legislative proposals. These proposals aim to further strengthen and improve the enforcement of EU regulations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT). The package envisages the establishment of an EU authority to combat money laundering, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for credit and financial institutions. Additionally, the package includes regulations on obligations of the private sector and a revised regulation on money transfers. **Germany** Money Laundering Act (GwG): The German Money Laundering Act is the legal implementation of the EU Directive of 2015 and aims at effectively prosecuting money launderers. It has been revised multiple times and has been in its current version since July 2, 2023. Criminal Code (StGB): According to § 261 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), \"money laundering\" is punishable in Germany. Individuals who conceal, use, or dispose of unlawfully acquired assets are committing a criminal offense. The Role of Regulatory Authorities Regulatory authorities such as the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) play a central role in combating money laundering in Switzerland. Similarly, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) plays a crucial role in combating money laundering in Germany. They are responsible for monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations at banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions. Independent asset managers and trustees in Switzerland are indirectly supervised through the Supervisory Organization (SO) by the regulatory authority (AO). In addition, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) exist here, which non-prudentially supervised financial service providers must join. The SROs are in turn approved and supervised by FINMA. In Germany, BaFin also pursues a preventive approach to combating money laundering. The BaFin regulatory authority is supported by the Federal Office for Combating Financial Market Crime (BBF), established in October 2023, as a federal supervisory authority. It consolidates supervision, analysis, and criminal investigations into money laundering matters. The automated functionality of this tool provides a time- and resource-saving way to identify risks. At the same time, it allows the compliance team to focus more on strategic case management. This optimization of workflow ensures efficient use of relevant resources, while companies maintain the highest standards of compliance and risk prevention. ## Future Challenges in Combating Money Laundering The increasing digitization, growing global financial flows, and cryptocurrencies pose new challenges for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). As money laundering is a global issue, addressing it requires not only adapting existing control mechanisms but also enhanced international cooperation. In addition to ongoing adjustments to laws and regulations, there is a need to harmonize them across borders. Strengthening collaboration at the international level is crucial because criminals\\' methods are becoming more sophisticated. Criminals are now utilizing cryptocurrencies for money laundering, adding complexity to detection efforts. Authorities and investigators are placing high hopes on the use of new methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in combating money laundering. These new technologies will play a significant role in fraud detection and identifying anomalies in financial transactions. ## Conclusion The harrowing tale of the Danske Bank scandal has exposed a shocking truth about the banking sector, revealing the severe consequences of inadequate AML compliance. Numerous lessons have been drawn from this money laundering affair, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive control mechanisms and transparent financial flows. Banks are challenged not only to react to scandals but to proactively act as elements in the fight against criminal financial activities. The future of AML compliance will increasingly be shaped by digital innovations and the integration of advanced technologies. This requires investments in intelligent solutions capable of identifying and analyzing even the most sophisticated suspicions. The pursuit of a seamless compliance culture generates a growing demand for skilled professionals. These professionals must be trained not only in the analysis of large volumes of data but also in relationship-building and due diligence. Given the events surrounding the Danske Bank, the need for dynamic, adaptable, and internationally coordinated AML policies is evident. The pioneers for a secure banking world in the 21st century are institutions that consider transparency and integrity as part of their corporate philosophy. They view these values not only as legal requirements but as essential elements in restoring public trust. Together, the sector can create resilient structures that are resistant to the threats of financial crime. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening as a Solution The Pythagoras Transaction Screening module is the optimal solution for reviewing incoming and outgoing payments.

Согласно договоренности, полученные от США миллионы направляются на профилактику, выявление и расследование финансовых преступлений, включая отмывание денег, киберпреступления и финансирование терроризма. Соглашение одновременно укрепляет взаимодействие Эстонии и США в противодействии финансовым преступлениям и подчеркивает нашу совместную приверженность принципам правового государства во всем мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов курирует комиссия, в состав которой входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом конкурсном раунде поддержаны девять предложений на общую сумму 25,7 млн евро. Комиссия исходила из того, что проекты должны представлять собой логическое целое и усиливать потенциал не отдельных учреждений, а системно укреплять борьбу с финансовой преступностью. Целью является поддержка профилактики, совершенствование практик расследования, технологическая поддержка и устойчивое обучение. Это поможет обеспечить осведомленность специалистов, работающих в столь сложной сфере, о последних достижениях, рисках и технологических изменениях, а также способность успешно применять полученные навыки и знания. Инициативы нацелены на предупреждение коррупции, повышение осведомленности о финансовых мошенничествах, эффективное выявление, арест и конфискацию преступных доходов, наращивание потенциала в борьбе с киберпреступлениями, улучшение возможностей по выявлению и анализу доходов от криптоактивов, а также на укрепление финансового надзора для более эффективного противодействия отмыванию денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент полиции безопасности, Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция и все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. «То, что штрафные средства по делам об отмывании денег направляются на проекты по сокращению экономической преступности, имеет символическое значение. Поскольку финансовые преступления крайне специфичны, сложны и технически емки, особенно важно, что благодаря этим ресурсам мы сможем усилить возможности следователей, прокуроров и судей эффективно рассматривать такие дела», - сказала канцлер Министерства юстиции и цифровых дел Тийна Уудеберг. «Показательно и то, что часть средств направляется непосредственно на профилактику, в том числе создается стратегическая рамка для предотвращения коррупции», - добавила она. Канцлер Министерства внутренних дел Тармо Мийлитс отметил, что дополнительные ресурсы позволят совершить важный рывок в расследовании технически сложных, как правило требующих международного сотрудничества и наносящих большой ущерб киберпреступлений. «Доходы от киберпреступности занимают высокое место рядом с оборотом наркотиков и коррупцией, поэтому особенно важно опережать преступников на шаг в навыках, знаниях и технических возможностях», - подчеркнул он. «Не менее важно выстроить устойчивую систему обучения, чтобы развитие компетенций в расследовании финансовых преступлений стало одним из столпов борьбы с преступностью. Совместно реализуемые проекты сделают работу правоохранительных органов эффективнее, чтобы поиск, арест и конфискация имущества, связанного с преступлениями, были результативнее, а снижение прибыльности преступной деятельности - успешнее», - указал Мийлитс. Министерство финансов акцентировало внимание на наращивании потенциала Финансовой инспекции по предотвращению отмывания денег. «Благодаря проектам у налоговой службы появится возможность получать сведения о транзакциях с криптоактивами, чтобы взыскивать неуплаченные налоги и обмениваться данными для выявления связанных преступлений», - сказала канцлер Министерства финансов Мерике Сакс. «Очень хорошо, что проекты предусматривают и информирование общества, и профилактику, например, чтобы люди не становились жертвами финансовых мошенничеств», - подчеркнула она.

Кроме того, средства будут использованы для повышения осведомлённости о финансовых и киберпреступлениях, а также для развития процедур по аресту и конфискации преступных доходов, в том числе в рамках международного сотрудничества. Соглашение также укрепляет сотрудничество между Эстонией и США в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями и демонстрирует, что обе страны совместно отстаивают принципы правового государства во всём мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов координирует комиссия, в которую входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел Эстонии, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом туре проектов было поддержано девять инициатив на общую сумму 25,7 миллиона евро. При отборе комиссия исходила из принципа, что проекты должны образовывать логически связанное целое и усиливать потенциал не только отдельных учреждений, но и системно укреплять борьбу с финансовыми преступлениями. Целью было обеспечить, чтобы проекты способствовали как профилактике, так и совершенствованию следственной практики, технологической поддержке и устойчивой системе обучения. Это поможет гарантировать, что в столь сложной сфере работают специалисты, хорошо осведомлённые о последних тенденциях, рисках и технологических изменениях, и способные эффективно применять полученные знания и навыки. Проекты направлены на предотвращение коррупции, повышение осведомлённости о финансовом мошенничестве, улучшение выявления, ареста и конфискации преступных доходов, укрепление возможностей по борьбе с киберпреступностью, повышение потенциала по выявлению и анализу криптодоходов, а также на усиление финансового надзора для более эффективной борьбы с отмыванием денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются Прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент государственной безопасности (КАПО), Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция, а также все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. _Читайте по теме:_ [**Цахкна: Передача штрафных денег доказывает глубину

Der Fall markiert einen tiefgreifenden Wendepunkt für die Anti-Money Laundry (AML)-Richtlinien im Bankensektor. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals offenbarte, dass Milliarden von Euro durch die estnische Filiale gewaschen wurden. Es stellte sich heraus, dass die vorhandenen AML-Kontrollmechanismen bei weitem nicht ausreichten, um derartige illegale Aktivitäten zu unterbinden. Diese Erkenntnis löste eine Compliance-Revolution aus, um ein künftiges Versagen der Systeme zu verhindern und die Integrität des Finanzmarktes zu wahren.** ## Die Enthüllung eines gigantischen Geldwäsche Netzwerkes Der Danske Bank Skandal verkörpert einen der gravierendsten Geldwäsche-Fälle innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors. Hohe Wellen schlug die Enthüllung, dass die estnische Filiale der Bank als Drehscheibe für dubiose Geldflüsse diente. Es entstand ein Bild verschlungener Transaktionskosten, deren Enden sich im Dunklen verloren. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals gab erste Hinweise darauf. Über die Jahre hinweg fanden Gelder in Höhe von mehr als 200 Milliarden Euro mit verdächtiger Herkunft ihren Weg durch das Finanzinstitut. Zwischen 2007 und 2015 fanden Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten statt. Diese Aktivitäten erfolgten über die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank. Ihr Umfang und ihre Komplexität wurden erst nach intensiven Ermittlungen vollends verstanden. Tausende verdächtige Transaktionen, die Milliarden von Dollar umfassten, wurden durchgeführt, ohne dass die erforderlichen AML-Kontrollen greifen konnten. * Die Affäre um die Danske Bank hat die Achillesferse der Finanzwelt blossgestellt: Effektive Mechanismen zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche sind nicht nur wünschenswert, sondern überlebenswichtig für die Integrität des gesamten Bankwesens. Die internen Sicherheitssysteme sollten in der Lage sein, solch massive Bewegungen zu identifizieren und zu melden. Bei der Danske Bank versagten diese jedoch auf ganzer Linie. Diese Erkenntnis trägt dazu bei, dass ein dringender Bedarf für eine tiefgreifende Transformation des Geldwäschebekämpfung Ansatzes im europäischen Bankensektor offengelegt wurde. * **Kennzeichnung undurchsichtiger Geldflüsse** * **Rollen Versäumnisse im internen Kontrollsystem** * **Überarbeitung von AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Richtlinien** Die Brisanz des Falles liegt unter anderem in der Beteiligung einer namhaften Bank: der Danske Bank. Diese sieht ihr Vertrauen bei Kundinnen und Kunden sowie innerhalb der Finanzwelt stark in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Der Fall zog eine detaillierte Untersuchung des Vorfalls nach sich. Dabei wurden die Unternehmenskultur und die Compliance-Struktur unter die Lupe genommen. Sie haben sich als unzureichend für das Management von Geldwäscherisiken erwiesen. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Bereich** | **Beschreibung** | **Konsequenz** | | Enthüllung | Unechte Kunden und verdächtige Geldflüsse | Stärkere AML-Vorgaben und Überwachung | | Finanzielles Volumen | Über 200 Milliarden Euro verdächtige Transfers | Untersuchungen und Strafen | | Kontrollsysteme | Versagen bei der Erkennung und Meldung | Bedenken zur Risikomanagement Infrastruktur | | Internationale Wirkung | Betrifft Reputation des gesamten Europäischen Bankensektors | Vertrauensverlust und Forderung nach Transparenz | ## ## Ausmass und Folgen der Geldwäsche-Affäre Nach dem Bekanntwerden der Geldwäsche-Affäre stehen die enorme Tragweite und die schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen im Fokus der Finanzwelt. Die aufgedeckten verdächtigen Transaktionen werfen ein Licht auf das bestehende Regulierung Defizit im Bankensektor und die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Geldwäschebekämpfung. ### Dimensionen des Skandals Die Dimensionen der Affäre sind erschütternd: Ein gigantisches Volumen an verdächtigen Geldtransaktionen blieb über Jahre hinweg unentdeckt. Dies zeigt, dass die Finanzaufsicht und die internen Kontrollmechanismen der betroffenen Institute versagt haben. Dies macht deutlich, dass es trotz existierender Vorschriften an einer konsequenten Umsetzung mangelte. ### Reaktionen der Finanzwelt und Regulatoren Die Antwort der Europäischen Zentralbank und der nationalen Finanzaufsichtsbehörden war ein Arsenal an Reaktionen. Ihre Massnahmen reichten von der Verschärfung der Regulierungsmassnahmen bis hin zur Diskussion über ethische Verantwortung im Finanzsektor. Diese Vorfälle haben zu einem Umdenken geführt. Es wurden neue Strategien im Kampf gegen die Geldwäsche entwickelt, um das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit wiederherzustellen. ### Wirtschaftliche und Reputationsschäden Der Reputationsschaden ist gewaltig. Die betroffene Bank hatte nicht nur mit Wertverlusten ihrer Aktien zu kämpfen. Sie stand ausserdem vor einer tiefgreifenden Vertrauenskrise, die die Glaubwürdigkeit des gesamten Sektors in Frage stellte. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Krise sind noch nicht vollständig absehbar. Jedoch ist klar, dass umfassende und nachhaltige Reformen notwendig sind. Diese Reformen sollen ähnliche Vorfälle in der Zukunft verhindern. ## ## AML-Anti Money Laundering: Grundsätze und Herausforderungen Die Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche, bekannt als Anti-Geldwäsche (AML), ist eine zentrale Säule im Finanzsektor. Sie dient dazu, die Integrität und Stabilität des Marktes zu gewährleisten. Banken und Finanzinstitutionen sind hierbei angehalten, strikte Compliance-Richtlinien zu befolgen, um Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten effizient aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Ein wirksames **Risikomanagement** spielt eine grundlegende Rolle in der AML-Compliance. Die Identifikation, Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken sind Schlüsselelemente, um nachhaltige Strategien gegen diese bedrohlichen Praktiken zu entwickeln. Due-Diligence-Verfahren, die sorgfältige Überprüfung von Geschäftspartnern, sind ebenfalls unerlässlich, um potenzielle Bedrohungen abzuwehren und den strengen regulatorischen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Grundprinzip** | **Herausforderungen** | **Strategien** | | Kundenidentifizierung ([KYC](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/partner-screening/?hsLang=de)) | Ineffizienz bei der Datenerhebung | Automatisierte Verifizierungssysteme | | [Transaction Monitoring](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-monitoring/?hsLang=de) | Falsch-Positive Meldungen | Verfeinerung von Algorithmen | | Due-Diligence-Verfahren | Mangel an Transparenz | Erweiterte Due-Diligence-Checks | | Meldung von Verdachtsfällen | Zeitgerechte Erfassung | Schulungen und klare Prozessabläufe | | Risikobewertung | Veränderliche Risikolandschaft | Dynamische Risikomodelle | Die Herausforderungen in der Anti-Geldwäsche sind vielfältig und komplex. Angesichts ständig ändernder Methoden der Geldwäsche müssen Finanzinstitutionen agil bleiben und ihre AML-Systeme kontinuierlich anpassen. Nicht nur das Aufspüren der Risiken spielt eine entscheidende Rolle. Die ganzheitlichen Compliance-Richtlinien sind ausschlaggebend, um zukünftige Skandale zu verhindern. Sie tragen dazu bei, das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in den Bankensektor zu stärken. ## Der europäische Kontext und die Rolle der Instant Payments Die Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten der Danske Bank haben die Verflechtungen innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors offengelegt. Es wird deutlich, dass Geldwäsche kein isoliertes Problem einer einzelnen Institution ist. Vielmehr stellt sie ein systemisches Risiko dar, das eine koordinierte Antwort auf europäischer und globaler Ebene erfordert. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die Rolle von Instant Payments zu betrachten. Diese beschleunigen einerseits den Zahlungsverkehr. Andererseits stellen sie neue Herausforderungen für die AML-Compliance dar. Die Integration von effektiven AML-Kontrollen in Instant Payment-Prozesse ist von entscheidender Bedeutung. ## Die Rolle von Technologie und Innovation bei der AML-Compliance Mit dem Aufkommen disruptiver Technologien hat sich die Herangehensweise an das Risikomanagement und die Einhaltung von Compliance-Vorschriften grundlegend gewandelt. Bei der Bekämpfung von Finanzverbrechen wie Geldwäsche avancieren Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und fortschrittliche AML-Technologien zu unverzichtbaren Instrumenten. Sie bieten nicht nur eine deutliche Effizienzsteigerung in den AML-Prozessen, sondern tragen erheblich zur Betrugserkennung und zur Prävention finanzieller Delikte bei. ## Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Geldwäschebekämpfung #### Schweiz In der Schweiz wird die Geldwäscherei durch folgende Gesetze und Verordnungen bekämpft: [Geldwäschereigesetz (GwG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/de): Das für Finanzintermediäre geltende Geldwäschereigesetz regelt die Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei und Terrorismusfinanzierung. Ausserdem regelt es die Sicherstellung der Sorgfalt bei Finanzgeschäften. Geldwäschereiverordnung (GwV): Die Vorschriften für die berufsmässige Ausübung der Tätigkeit als Finanzintermediär werden in dieser Verordnung geregelt. Ebenso sind die Aufsichts- und Meldepflichten für Händlerinnen und Händler darin festgelegt. [Geldwäschereiverordnung-FINMA](https://www.finma.ch/de/ueberwachung/branchenuebergreifende-themen/geldwaeschereibekaempfung/#:~:text=Aufsichtsrechtliche%20Geldw%C3%A4schereibek%C3%A4mpfung,im%20Rahmen%20ihrer%20prudenziellen%20Aufsicht.) (GWV-FINMA): Diese Verordnung legt fest, wie Finanzintermediäre die Pflichten zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umsetzen müssen. #### EU Geldwäscherichtlinie: Die Geldwäscherichtlinie der EU wurde 1991 erlassen und seitdem mehrmals überarbeitet. Die EU-Vorschriften dienen dazu, das Finanzsystem der EU zu schützen. Jedem EU-Mitgliedstaat obliegt es, die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie in nationales Recht umzusetzen. Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche: Im Juli 2021 legte die Europäische Kommission ein Paket mit Gesetzgebungsvorschlägen vor. Diese Vorschläge zielen auf die weitere Stärkung und bessere Durchsetzung der EU-Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AML/CFT) ab. Das Paket sieht vor, eine EU-Behörde zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche zu errichten, die einen Regelungsrahmen für Kredit- und Finanzinstitute schaffen soll. Ausserdem enthält das Paket Verordnungen über Verpflichtungen des privaten Sektors und eine überarbeitete Verordnung über Geldtransfers. #### Deutschland Geldwäschegesetz (GwG): Das deutsche Geldwäschegesetz ist die rechtliche Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinie von 2015 und zielt auf eine wirksame strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Geldwäschern ab. Es wurde mehrmals überarbeitet und ist in der aktuellen Fassung seit dem 02.07.2023 in Kraft. Strafgesetzbuch (StGB): Laut § 261 des deutschen StGB ist „Geldwäsche“ in Deutschland strafbewehrt. Personen, die unrechtmässig erworbene Vermögenswerte verschleiern, nutzen oder verbringen, machen sich strafbar. #### **Die Rolle von Aufsichtsbehörden** Aufsichtsbehörden wie die Schweizer Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FINMA) spielen bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei in der Schweiz eine zentrale Rolle. Ähnlich ist es mit der deutschen Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), die in Deutschland eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche einnimmt. Ihnen obliegt die Überwachung der Einhaltung der Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche bei Banken, Wertpapierhäusern und weiteren Finanzinstituten. Unabhängige Vermögensverwalter und Trustees werden in der Schweiz über die Aufsichtsbehörde (AO) indirekt überwacht. Daneben existieren hier Selbstregulierungsorganisationen (SRO), denen sich nicht prudentiell überwachte Finanzdienstleister anschliessen müssen. Die SROs werden wiederum von der FINMA genehmigt und beaufsichtigt. In Deutschland verfolgt die BaFin ebenfalls einen präventiven Ansatz zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Der Aufsichtsbehörde BaFin steht das im Oktober 2023 gegründete Bundesamt zur Bekämpfung von Finanzmarkt-Kriminalität (BBF) als Bundesoberbehörde zur Seite. In ihm werden Aufsicht, Analyse und strafrechtliche Ermittlung in Sachen Geldwäsche gebündelt. Die automatisierte Funktionalität dieses Tools bietet eine zeit- und ressourcenschonende Möglichkeit zur Risikoidentifizierung. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht es dem Compliance-Team, sich verstärkt auf das strategische Fallmanagement zu fokussieren. Diese Optimierung des Arbeitsablaufs gewährleistet eine effiziente Nutzung relevanter Ressourcen und Unternehmen halten gleichzeitig höchste Standards in Bezug auf Compliance und Risikoprävention aufrecht. ## Zukünftige Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung Die zunehmende Digitalisierung, wachsende globale Geldströme und Kryptowährungen stellen Anti-Money Laundering vor neue Herausforderungen. Da sich Geldwäsche als globales Problem darstellt, erfordert dies nicht nur eine Anpassung bestehender Kontrollmechanismen, sondern mehr internationale Zusammenarbeit. Neben der laufenden Anpassung von Gesetzen und Vorschriften gilt es, diese über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu harmonisieren. Um die Zusammenarbeit auf internationaler Ebene zu verstärken. Dies ist notwendig, weil die Methoden von Kriminellen raffinierter werden. Inzwischen setzen sie Kryptowährungen für Geldwäsche ein. Grosse Hoffnungen verbinden Behörden und Fahnder mit dem Einsatz neuer Methoden wie der Künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und Machine Learning bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung. Bei der Betrugserkennung und Aufdeckung von Anomalien bei Finanztransaktionen werden die neuen Technologien eine wichtige Rolle spielen. ## Fazit Die unheilvolle Geschichte des Danske Bank Skandals hat eine schockierende Wahrheit über den Bankensektor aufgedeckt. Sie hat aufgezeigt, welche gravierenden Konsequenzen mangelnde AML-Compliance nach sich zieht. Aus dieser Geldwäsche-Affäre sind zahlreiche Lektionen gezogen worden. Diese Lektionen betonen die Bedeutung von umfassenden Kontrollmechanismen und transparenten Finanzströmen. Banken stehen vor der Herausforderung, nicht bloss als Reaktion auf Skandale zu handeln. Vielmehr müssen sie als proaktives Element im Kampf gegen kriminelle Finanzaktivitäten agieren. Die Zukunft der AML-Compliance wird zunehmend von digitalen Innovationen und der Integration fortschrittlicher Technologien geprägt sein. Dies erfordert Investitionen in intelligente Lösungen, welche in der Lage sind, auch die raffiniertesten Verdachtsmomente zu identifizieren und zu analysieren. Das Streben nach einer lückenlosen Compliance-Kultur erzeugt eine steigende Nachfrage nach Fachkräften. Diese Fachkräfte müssen sowohl in der Analyse grosser Datenmengen geschult sein, als auch verstärkt in Beziehungsarbeit und Due-Diligence-Prüfung. In Anbetracht der Ereignisse rund um die Danske Bank ist die Notwendigkeit von dynamischen, anpassungsfähigen und international abgestimmten AML-Richtlinien offensichtlich. Die Wegbereiter für eine sichere Bankenwelt im 21. Jahrhundert sind Institute, die Transparenz und Integrität als Teil ihrer Unternehmensphilosophie betrachten. Sie sehen diese Werte nicht nur als gesetzliche Anforderung. Das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit kann durch das kollektive Bemühen aller Beteiligten wiederhergestellt werden. Gemeinsam kann der Sektor zukunftssichere Strukturen schaffen. Diese Strukturen müssen widerstandsfähig gegenüber den Bedrohungen durch Finanzkriminalität sein. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening als Lösung Das Pythagoras [Transaction Screening](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-screening/?hsLang=de) Modul ist die optimale Lösung für die Prüfung ein- und ausgehender Zahlungen.

The AMLA requires FinCEN to pay an award of [**up to 30 percent of collected monetary sanctions**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/money_laundering_whistleblower_reward/) that it recovers in a judicial or administrative action brought under the Bank Secrecy Act that results in sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The SEC can also **[pay awards to whistleblowers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/sec-whistleblower-program/)** for disclosing a broker-dealer’s failure to file [suspicious activity reports](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/report_reference.pdf), maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program, or establish an adequate customer identification program. In addition, the SEC can take an enforcement action against a mutual fund for a violation of Rule 38a-1, which requires investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws by the funds, which includes the Bank Secrecy Act.

In December 2022, [Danske Bank agreed to pay $413 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-220) to settle charges that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading investors about its AML compliance program in its Estonian branch and failing to disclose the risks posed by the program’s significant deficiencies. Danske Bank has agreed to pay more than $2 billion as part of an integrated, global resolution with the SEC, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Denmark’s Special Crime Unit. And in February 2018, [U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank paid $613 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/u-s-bancorp-agrees-to-pay-528-million-over-money-laundering) in fines and forfeitures to settle charges that it failed to maintain adequate safeguards against money laundering. In particular, U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious and processed Western Union transactions for non-customers. ## **SEC and FINRA Continue to Prioritize Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** The SEC’s [2024 examination priorities](https://www.sec.gov/files/2024-exam-priorities.pdf) clarify that the SEC continues to focus on AML compliance: > The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies, to establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs that are tailored to address the risks associated with the firm’s location, size, and activities, including the customers they serve, the types of products and services offered, and how those products and services are offered. These programs must, among other things, include policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the BSA and its implementing rules; independent testing; and risk-based procedures to perform customer due diligence (as required by the Customer Due Diligence rule), which includes identifying and verifying the identity of customers and conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. Where appropriate, certain financial institutions must also file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. SARs can be used to detect and combat market manipulation, insider trading, Ponzi schemes, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and a variety of other illicit activities potentially violative of securities and other laws and regulations. > > **The Division will continue to focus on AML programs to review whether broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies are: (1) appropriately tailoring their AML program to their business model and associated AML risks; (2) conducting independent testing; (3) establishing an adequate customer identification program, including for beneficial owners of legal entity customers; and (4) meeting their SAR filing obligations.** > **Examinations of certain registered investment companies will also review policies and procedures for oversight of applicable financial intermediaries. Also, the Division will review whether broker-dealers and advisers are monitoring** **Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and ensuring compliance with such sanctions.** # **Broker-Dealer Anti-Money Laundering Requirements** The primary [anti-money laundering regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.210) for brokers or dealers require, among other things, the establishment and implementation of an anti-money laundering program, which includes, at a minimum: * Policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance; * Independent testing for compliance; * Monitoring of the operations and internal controls of the program; * Ongoing training for appropriate persons; and * Appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, which includes: + Establishing, documenting, and maintaining a written [Customer Identification Program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.220); and + Continuous monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. In the event that a broker-dealer identifies a suspicious transaction, the firm is [required to file a SAR](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.320) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In the SAR’s narrative section, broker-dealers must “[p]rovide a clear, complete and chronological description . . . of the activity, including what is unusual, irregular or suspicious about the transactions(s).” Broker-dealers violate federal securities laws (specifically, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8) when they: * Fail to file SARs; or * File inaccurate SARs (e.g., incomplete narratives, incomplete critical field information, incomplete identification of suspicious activity, etc.). These violations deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information that could be used to identify potential securities law and money laundering violations. # **SEC and FINRA AML Enforcement Actions** * In September 2023, the SEC iharged registered investment adviser DWS Investment Management Americas Inc. (DIMA or DWS), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, for its failure to develop a mutual fund Anti-Money Laundering program. To settle the charges, DIMA agreed to pay a total of [$25 million in penalties](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-194). The SEC’s [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/ia-6431.pdf) also found that DIMA caused such mutual funds’ failure to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect activities indicative of money laundering and to conduct AML training specific to the mutual funds’ business. * In September 2023, the SEC charged a registered representative at a registered broker-dealer with [failing to report suspicious and unusual transactions in a brokerage account](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-98418-s) of his long-time customer to the AML group of the brokerage firm where he worked, which caused the firm to fail to timely file a SAR in violation of the federal securities laws. * In May 2016, FINRA fined Raymond James & Associates and Raymond James Financial Services **[$17 million](https://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/finra-fines-raymond-james-us17m-206217)** for widespread violations related to their anti-money laundering programs. The violations stemmed from the firms’ failure to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering programs, which in turn precluded the firms from meeting their duty to prevent, detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity from at least November 2011 through June 2014. * In December 2016, FINRA fined Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC [**$16.5 million**](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/CreditSuisse_AWC_120516.pdf?utm_source=MM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NewsRelease_120516_FINAL) for “significant deficiencies” in its anti-money laundering program. According to FINRA, Credit Suisse’s program failed to effectively monitor/detect suspicious trading and money movements from at least January 2011 through December 2015. As a result, Credit Suisse was unable to determine whether to file required SARs. * In January 2015, Oppenheimer & Company paid [**$10 million**](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/33-9711.pdf) to settle an action by the SEC and FinCEN for failure to file SARs. According to the SEC’s complaint, Oppenheimer’s anti-money laundering program identified suspicious activity that needed to be “escalated” immediately. Specifically, the activity stemmed from an account that: “(i) was a foreign broker-dealer doing business in the U.S.; (ii) selling ‘low-priced stock’ on behalf of customers; and (iii) that it immediately wired the proceeds out of the Oppenheimer account.” Despite these and other red flags, Oppenheimer failed to file SARs with FinCEN. * In February 2016, the SEC fined E.S. Financial Services [**$1 million**](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-23.html) for violating anti-money laundering laws by “allowing foreign entities to buy and sell securities without verifying the identities of the non-U.S. citizens who beneficially owned them.” As mentioned, federal securities laws require broker-dealers to establish, document, and maintain a written Customer Identification Program. ## **SEC AML Enforcement** In a July 2023 Risk Alert, EXAMS staff observed certain weaknesses in OFAC compliance programs, including instances in which entities did not adopt or implement reasonable, risk-based internal controls for 1. following-up on potential matches with the sanctions lists and documenting the outcome of such follow-up; 2. performing periodic or event-based screening of existing clients or customers based on, among other things, changes in ownership or to the sanctions lists; and 3. conducting OFAC searches in a timely manner (or documenting that such searches were completed). The alert encourages registrants to review and strengthen the policies, procedures, and internal controls of their AML programs to further their compliance with federal AML rules and regulations, and to monitor for amendments, pursuant to the AMLA and the Corporate Transparency Act.

According to the SEC’s [complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-112.pdf), Alpine failed to adequately file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for at least 1,950 stock transactions that the firm flagged as suspicious. The SEC found that Alpine’s “records contained information reflecting material red flags of money laundering, securities fraud, or other illicit financial activities relating to its customers and their transactions,” and that Alpine “routinely and systematically failed to identify and report suspicious activity in its SAR filings.” The SEC charged Alpine with thousands of violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8, and sought an order requiring Alpine to pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, which provides for penalties ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 for each violation The SEC’s complaint reveals that the SEC also charged many of Alpine’s customers with federal securities laws violations, including violations relating to transactions that cleared through Alpine. ## **SEC Whistleblower Program Pays More than $1.8 Billion in Awards to Whistleblowers** In 2010, Congress created the [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) to “motivate those with inside knowledge to come forward and assist the Government to identify and prosecute persons who have violated securities laws and recover money for victims of financial fraud,” S.

The [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) has enabled the SEC to uncover significant investment fraud schemes and halt ongoing fraud.

About Battle Over Corporate Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/whistleblower-attorney-jason-zuckerman-quoted-battle-corporate-whistleblower-rules/) In 2020, the SEC announced that “Anti-Money Laundering” was on the agency’s [List of Examination Priorities](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/national-examination-program-priorities-2020.pdf). The SEC’s examination priorities “reflect certain practices, products, and services that [SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations] perceives to present potentially heightened risk to investors and/or the integrity of the U.S. capital markets.” In the priority list, the SEC clarifies that it will continue to scrutinize broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs by: * Examining the appropriateness and effectiveness of broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs; * Reviewing how broker-dealers are monitoring for suspicious activity; and * Assessing broker-dealers’ compliance with SAR requirements. In 2016, the SEC [announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/inside-the-national-exam-program-in-2016.html) that it would share more of its oversight responsibilities of the broker-dealer industry with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Since 2017, and in lockstep with the SEC, FINRA included “Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity Monitoring” on its [2020 Annual Regulatory and Examination Priorities Letter](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/communications-firms/2020-risk-monitoring-and-examination-priorities-letter). Both the SEC and FINRA have increased enforcement actions against broker-dealers for anti-money laundering program violations. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)(2) (the “SAR Rule”). Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. Id. Exchange Act Rule 17a-8 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission to comply with the reporting, record-keeping, and record retention requirements of the BSA. The failure to timely file a SAR as required by the SAR Rule is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act. * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=linkedin) * [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=twitter) * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=facebook) * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=tumblr) Categories: [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-program/), [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Protection Law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-protection-law/), [Money Laundering Whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [SEC Whistleblower Attorney](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-attorney/), [SEC Whistleblower Award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower cases](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-cases/), [SEC whistleblower lawyers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/), [SEC Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-program/), [SEC Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-rules/), [Uncategorized](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/uncategorized/), [Whistleblower Bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounties/), [whistleblower bounty](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounty/), [Whistleblower Rewards](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-rewards/) Tags: [AML compliance whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-compliance-whistleblower/), [AML whistleblower lawyer](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-whistleblower-lawyer/), [AMLA whistleblower law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/amla-whistleblower-law/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-bounties/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower reward program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-reward-program/), [anti-money laundering whistleblowing](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblowing/), [broker dealer fraud whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/broker-dealer-fraud-whistleblower/), [money laundering whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [reporting money laundering to SEC](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/reporting-money-laundering-to-sec/), [sec whistleblower award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-program/), [sec whistleblower rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-rules/) ### About the authors Matthew Stock is the Director of the Whistleblower Rewards Practice at Zuckerman Law.

Alors que les régulateurs financiers du monde entier ne cessent de souligner l'importance des protocoles AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CRS (Common Reporting Standard) et FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), certaines institutions commettent des erreurs, intentionnelles ou non, et s'exposent à des conséquences bien plus terrifiantes que prévu. Ces réglementations sont conçues pour assurer la sécurité, la transparence et la résistance du secteur financier aux activités illicites telles que le blanchiment d'argent, l'évasion fiscale et le financement du terrorisme. Cependant, la non-conformité entraîne souvent de lourdes sanctions pécuniaires, des perturbations opérationnelles et le spectre effrayant de la ruine de la réputation. Ce billet explore quelques-uns des exemples les plus alarmants d'institutions hantées par les coûts « effrayants » des manquements à la conformité et explique pourquoi le fait de donner la priorité au respect de la réglementation peut vous éviter une frayeur inattendue. ### Violations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent (LAB) constituent la première défense du secteur financier contre le blanchiment d'argent, le financement du terrorisme et d'autres activités économiques criminelles. Les réglementations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent obligent les institutions financières à mettre en œuvre des procédures rigoureuses, notamment des protocoles de connaissance du client (KYC), des systèmes de surveillance et des rapports sur les activités suspectes. En appliquant ces réglementations, des autorités comme le FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) aux États-Unis et divers régulateurs financiers européens visent à empêcher les criminels d'intégrer des fonds illicites dans le système financier légitime. Pourtant, malgré ces protocoles stricts, de nombreuses institutions ont connu des défaillances qui leur ont coûté cher en termes de finances et de réputation. Certaines des amendes les plus célèbres du secteur en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent rappellent ce qui peut se produire lorsque la diligence raisonnable n'est pas respectée. #### 1. HSBC – Un rappel de 1,9 milliard de dollars sur la négligence en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Dans le cadre de l'une des plus importantes amendes infligées en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, HSBC a été condamnée en 2012 à une pénalité stupéfiante de 1,9 milliard de dollars pour avoir enfreint les lois relatives à la lutte contre le blanchiment. Elle n'avait notamment pas mis en place de contrôles efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et avait traité des transactions pour des cartels de la drogue au Mexique et d'autres clients à haut risque. Le ministère américain de la justice, en collaboration avec le FinCEN et d'autres agences, a mené l'enquête, qui a mis au jour de graves lacunes en matière de diligence raisonnable à l'égard des clients, des contrôles internes inadéquats et des systèmes de surveillance médiocres. La négligence de HSBC a permis à des criminels de faire transiter des milliards de dollars par ses systèmes sans éveiller de soupçons. Les conséquences ont été terribles pour HSBC. Outre le coup financier, l'institution a dû faire face à une surveillance publique intense, à des batailles juridiques et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Elle a été contrainte de revoir ses procédures de conformité, d'investir des millions dans des technologies de conformité et d'embaucher des milliers de responsables de la conformité. Le nom de la banque, autrefois synonyme de fiabilité, a été associé à l'un des plus grands scandales de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent du secteur - une réputation obsédante qui a perduré longtemps après la sanction. #### 2. Danske Bank – Une toile de milliards blanchis Le scandale de blanchiment d'argent de la Danske Bank est un autre exemple notoire. Entre 2007 et 2015, la succursale estonienne de Danske aurait blanchi environ 230 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes, provenant principalement de clients russes. Bien que le scandale ait été rendu public en 2018, l'amende infligée par les régulateurs danois a rappelé le coût élevé des défaillances en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent. L'enquête a révélé que la banque ne disposait pas de contrôles suffisants, ce qui a permis à un réseau de criminels d'exploiter ses systèmes pour effectuer des transactions illicites. Les autorités de régulation danoises et estoniennes, ainsi que plusieurs organismes internationaux, ont jugé que la banque était complice de l'un des plus grands systèmes de blanchiment d'argent en Europe. Les répercussions ne se sont pas limitées à des amendes ; la Danske Bank a dû faire face à des poursuites judiciaires, à la contestation des actionnaires et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Des cadres supérieurs ont démissionné et la réputation de la banque a été fortement entamée, jetant une longue ombre sur ses opérations et ses relations avec les clients. Ce scandale a mis en évidence les dangers liés à la faiblesse des systèmes de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, illustrant comment le non-respect des protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent peut entraîner des dommages financiers et des atteintes à la réputation considérables. #### Analyse des manquements à la conformité : Les pièges courants de la lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les exemples de HSBC et de Danske Bank mettent en évidence les pièges les plus courants en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent : - Diligence insuffisante à l'égard des clients : Des clients insuffisamment contrôlés peuvent exploiter les systèmes financiers à des fins de blanchiment d'argent. - Faiblesse des contrôles internes : L'absence de cadres solides de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et de gestion des risques expose les institutions à l'exploitation criminelle. - Systèmes de surveillance inefficaces : En l'absence de suivi des transactions en temps réel et de détection des anomalies, les activités suspectes peuvent passer inaperçues. Dans les deux cas, l'absence de mesures de conformité et l'absence d'une culture de la conformité ont amplifié l'impact. Lorsque les institutions négligent le respect de la réglementation, elles s'exposent involontairement à des amendes substantielles et à des poursuites judiciaires. ### Sanctions et montages offshore La conformité financière est semée d'embûches coûteuses, en particulier en ce qui concerne les violations des sanctions et l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger. Les sanctions pour non-conformité dans ces domaines sont parmi les plus sévères, car les organismes de réglementation du monde entier appliquent des sanctions strictes pour dissuader les institutions financières de contourner les lois économiques ou de soutenir des activités illicites. Les sanctions américaines jouent un rôle essentiel dans la sauvegarde de la sécurité nationale en limitant les transactions financières avec les pays impliqués dans le terrorisme ou les violations des droits de l'homme. Les banques qui ignorent ou tentent de contourner ces restrictions s'exposent à de graves conséquences économiques et à des atteintes à leur réputation. #### 3. BNP Paribas - Une pénalité record de 8,9 milliards de dollars pour violation des sanctions En 2014, BNP Paribas (BNPP), l'une des plus grandes institutions financières françaises, a reçu une amende record de 8,9 milliards de dollars après avoir plaidé coupable d'avoir traité des transactions pour le Soudan, l'Iran et Cuba, des pays soumis à des sanctions américaines strictes. Cette amende massive a mis en lumière les conséquences de la conspiration pluriannuelle de la BNPP visant à contourner les lois américaines sur les sanctions et les stratagèmes élaborés par la banque pour éviter d'être détectée.La BNPP a utilisé des « banques satellites » et des entités sanctionnées déguisées dans des transactions pour contourner les sanctions, faisant transiter plus de 8,8 milliards de dollars par le système américain. Malgré les avertissements juridiques, la banque a poursuivi ces pratiques à des fins lucratives, notamment en soutenant des banques soudanaises liées au terrorisme. Cette situation a eu des répercussions importantes, notamment des amendes imposées par le ministère de la justice, la Réserve fédérale et l'OFAC, des poursuites pénales et une suspension d'un an des opérations de compensation en dollars. La BNPP a également dû licencier des cadres supérieurs et investir massivement dans des réformes de conformité. #### 4. Credit Suisse - Systèmes d'évasion fiscale offshore et pénalité de 1,8 milliard de dollars Le Crédit Suisse, une banque suisse à l'histoire mouvementée, a été impliqué dans l'aide apportée à des contribuables américains pour leur permettre d'échapper à l'impôt en dissimulant des actifs sur des comptes offshore. En 2014, la banque a plaidé coupable à une accusation de complot pour avoir aidé des clients américains à dissimuler leur fortune, ce qui lui a valu une amende de 1,8 milliard de dollars. Cette affaire a relancé l'examen mondial du rôle des banques suisses dans la facilitation de l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger et de l'efficacité des accords de plaidoyer pour prévenir les violations répétées.Un rapport de la commission des finances du Sénat a révélé que le Crédit suisse n'avait peut-être pas respecté l'accord qu'il avait conclu, en mettant en évidence les services qu'il avait rendus à des personnalités de premier plan comme Dan Horsky, qui avait dissimulé 220 millions de dollars par l'intermédiaire de membres de sa famille et de sociétés écrans. Des documents internes montrent que des banquiers chevronnés ont modifié les détails des comptes pour échapper à la surveillance de l'IRS en utilisant la double nationalité pour masquer l'identité des clients. Le rapport a également mis au jour des comptes non divulgués transférés vers d'autres banques, ce qui a suscité des appels en faveur d'une intensification des enquêtes sur le Credit Suisse et d'autres banques suisses. Ces révélations ont entaché la réputation du Credit Suisse et relancé la demande d'une application plus stricte de la FATCA et de la réglementation sur les déclarations à l'étranger, notamment en ce qui concerne les comptes à double nationalité et l'évasion fiscale. #### Les défis de la conformité : Pourquoi les institutions se débattent-elles avec les sanctions et les réglementations offshore ? La conformité aux sanctions et aux réglementations offshore est complexe pour les institutions financières, car elle exige des contrôles, une surveillance et des rapports rigoureux. Les défis à relever sont les suivants :- Contrôle des transactions : Un contrôle efficace est nécessaire pour empêcher les fonds d'atteindre les entités figurant sur la liste noire. Les tactiques de dissimulation de BNP Paribas mettent en évidence les risques de détection des pratiques occultes.- Questions relatives aux données sur les clients : La conformité offshore nécessite une identification précise des clients, en particulier pour les personnes ayant une double nationalité. La situation du Crédit Suisse a révélé des problèmes liés à une déclaration inadéquate de ces comptes.- Coordination transfrontalière : Les institutions doivent s'aligner sur les différentes réglementations mondiales et locales, comme l'a montré le Credit Suisse en gérant les protocoles de conformité entre les différentes juridictions.Les sanctions infligées à BNP Paribas et au Crédit Suisse montrent les graves conséquences des manquements à la conformité, et soulignent la nécessité d'une approche proactive de la conformité pour atténuer les risques financiers et les risques pour la réputation. ### Conclusion #### Éviter les coûts effrayants des violations de la conformité Les amendes faramineuses et les atteintes à la réputation constatées dans des affaires comme celles de HSBC, Danske Bank, BNP Paribas et Credit Suisse révèlent les enjeux considérables de la conformité financière. Ces histoires édifiantes rappellent aux institutions que les manquements en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, de sanctions ou de réglementations offshore sont coûteux et laissent une ombre durable sur la crédibilité d'une institution et la confiance de ses clients. Avec l'augmentation de la surveillance réglementaire et de la responsabilité publique, la conformité ne peut plus être considérée comme une simple fonction d'arrière-guichet - c'est un élément vital de l'intégrité opérationnelle et de la réussite stratégique.Les institutions financières doivent donner la priorité à des cadres de conformité rigoureux, investir dans des systèmes de contrôle de pointe et instaurer une culture de la responsabilité dans l'ensemble de leurs opérations. Ces mesures proactives sont essentielles pour éviter les conséquences « effrayantes » qui ont hanté d'autres acteurs du secteur. En s'engageant à respecter scrupuleusement les règles de conformité, les institutions se protègent contre de graves répercussions financières et juridiques et préservent leur réputation sur un marché mondial où la confiance et la transparence sont indispensables. #### Share: ### TWC Staff ### Related News [Conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/conformité) ### [08 | Simplifier la conformité dans les îles Caïmans](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [Article](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/article) ### [Fortnite: les achats dans le jeu et les violations de la vie privée entraînent des amendes massives](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [Blog](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/blog) ### [Briser les barrières : les femmes qui ouvrent la voie dans le domaine de la conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr)\", summary=\"Danske Bank was involved in a major money laundering scandal, where its Estonian branch allegedly laundered approximately $230 billion in suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015, mainly from Russian clients.

[Liberty Reserve](#headline_15) Finance UA Обновлено 11 июля 2024 Отмывание денег имеет серьезные далеко идущие негативные последствия для экономики, общества и целостности финансовой системы. Это уже давно глобальная проблема, которая угрожает финансовым системам и способствует росту преступной деятельности. По данным МВФ, уровень отмывания денег составляет 2−5% мирового ВВП. В причастности к таким действиям в последние годы были уличены известные банки, политики, знаменитости и компании. ## Что такое отмывание денег Прежде всего, разберемся подробнее, что означает отмывание денег. Это преступление, связанное с сокрытием или попыткой скрыть незаконное происхождение полученных средств. В рамках этого процесса человек или учреждение превращает незаконные средства в законные через сложные каналы. Деньги проходят различные этапы, включая конвертацию и перевод в официально признанное учреждение. Например, человек получил деньги путем преступной деятельности (мошенничество, торговля наркотиками, контрабанда оружия, терроризм и т. п.), а затем вливает эти средства на официальный рынок. Как это он делает? Покупает недвижимость, транспортные средства, компании и т. д., таким образом превращая их происхождение в законное. Тот, кто отмывает деньги, обходит финансовую систему страны и манипулирует ею, чтобы вводить и тратить неправомерно полученные деньги. Рассмотрим 5 громких историй с отмыванием денег, которые стали известны в последние годы и получили международный резонанс. ## «Панамские документы» Утечка «Панамских документов» (Panama Papers) в 2016 году стала монументальным разоблачением, которое обнародовало многочисленные резонансные случаи отмывания денег, уклонение от уплаты налогов и обход международных санкций. Утечка информации касалась банков, юридических фирм и чиновников во всем мире, раскрывая масштабы незаконной финансовой деятельности, скрытой через оффшорные банки и подставные компании. «Панамские документы» — это история с утечкой зашифрованных конфиденциальных документов, которые были собственностью панамской юридической фирмы Mossack Fonseca, специализирующейся на работе с оффшорами. Эти документы в апреле 2016 года опубликовала немецкая газета Süddeutsche Zeitung, назвав их «панамскими документами». Таким образом удалось разоблачить сеть из более 214 тыс. налоговых гаваней, в которые были привлечены люди и организации из 200 разных стран. В центре этих историй стоит Mossack Fonseca — панамский поставщик оффшорных компаний с десятками офисов по всему миру. Компания продает свои оболочки фирм в таких городах как Цюрих, Лондон и Гонконг. Mossack Fonseca является посредником для тех, кто хочет зарегистрировать компанию в «налоговом раю» и пользоваться льготами. Mossack Fonseca тесно сотрудничала с такими финансовыми гигантами как HSBC, Deutsche Bank и Credit Suisse, чтобы помочь их клиентам скрыть свои средства. Так, клиенты Mossack Fonseca могли приобрести анонимную компанию всего за 1 тыс. долларов. Но за эту цену можно получить просто пустую оболочку. За дополнительную плату Mossack Fonseca предоставляла фиктивного директора и при желании скрывала настоящего акционера компании. В результате возникает оффшорная компания, чья подлинная цель и структура собственности зашифрована извне. ### Кто из известных людей «засветился» в «Панамских документах»? **Бывший премьер-министр Исландии Сигмундюр Гюннлейгссон** Как выяснили журналисты, Гюннлейгссон прятал миллионы долларов инвестиций исландских банков в оффшорных компаниях. Согласно документам, Гюннлейгссон и его жена купили оффшорную компанию Wintris в 2007 году, однако не указали ее в декларации. В 2010 году исландский премьер продал 50% компании Wintris своей жене за 1 доллар. **Бывший премьер-министр Грузии Бидзина Иванишвили** Иванишвили скрыл от налоговой тот факт, что владеет компанией Lynden Management Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах, не зафиксировав ее ни в одной декларации. Через эту компанию Иванишвили и его партнеры контролировали около 20% акций американской фармацевтической компании Raptor Pharmaceuticals. **Бывший премьер-министр Иордании Али Абу Рагеб** Журналисты обнаружили, что за несколько месяцев до истечения своего срока в должности премьера Рагеб зарегистрировал оффшорную компанию Jaar Investment Ltd, открывшую счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. Кроме того, политик вместе с супругой стал директором Jay Investment Holdings Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. До декабря 2014 года Рагебу принадлежали три компании на Сейшельских островах, а его дети были привлечены как директора в нескольких других компаниях, в частности Desert Star Investment Capital Ltd, которая имела счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. **Бывший вице-президент Ирака Ияд Аллави** Согласно расследованию, в 1985 году Аллави зарегистрировал через Mossack Fonseca компанию I.M.F. Holdings Inc. В 2013 году общая стоимость ее активов составила 1,5 млрд долларов. Еще одна компания, которую Аллави не указал в своей декларации — Moonlight Estates Limited. **Отец бывшего премьер-министра Великобритании Дэвида Кэмерона** Покойный отец бывшего британского премьера Дэвида Кэмерон Иен Кэмерон помогал создать и развивать оффшорную компанию Blairmore Holdings Inc в 1982 году и был вовлечен в ее деятельность вплоть до своей смерти в 2010-м. В 1998 году Blairmore была оценена в 20 млн долларов. **Президент Азербайджана Ильхам Алиев** Алиев и его супруга в 2003 году купили компанию Rosamund International Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. Тогда Алиев был депутатом парламента, а позже вступил в должность президента. Следовательно, политик, указанный директором и совладельцем Rosamund International Ltd, нарушил закон, запрещающий президенту заниматься бизнесом. В 2008 году две дочери Алиева приобрели компании Arbor Investments, LaBelleza Holdings Limited и Harvard Management Limited. Директором этих трех фирм оказался предприниматель Хасан Гозал. Он вместе со своим братом Абдолбары владел десятью компаниями, входящими в холдинг Intersun, где Абдолбары был президентом, а Хассан — вице-президентом. Таким образом, холдинг Intersun получил несколько крупных контрактов от государственной нефтяной компании Азербайджана, где Алиев еще до главы государства был первым вице-президентом. **Король Саудовской Аравии Салман ибн Абдул-Азиз Аль Сауд** Согласно «Панамским архивам», через оффшорные компании король Саудовской Аравии владел яхтой и недвижимостью в Лондоне, которую оценили в 34 млн долларов. На имя монарха зарегистрирован ряд компаний, в том числе Safason Corporation SA SPF, Verse Development Corporation, InRow Corporation, Crassus Limited и Park Property Limited. **Футболист Лионель Месси** Согласно обнародованным данным, Месси и его отцу принадлежит оффшорная компания Mega Star Enterprises, зарегистрированная в Панаме. Впервые она была упомянута в архивах Mossack Fonseca еще 13 июня 2013 года. На следующий день испанская прокуратура выдвинула против обеих Месси обвинения в многомиллионных налоговых махинациях. **Ближайшее окружение российского диктатора владимира путина** В «Панамских архивах» были упомянуты четыре компании, связанные с россией — Sonnette Overseas, International Media Overseas, Sunbarn и Sandalwood Continental. Все они были зарегистрированы в оффшорах через Mossack Fonseca и связаны с окружением путина. Так, International Media Overseas и Sonnette Overseas принадлежали близкому другу диктатора россии виолончелисту Сергею Ролдугину. В расследовании также упоминаются оффшорные компании спикера диктатора рф Дмитрия пескова, министра экономического развития Алексея Улюкаева, сына российского олигарха и друга путина Игоря Ротенберга, и других российских политиков. Выведенная ими в оффшоры сумма на 2016 год могла достигать 2 млрд долларов. ## «Райские документы» В ноябре 2017 года журналисты Международного консорциума журналистских расследований (ICIJ) обнародовали данные тайных документов о налоговых лазейках и бизнес-контактах чиновников из 50 стран мира, в том числе и Украины. Эта утечка получила название «Райские документы» (Paradise Papers) и содержала данные госреестров полутора десятков экзотических островов, где регистрируют оффшорные компании. Речь идет о 13,4 млн финансовых документов с данными о том, как богатейшие люди и компании мира тайно вкладывают деньги в оффшорные зоны, чтобы «защититься» от налогов или сохранить секретность деловых соглашений. В материалах, охватывающих период с 1950-го по 2016 год, фигурируют имена более 120 мировых политиков. Среди самых громких имен в документах — покойная королева Великобритании Елизавета II, а также корпорации, такие как Nike, Apple и Facebook. Большая часть материала, а именно 6,8 млн документов, касается деятельности юридической фирмы Appleby, действовавшей в 10 различных юрисдикциях. Но в другой части речь идет об оффшорах корпораций, спортсменов и политиков во всем мире. **Королева Британии Елизавета II** По данным из «Райских документов», около 10 млн фунтов стерлингов из частного состояния королевы Елизаветы II были инвестированы в оффшоры. Деньги в фонды на Каймановых островах и Бермудах вкладывало Герцогство Ланкастерское, что обеспечивало королеву доходами и управляло инвестициями в пределах ее частной собственности в 500 млн фунтов стерлингов. **российский предприниматель Юрий Мильнер** «Райские документы» обнаружили «кремлевский след» в компаниях Facebook Inc. и Twitter Inc. По данным расследователей, один из важных инвесторов обеих компаний — фонд DST Global, принадлежащий российскому миллиардеру Юрию Мильнеру, был финансово связан с российскими госкомпаниями. Так, на деньги, полученные от ВТБ Банка, фонд Мильнера приобрел в 2011 году акции Twitter. Инвестиции же в Facebook фонда DST Global фактически профинансировала дочерняя компания «Газпрома» — «Газпром инвестхолдинг», которую возглавлял тогда бизнесмен Алишер Усманов. Мильнер и партнеры продали свои акции Facebook и Twitter в 2012 и 2013 годах. **Бывший министр торговли США Уилбур Росс** По данным документов, бывший американский министр через серию оффшоров имел долю в компании Navigator, тесно сотрудничавшей с газовой компанией Sibur. Совладельцем Sibur был муж дочери путина. **Apple** Благодаря некоторым особенностям законодательства в оффшорах Apple несколько лет не платила миллиарды налогов. В частности, до 2014 года компания использовала лазейку в налоговом законодательстве США и Ирландии, известную как double Irish. Это схема оптимизации налоговых обязательств посредством использования двух ирландских и одной нидерландской компаний. Она позволила Apple постоянно производить продажу за пределами Северной и Южной Америки — а это почти 55% дохода — через ирландские дочерние компании, которые фактически были оффшорами. Таким образом, компания не платила никаких налогов. **Nike** Компания снижала налоговые ставки через свой филиал в Нидерландах. Схема работала таким образом: когда человек покупал товар, например, в Лондоне, то деньги за него уходили в главную британскую дочернюю компанию Nike. Затем денежные средства поступали в Нидерланды, где расположена штаб-квартира компании. В течение 2005−2014 годов компания могла перечислять деньги оттуда на Бермуды, где зарегистрирована ее «дочка» — Nike International Ltd. ## Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank Крупнейший банк Дании Danske Bank был замешан в масштабном скандале с отмыванием денег, связанном с подозрительными транзакциями примерно на 200 млрд евро через эстонский филиал. Скандал возник в 2018 году после раскрытия изоблачителем в эстонском отделении Danske, который сообщил, что банк проигнорировал признаки, указывающие на «потенциально преступные операции» по перемещению миллиардов долларов на Запад с 2008 по 2017 годы, в том числе от российских клиентов. Многие клиенты банка были компаниями с признаками фиктивности, зарегистрированными в Великобритании. Датская юридическая фирма Bruun&Hjejle провела проверку Danske Bank и пришла к выводу, что сотрудники банка сознательно могли быть соучастниками нелегальных операций. Также в банке не контролировалось отмывание денег, там не знали владельцев многих счетов и не имели автоматического мониторинга входных транзакций. Более того, банк даже не выяснял, находятся ли клиенты под санкциями. В 2022 году Danske Bank признал себя виновным в сговоре с целью совершения банковского мошенничества. Признал, что предоставлял банковские услуги подозрительным клиентам — в том числе и в стране-агрессоре — через свой эстонский филиал, хотя знал о рисках отмывания денег. ## Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом Американский политтехнолог, экс-глава избирательной кампании Дональда Трампа — Пол Манафорт был разоблачен и осужден за отмывание средств, полученных за работу консультантом украинской Партии регионов, ее лидера и экс-президента Украины Виктора Януковича, а также Оппозиционного блока. Манафорт вместе с коллегой Ричардом Гейтсом в период с 2006 по 2015 годы заработали в Украине десятки миллионов долларов. С целью скрыть эти деньги, они в течение 2006−2016 годов отмывали средства через многочисленные компании, партнерства и банки в США и других странах. Манафорт и Гейтс действовали как агенты правительства Украины, Партии регионов, Януковича, не задекларировав в США эту деятельность и заработанные вследствие нее средства должным образом. Заметим, что по американскому законодательству такая деятельность является лоббированием в пользу иностранного государства и требует государственной регистрации. По подозрениям ФБР, Манафорт получил от «Партии регионов» и от россии 80−100 млн долларов. По данным обвинения, политтехнолог использовал миллионы долларов незадекларированных и не облагаемых налогом средств для роскошной жизни и покупки дорогой недвижимости в США. То же делал и Гейтс, также помогавший Манафорту получать эти средства с оффшорных счетов. В общей сложности через эти оффшорные счета прошло более 75 млн долларов. В обвинительном акте Манафорта были перечислены десятки компаний, созданных им вместе с Гейтсом, и сотни денежных переводов от этих компаний в пользу обоих деятелей, использованные в их схеме. В марте 2019 года Манафорт был приговорен почти к 4 годам тюрьмы за мошенничество, а впоследствии — еще к 3,5 годам за отмывание денег, препятствование правосудию и несообщение о лоббистской работе. В том же году международная журналистская организация OCCRP установила, что Янукович и Манафорт принимали участие в отмывании средств через Swedbank. Янукович вывел с помощью банка минимум 3,6 млн долларов. ## Liberty Reserve Основанная в США компания Liberty Reserve была аналогом платежной системы PayPal, но для тех, у кого нет счета в банке. В рекламе компания называла себя «самой большой системой платежей и денежных переводов». Впоследствии федеральные прокуроры назвали Liberty Reserve одной из самых крупных в истории «прачечных» для отмывания денег. Согласно судебным документам, компания отмыла в общей сложности около 8 млрд долларов. Принцип работы Liberty Reserve был такой: 1. Для создания учетной записи не требуется никакой информации, кроме адреса электронной почты. 2. Чтобы положить деньги на счет, нужно купить местную валюту через обменник в интернете. 3. За перевод денег со счета в Liberty Reserve на счет в другой системе компания получает 1% от суммы транзакции. За дополнительные 75 центов можно было купить анонимный перевод — сервис открыл номер кошелька, из которого поступал перевод. Анонимность платежей в Liberty Reserve привлекла кардеров (угонщиков данных с **[кредитных карт](https://finance.ua/cards/credit-a)**. — Ред.), продавцов нелегальных данных, организаторов финансовых пирамид и других, кто вел не совсем честный бизнес. Однако среди аккаунтов владельцев в Liberty Reserve были и добросовестные пользователи. В общей сложности в платежной системе было зарегистрировано около 5 млн аккаунтов. Основатель Liberty Reserve — бывший киевлянин Артур Будовский — в 2016 году был приговорен к 20 годам заключения. Суд признал его виновным в использовании компании для проведения огромной многонациональной операции по отмыванию денег. Прокурор Прит Бхарара назвал Liberty Reserve «банком преступного мира». Для тех, кто зарабатывает свои деньги нелегально, отмывание средств является необходимым способом избежать уголовного преследования, тратя в то же время свои нелегальные доходы. Но эта многоуровневая финансовая схема часто приводит к краху, поскольку огромные суммы денег никогда не остаются тайной надолго.

The scandal came to light in 2018 after a whistleblower revealed that Danske Bank ignored signs of potentially criminal operations moving billions of dollars to the West from 2008 to 2017, including from Russian clients. Many clients were shell companies registered in the UK. An investigation by Danish law firm Bruun&Hjejle found that Danske Bank employees may have knowingly participated in illegal activities, and the bank failed to control money laundering, did not know the owners of many accounts, and lacked automated transaction monitoring. In 2022, Danske Bank admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, acknowledging that it provided banking services to suspicious clients through its Estonian branch despite being aware of money laundering risks.', claim_type='conviction', date_published='2024-07-11', hyde_score=0.43),\n",

How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank?](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/danske-bank-case-money-laundering-scandal-1130#how-modern-tools-prevent-cases-like-danske-bank) Between 2007 and 2015, the global financial system faced one of the most significant [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/anti-money-laundering-aml-49) failures in modern history, in which Danske Bank ([Denmark](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-denmark-245)’s largest financial institution) was implicated in a [money laundering](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/money-laundering-122) scandal amounting to over $230 billion in suspicious transactions. This scandal occurred around the bank’s Estonian branch. It both exposed critical compliance lapses and reshaped how financial institutions and regulators approach AML globally. What Was the Danske Bank Money Laundering Scandal? -------------------------------------------------- Over an eight-year period, suspicious transactions worth over $230 billion flowed predominantly from countries that are outside the EU such as [Russia](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-russia-127), [Azerbaijan](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-azerbaijan-159), and Moldova. The regulatory and AML systems in the Baltic region were actually weak at the time and unsurprisingly, they were exploited in no time. So, how was this done? The majority of these payments were processed through [offshore](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/offshore-1165) entities with minimal scrutiny which enabled illicit actors to funnel vast sums of money through Estonia, all under the guise of legitimacy. How Did the Scandal Come to Light? ---------------------------------- A former employee of Danske Bank’s Estonian branch, Howard Wilkinson acted as an in-formant and revealed systemic issues within the bank’s operations. The most striking insight about the issues was the flagging inadequacies in the handling of non-resident client accounts in 2017. The actual scope of the violations came to light after subsequent investigations by Danish and [Estonian](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-estonia-95) regulators. This was followed by the resignation of the bank’s CEO and involvement of multiple jurisdictions, including the [United States](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-united-states-of-america-80) and the United Kingdom, who proceeded to launch formal probes to determine the extent of the misconduct and who was accountable. The revelations unsurprisingly resulted in a sharp decline in Danske Bank. The bank was left with a sharp decline in the reputation, financial penalties and si-gnificant market value losses. [![Image 16: Know your customer is an important companent of anti-money laundering process](https://www.sanctionscanner.com//assets/images/Blog/what-are-the-kyc-and-aml-checks.png)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-aml-kyc-611) Timeline of Key Events ---------------------- Over a period spanning eight years between 2007 and 2015 where the transactions processed totaling $230 billion can be referred as the starting point of the incident. It is followed by the whistleblower report triggering investigations in 2017, the resignation of CEO and the investigations expanding to international scope in 2018 and finally Estonian branch inevitably shutting down operations in 2019. Today, legal proceedings and ensuing penalties still continue. Key Compliance Failures Behind the Scandal ------------------------------------------ So far, we have only briefly touched upon the compliance failures behind this scandal. Since, it is serves as a notable example of how multiple compliance failures may lead up to an International crisis, it would be wise to elaborate the failures behind this scandal. [**Know Your Customer (KYC)**](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/know-your-customer-kyc-46#:~:text=Sanction%20Scanner%20is%20an%20AML,can%20easily%20perform%20KYC%20checks.): First of all, poor Know Your Customer (KYC) certainly didn’t help the Estonian branch. A significant number of non-resident client accounts were accepted and the weak KYC processes, as well as risk assessment failures, created a gateway for illicit activities to occur unchecked. **[Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/what-is-sar-report-149))**: Just like the KYC procedures, ineffective Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) were inadequate as well, both in quantity and timeliness. **Transaction Monitoring Systems**: Another shortcoming was the weak transaction monitoring systems of the bank which resulted in the vast sums of money, which can always be potentially linked to money laundering or other criminal activities, to flow through the system undetected. In addition to these compliance faults, the disconnection between the Copenhagen head office and the Estonian branch certainly didn’t help avoiding a situation like this. The head office couldn’t provide sufficient oversight, auditing and accountability measure, which resulted in local compliance lapses and unaddressed potential misconduct for extended periods of time. ![Image 17](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/Key%20Compliance%20Failures%20Behind%20the%20Scandal.webp) Consequences for Danske Bank ---------------------------- Danske Bank went through several immediate and long-lasting repercussions. It goes without saying that the Estonian branch was forced to shut down operations, thus leaving a significant gap in the regional network. Unfortunately, the damage wasn’t only done to the Estonian branch. Danske Bank’s market value plummeted and key executives were compel-led to resign. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice, European authorities and various financial institutions led several investigations and the bank faced further regulatory fines and legal liabilities but on the bright side, the scandal served as a catalyst for broader AML reforms within the European Union. Why This Case Was a Turning Point for AML in Europe? ---------------------------------------------------- It’s because this scandal acted as a wake-up call for the European Commission and the commission subsequently proceeded to propose the creation of a centralized [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/top-11-aml-tools-for-2025-features-prices-use-cases-1020) regulatory body called AMLA. In addition to the AMLA, financial transaction monitoring systems have shifted to empha-size real-time oversight to enable authorities to quickly detect and mitigate risks associated with transnational money laundering by leveraging advanced technology, such as AI-driven analytics. Financial institutions are now mandated to adopt more detailed and stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols that must include additional verification steps for non-resident and high-risk clients, such as detailed background checks, ongoing monitoring of transac-tional behavior, and enhanced scrutiny for [politically exposed persons (PEPs)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/politically-exposed-person-pep-56). Another thing that set off the alarm bells was that it demonstrated how urgent it was for financial institutions to adopt a more proactive compliance culture. So, the banks and other entities implemented risk-based strategies tailored to their specific operational environments. Obviously, it depends on the needs of the business but primary examples would be regular staff training, the establishment of clear internal reporting channels, and the use of advanced tools to identify and mitigate risks related to illicit activities. [![Image 18](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/AML-Software-Sanction-Scanner.webp)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/request-demo) How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank? ------------------------------------------------ Preventing another scandal of this magnitude requires adopting cutting-edge technological solutions tailored for AML compliance. Luckily, there are tools like Sanction Scanner, which are fine examples of how technology can be used to empower financial institutions to detect and mitigate financial crime risks. Let’s come to the what these technologies can deliver. Real-Time Name Screening, Automated Transaction Monitoring and Comprehensive Risk Assessments serve as good examples that incorporate competent algorithms and AI models. FAQ's Blog Post --------------- What is the Danske Bank money laundering scandal? What is the Danske Bank money laundering scandal? How much money was laundered through Danske Bank? Investigations revealed that approximately €200 billion in potentially suspicious funds were moved through non-resident accounts in Danske Bank's Estonian branch over eight years. Who was involved in the Danske Bank scandal? The scandal involved Danske Bank employees, Estonian regulators, foreign shell companies, and clients from Russia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and other high-risk jurisdictions. Several top executives, including the former CEO Thomas Borgen, resigned or faced charges. What was the role of Estonia in the Danske Bank scandal? Danske Bank’s Estonian branch was the central point for processing suspicious cross-border transactions. Estonia's relatively lax AML enforcement at the time enabled these transactions to go undetected for years. What were the consequences for Danske Bank? Danske Bank faced multiple investigations by EU and US authorities. It was forced to shut down operations in Estonia, paid hundreds of millions in fines, and saw a massive reputational decline, including criminal charges filed in Denmark and other jurisdictions. Why is the Danske Bank case significant for AML compliance? The case exposed systemic failures in AML controls, due diligence, and cross-border supervision, prompting regulators worldwide to tighten oversight, especially regarding non-resident accounts and correspondent banking. Has Danske Bank been penalized by the U.S.? Yes. In December 2022, Danske Bank agreed to forfeit $2 billion as part of a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC for defrauding U.S. banks and violating AML laws.

В соответствии с заключённым с Минюстом США соглашением за содействие и существенный вклад Эстонии в проведение расследования в отношении Danske Bank Estonia американскими властями стране будет возвращена сумма в размере 50 млн долларов США (более 4,2 млрд рублей в эквиваленте) для целей совершенствования национальной системы противодействия финансовым преступлениям (особенно ОД/ФТ, мошенничеству и киберпреступности), развития программ обучения специалистов в противолегализационной сфере, а также криминалистической экспертизы цифровых данных и проведения кампаний по повышению осведомлённости населения о финансовых преступлениях.

О совместном докладе ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в Италии 7 января 2025 года опубликован доклад о результатах совместного исследования ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в стране4. В докладе отмечается, что задача по определению точного размера ОД в стране заведомо представляется труднодостижимой и крайне проблематичной в связи со скрытым характером незаконных финансовых потоков, а также наличием ряда ограничений, связанных с доступными данными и недостатками в применяемых до настоящего времени методологиях оценки. В рамках указанного исследования в целях получения наиболее точной оценки ОД в стране итальянским ПФР и Банком Италии использовалась усовершенствованная методология, предусматривающая процедуру тщательного отбора СПО для анализа содержащихся в них данных, применение специализированного алгоритма машинного обучения для выявления надёжной информации из массива доступных данных и использование метода статистической подборки для вычисления 3 В период 2008-2016 гг. Danske Bank в целях получения максимально возможной прибыли умышленно нарушал требования американского противолегализационного законодательства, содействовал ОД через американскую финансовую систему и в конечном итоге стал представлять собой существенную угрозу для её стабильности. Danske Bank признал ответственность за введение в заблуждение американских банков и проведение через американскую финансовую систему подозрительных операций для высокорисковых клиентов на суммы, исчисляемые в миллиардах долларов США. В 2022 г. по результатам проведённого американскими властями расследования Danske Bank был оштрафован на более чем 2 млрд долларов США (более 204,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). 4 The size of money laundering and other illicit financial conduct for Italy.

По результатам анализа объёмы ОД в период с 2018 по 2022 гг. в Италии варьировали от 25 до 35 млрд евро, что в среднем составило около 1,8 % от ВВП страны за указанный период.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже BitMEX 15 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о применении к международной криптовалютной бирже BitMEX5 штрафных санкций в связи с выявленными нарушениями требований Закона США о банковской тайне (BSA/AML)6. По результатам проверки Прокуратуры Южного округа штата Нью-Йорк установлено, что криптовалютной биржей умышленно нарушались требования BSA/AML при оказании услуг американским клиентам. В частности, биржей не была разработана, внедрена и не применялась эффективная программа по ПОД/ФТ. При этом в компании сознательно, c одобрения руководства компании, применялись минимальные требования по идентификации клиентов при принятии их на обслуживание (у клиентов запрашивалась только информация об адресе электронной почты). Топ-менеджмент компании был осведомлён о том, что проживающие на территории США клиенты как минимум с 2018 года пользовались для проведения операций торговой платформой BitMEX. При этом механизмы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ компании были абсолютно неэффективны и позволили BitMEX провести через американскую финансовую систему миллионы долларов США. За умышленное нарушений требований BSA/AML BitMEX выплатит штраф в размере 100 млн долларов США (около 8,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, для биржи установлен двухлетний срок, в течение которого ей предписано устранить выявленные недостатки в части выполнения требований BSA/AML.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже KuCoin 27 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз о применении Министерством юстиции США штрафных санкций к компании-оператору одной из крупнейших криптовалютных бирж KuCoin7 – Peken Global Limited (Peken) – за нарушение требований законодательства в сфере ПОД/ФТ. 5 Криптовалютная биржа BitMEX – одна из крупнейших в мире торговых платформ криптовалютных деривативов на базе биткоин; принадлежит компании HDR Global Trading Limited, зарегистрированной в Республике Сейшелы; в настоящее время является лидером по объёму торгов (свыше 300 тыс. биткоинов в сутки, что составляет более 2,5 млрд долларов в эквиваленте). 6 Закон США о банковской тайне (Bank Secrecy Act, BSA) известен также как Закон о предоставлении отчётности о валютных и трансграничных операциях (Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act) и Закон о противодействии отмыванию доходов, полученных преступным путём (Anti-Money Laundering Law). 7 KuCoin KuCoin зарегистрирована в Республике Сейшелы в 2017 г.; занимает 6-е место среди криптовалютных бирж по объёму торгов. По состоянию на 28.01.2025 суточный объём торгов на KuCoin составляет 1,9 млрд долларов США.

KuCoin осуществляла в США нелицензированную деятельность в качестве оператора по переводу денежных средств. Кроме того, в период с 2017 г. по март 2024 г. криптовалютной биржей не выполнялись требования противолегализационного законодательства, связанные с применением мер НПК, информированием ПФР о подозрительных операциях, в результате чего через биржу были проведены подозрительные операции (со средствами, полученными в результате незаконной торговли на площадках даркнет, использования вредоносного программного обеспечения, программ-вымогателей и мошеннических схем) на миллиарды долларов США. Даже после внедрения процедур НПК биржа не смогла обеспечить должным образом идентификацию уже существующих клиентов. Сумма штрафа для компании составила более 297,4 млн долларов США (более 25,1 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Источник информации: официальный сайт Министерства юстиции США в сети Интернет. Об отчёте Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 г. 28 января 2025 года опубликован отчёт Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin) о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 год. К основным рискам, угрожающим стабильности финансового сектора Германии (наряду с рисками, связанными с уязвимостями сектора недвижимости; рисками невозврата кредитов юридическими лицами; рисками кибербезопасности; рисками, связанными с изменениями на финансовом рынке; рисками рыночной концентрации в результате IT аутсорсинга), отнесены риски, связанные с ненадлежащим применением мер в сфере ПОД/ФТ. Приоритетность задач по снижению рисков ОД/ФТ в финансовом секторе Германии продолжает сохраняться на высоком уровне (с учётом того, что 96% всех СПО, поступивших в немецкое ПФР в 2023 г., были направлены представителями финансового сектора). Также BaFin зафиксирован рост рисков, связанных с использованием неофициальных систем по переводу/перемещению денежных средств и ценностей (например, хавала), новых технологий, виртуальных международных номеров банковского счёта (IBAN), криптоактивов.

Банком (i) не осуществлялся должным образом мониторинг подозрительных операций клиентов (в связи с неэффективностью системы мониторинга операций); (ii) не применялись меры по выявлению и снижению рисков совершения финансовых преступлений в установленные законодательством сроки; (iii) допускались существенные задержки при обработке оповещений системы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ о рисках ОД/ФТ и потенциально незаконной финансовой деятельности. Совокупная сумма штрафа для банка составила 20 млн евро (более 1,8 млрд рублей в эквиваленте), из них 5 млн евро – за нарушения противолегализационного законодательства.

О руководстве Европола по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями 30 января 2025 года Полицейской службой Европейского союза (Европола) опубликовано руководство по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями в целях противодействия ОД/ФТ и другим финансовым преступлениям10. В руководстве отмечается важная роль государственно-частных партнёрств и иных аналогичных механизмов в обеспечении эффективного взаимодействия между финансовыми организациями, ПФР и следственными органами при проведении расследований преступлений, в частности ОД, в части обмена персональными данными и/или конфиденциальной информацией, связанной с уголовными расследованиями. После вступления в силу нового европейского противолегализационного законодательства стала очевидна ценность такого взаимодействия, которое позволило обмениваться не только данными о типологиях преступлений, но и специфическими данными по конкретным уголовным делам, что способствует повышению эффективности расследований и возврата преступных активов. В настоящее время государственно-частные партнёрства, обеспечивающие обмен информацией по вопросам ПОД, в той или иной форме существуют во всех странах Европы. Однако, механизмы, которые позволяют обмениваться персональными данными, относящимися к конфиденциальным расследованиям правоохранительных органов, существуют11 только в Великобритании, Дании, Ирландии, Латвии, Нидерландах и Швеции. В состав таких механизмов взаимодействия обычно входят: ПФР, полицейские ведомства, прокуратура, налоговые и надзорные органы; значимые (на национальном уровне или с операционной точки зрения) финансовые организации, 9 Пруденциальный надзор за деятельностью De Volksbank (с учётом его значимости для финансового рынка) осуществляет непосредственно ЕЦБ. 10 EFIPPP Practical Guide for Operational Cooperation between Investigative Authorities and Financial Institutions. 11 На момент публикации руководства.

Сотрудничество между компетентными органами и финансовыми организациями может осуществляться в следующих целях: - разработки новых направлений расследования; - обеспечения сбора доказательной базы по текущим расследованиям; - пресечения угроз финансовых преступлений посредством применения превентивных мер; - расширения возможностей финансовых организаций по защите от финансовых преступлений. Отмечается, что следственные органы, как правило, недооценивают тот факт, что финансовые организации играют ключевую роль в качестве «гейткиперов»12 в системе ПОД/ФТ при выявлении незаконных финансовых потоков и обладают всесторонними компетенциями и эффективными цифровыми решениями, обеспечивающими выявление преступной деятельности. Вместе с тем для того, чтобы наиболее эффективно использовать потенциал частного сектора в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями, представляется возможным изменить характер взаимодействия между компетентными ведомствами и частным сектором, которое в настоящее время в большей степени основано на исполнении частным сектором указаний со стороны государственных органов, и переориентировать его на коллективное системное реагирование на угрозы финансовых преступлений. Это в конечном итоге будет способствовать повышению эффективности уголовных расследований и укреплению потенциала частного сектора в части выявления и предотвращения финансовых преступлений.

Предлагаемый законопроектом механизм изъятия денежных средств во внесудебном порядке «не соответствует Конституции РФ и гражданскому законодательству», говорится в отзыве Счетной палаты. «Согласно статье 35 Конституции РФ никто не может быть лишен своего имущества иначе как по решению суда», - напоминает СП. При этом проект допускает возможность судебного обжалования решение об отнесении клиента к «красной зоне» только после обращения в межведомственную комиссию. Счетная палата предлагает рассмотреть возможность решения таких споров как в административном, так и в судебном порядке, что «в большей степени соответствует конституционным принципам права на защиту», говорится в отзыве.

Кроме того, Центробанк теперь не считает сомнительной операцию, когда клиент осуществляет транзакцию через представителя, не вступающего с банком в личный контакт. ### 2020 #### Сокращение объема незаконного обналичивания на 32 млрд рублей Объем незаконного обналичивания средств в российских [банках](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8,_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82 \"Финансовые услуги, инвестиции и аудит\") по итогам 2020 года сократился на 32 млрд [рублей](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8C \"Российский рубль\") — до 78 млрд рублей с 110 млрд рублей в 2019-м. Об этом сообщил заместитель председателя правления [ЦБ РФ](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%91_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ЦБ РФ\") [Дмитрий Скобелкин](/index.php/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0:%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 \"Скобелкин Дмитрий Германович\"). Он назвал этот спад «неплохим показателем», учитывая, что в условиях пандемии коронавируса [[COVID-19] вопрос незаконного обналичивания средств «стоял и стоит достаточно остро». Замглавы Банка [России](/index.php/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Россия\") обратил внимание, что в 2020 году россияне активно снимали наличные деньги, чем пользовались и обнальщики. Однако, как подчеркнул Скобелкин, [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") в целом справились с ситуацией. Объем незаконного обналичивания в 2020 году сократился на 32 млрд рублей По словам Скобелкина, объем сомнительных транзитных операций в банках в 2020 году снизился до 600 млрд рублей со 720 млрд рублей годом ранее. Незаконный вывод денег за рубеж через российские кредитные организации уменьшился на 21,2% — до 52 млрд рублей с 66 млрд рублей. Согласно статистике, которую привел зампред Центробанка, правоохранительные органы возбудили более 20 крупных уголовных дел на основании сообщений, которые банки отправляли в финансовую разведку. Как сообщили в ЦБ РФ, в 2020 году в России зарегистрировано несколько новых схем обналичивания средств. Так, мошенники стали активно использовать схемы с исполнительными листами и с депозитными счетами нотариусов. По данным регулятора, на них пришлось более 40% операций по обналичиванию через счета физлиц. В случае со схемой с исполнительными документами иностранная компания-пустышка взыскивает через суд фиктивный долг с российской фирмы (иногда с заблокированным за сомнительные операции счетом) и тем самым добивается «чистоты» происхождения средств - деньги переводятся не напрямую из компании в компанию, а через службу судебных приставов. В модификации этой схемы, которую стали использовать обнальщики, одной из сторон выступает физлицо. Банки при этом не имеют права препятствовать исполнению решений суда.[[5]](#cite_note-4) #### Принят закон, уточняющий схему работы банков с клиентами в рамках \"антиотмывочных\" норм [Госдума РФ](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"Госдума РФ\") в декабре 2020 года приняла закон, который уточняет схему работы банков с клиентами при наличии подозрений, связанных с действием \"антиотмывочного\" законодательства (ФЗ-115). Документ (N948530-7) был внесен в парламент правительством в конце апреля. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | | Как пояснял ранее замминистра финансов Алексей Моисеев, поправки исключают возможность злоупотребления со стороны банков при использовании и отказе в открытии счетов со ссылкой на 115 федеральный закон. \"В частности, предусматривается, что непредставление в кредитную организацию документа, который предназначен для фиксации информации в соответствии с положениями данного закона, не будет являться основанием для принятия решения об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, либо отказе в выполнении распоряжении клиента о совершении операции с денежными средствами или имуществом\", — сказал замминистра. | | Предусматривается информирование клиента об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, предоставление причины такого отказа, также устанавливается срок для информирования о принятии данного решения: 5 дней. Решение об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета или о его расторжении принимается руководителем кредитной организации или специально уполномоченными им лицами. Сокращается с 10 до 7 дней срок, в течение которого организация обязана сообщить клиенту об устранении оснований, в соответствии с которыми ранее было принято решение об отказе от проведения операции или об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета. #### Власти Чехии арестовали $13 млн, поступившие от российского ИТ-дистрибутора Как стало известно TAdviser, власти [Чехии](/index.php/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Чехия\") по подозрению в отмывании арестовали $13,3 млн, поступившие местной компании Bardet от российского импортера ИТ-оборудования «Техтраст».

О новом проекте «[Известиям](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F%D0%BC \"Известиям\")» рассказали в [БКС Банке](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F:%D0%91%D0%9A%D0%A1_-_%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA \"БКС - Инвестиционный Банк\"). Предполагается, что в сервисе будет предусмотрен личный кабинет: после прохождения авторизации клиент сможет увидеть, есть ли в его адрес официально зафиксированные сведения по «антиотмывочному» закону со стороны кредитных организаций и какой именно банк выступает их источником. В России создают разрабатывают платформу для проверки «антиотмывочной» истории банковских клиентов В БКС Банке отметили, что кредитные организации заинтересованы в сокращении пути реабилитации и упрощении коммуникации с кредитными организациями и регулятором для добросовестных клиентов.

Это на 6% больше по сравнению с 2022-м, когда затраты оценивались в $13,52 млрд. Обзор отрасли приводится в материалах Market Research Future, обнародованных в начале сентября 2024 года. Авторы исследования выделяют несколько ключевых факторов, способствующих росту спроса на цифровые решения для борьбы с отмыванием денег.

[ИИ](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\")-алгоритмы способны анализировать огромные массивы данных, выявлять подозрительные закономерности и автоматизировать рутинные процессы. Развитие отрасли также стимулируется благодаря развертыванию облачных решений, обеспечивающих многочисленные преимущества, такие как масштабируемость, более низкая стоимость, гибкое управление рисками, уменьшенное время развертывания и оперативное обновление.

Об этом сообщается в отчете финансовой организации [SWIFT](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:SWIFT \"SWIFT\"), опубликованном в начале сентября 2020 года[[10]](#cite_note-9)[[11]](#cite_note-10). Согласно отчету, случаи отмывания [хакерами](/index.php/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8 \"Хакерами\") похищенных денег через [криптовалюту](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") встречаются очень редко. Количество выявленных случаев отмывания средств через криптовалюту остается сравнительно небольшим по сравнению с суммами, отмываемыми традиционными способами – с помощью «денежных мулов», подставных компаний и инвестиций в другие виды преступной деятельности (наркоторговлю, торговлю людьми и пр.). В качестве примера использования [криптовалюты](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") для отмывания денег в отчете SWIFT приведено дело об одной из киберпреступных группировок, занимающихся атаками на банкоматы. Хотя популярным способом отмывания похищенных средств у таких группировок является покупка и перепродажа дорогостоящих товаров, киберпреступники конвертировали похищенную из банкоматов «наличку» в криптовалюту. Еще одним примером является восточноевропейская группировка, запустившая собственную криптоферму в Восточной [Азии](/index.php/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Азия\"). Киберпреступники использовали похищенные у банков средства для финансирования работы криптофермы и генерирования [биткойнов](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Биткойнов\"), которые затем тратились в странах Восточной [Европы](/index.php/%D0%95%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0 \"Европа\"). После ареста участников группировки сотрудники правоохранительных органов обнаружили в доме у их лидера 15 тыс. биткойнов стоимостью $109 млн и ювелирные украшения на общую сумму в $557 тыс., а также два спортивных автомобиля. Криптовалютой для отмывания похищенных средств также пользуется киберпреступная группировка Lazarus, предположительно работающая на северокорейское правительство. Согласно отчету SWIFT, киберпреступники похищают деньги у банков, конвертируют в криптовалюту через множество бирж с целью скрыть их происхождение, а затем снова переводят в реальные деньги и отправляют на счета в [КНДР](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%9D%D0%94%D0%A0 \"КНДР\"). В редких случаях злоумышленники покупают на похищенные у банков средства предоплаченные криптовалютные карты – физические дебетовые карты, на которых вместо реальных денег можно держать криптовалюту. Снимать средства с таких карт можно через специальные банкоматы, кроме того, их можно использовать для оплаты товаров и услуг. Однако, как подчеркивают эксперты, представленные выше примеры – это, скорее, исключение, чем правило. Такие случаи встречаются очень редко по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денег. Тем не менее, по мнению специалистов, в будущем число подобных случаев будет расти. #### Американские адвокаты будут расследовать масштабные случаи отмывания денег в Эстонии [Эстония](/index.php/%D0%AD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Эстония\") заключила договор с действующим в США адвокатским бюро Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP об оказании правовых услуг эстонскому государству по вопросам, связанным с фактами международного отмывания денег[[12]](#cite_note-11).

Sa succursale estonienne disposait d’un portefeuille de clients internationaux qui recouraient fréquemment à des sociétés écrans, leur permettant de contourner la réglementation fiscale. La banque danoise a fait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment en lien avec une société française dont la gérante a été condamnée en procédure de comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité en janvier 2024. Le 18 septembre 2024, la convention judiciaire d’intérêt publique (“CJIP”) conclue entre le procureur de la République financier et la société Danske Bank A/S a été validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris[1]. Cette dernière faisait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment de fraude fiscale commis en bande organisée, affaire dans laquelle la gérante personne physique d’une société d’import-export, a été condamnée pour blanchiment de [fraude fiscale](https://navacelle.law/fr/expertise/droit-penal-fiscal/) par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris, le 9 janvier 2024[2]. ##### En février 2014, le parquet de Paris a été destinataire d’une plainte pour recel d’escroquerie et blanchiment, du fonds d’investissement Hermitage Capital[3]. En juin 2014, TRACFIN a transféré[4] une note au parquet de Paris, faisant état d’une activité suspecte sur les comptes bancaires de la société française d’import-export Decobat. En effet, au titre de sa mission de service de renseignement, TRACFIN dispose de moyens d’investigation divers lui permettant de recueillir des éléments susceptibles de caractériser une infraction de blanchiment du produit d’une infraction punie d’une peine privative de liberté supérieure à un an ou du financement du terrorisme au sens de l’article L.561-30-1 du Code monétaire et financier[5]. ##### Le 8 juillet 2014, une enquête préliminaire portant notamment sur les activités d’importation en Russie de cette société a été ouverte[6]. Une information judiciaire a par la suite été ouverte le 9 avril 2015 des chefs de fraude fiscale en bande organisée, blanchiment et recel d’escroquerie en bande organisée pour des faits commis en France et de manière indivisible à l’étranger depuis 2008[7]. L’instruction a révélé que la succursale estonienne de la banque danoise, la Sampo Bank, détenait un portefeuille de milliers de clients résidant en dehors de l’Estonie (le “PNR”)[8], qu’elle savait à haut risque en raison des pays de résidence des clients, leur recours fréquent à des sociétés écrans susceptibles de masquer l’identité de leurs bénéficiaires effectifs, de l’expéditeur ou du destinataire des transactions et effectuaient des transactions suspectes[9]. Il apparaissait ainsi que la succursale était dotée d’un dispositif de conformité insuffisant concernant le PNR[10], étant donné qu’il permettait aux clients d’ouvrir des comptes et d’enregistrer des transactions sans contrôle ou diligence raisonnable[11]. L’enquête a ainsi révélé que la gérante de Decobat avait pu ouvrir deux comptes auprès de la Sampo Bank, au nom de deux sociétés écrans, utilisés comme comptes de transit pour contourner les règles fiscales et douanières[12]. En effet, la société Decobat exportait ses marchandises vers la Russie en les vendant à une société de droit russe mais en réalisant via des _brokers_ des déclarations douanières à l’import dans les pays baltes _,_ qui étaient minorées revoyant à la baisse l’évaluation des droits de douanes et de la TVA. La société russe transférait ensuite ses bénéfices au Luxembourg vers des comptes ouverts dans les Îles Vierges britanniques et au Luxembourg par le biais de ses comptes ouverts à la Sampo Bank[13]. Les audits de Danske Bank effectués jusqu’en 2014, ainsi que d’autres procédures de contrôle interne, ont systématiquement conclu à un contrôle des clients jugé satisfaisant, révélant une attitude passive et complaisante de l’entreprise, malgré les alertes de la Financial Supervisory Authority (“FSA”) danoise[14]. L’inefficacité de ces mécanismes a permis à la dirigeante de Decobat, résidente fiscale française, de transférer plus de 3 millions d’euros depuis ses deux autres sociétés vers des comptes au Luxembourg, au nom de sociétés offshore dont elle était la bénéficiaire effective[15]. ##### La Danske Bank A/S était alors été mise en examen pour des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, commis entre 2007 et 2014, aggravés par la circonstance qu’ils étaient perpétrés en bande organisée, utilisant plusieurs intermédiaires dont les opérations visaient uniquement à dissimuler la destination des fonds détournés et à en faire profiter des bénéficiaires à l’étranger[16]. Ces pratiques ont notamment conduit à la condamnation de la banque danoise en 2022, d’abord par les autorités danoises pour manquement aux obligations de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement des activités terroristes, puis par les autorités américaines pour conspiration en vue de commettre une fraude bancaire[17]. En France, la banque danoise a reconnu les faits reprochés, incriminés aux articles 324-1, 324-2, 324-3, 324-4, 324-7, 324-8 et 324-9 du Code pénal[18], lui permettant de bénéficier de la CJIP, alternative aux poursuites dont l’avantage est notamment de limiter l’amende d’intérêt public[19]. Aux termes de la [CJIP négociée](https://www.justice.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2024-09/CJIP_DANSKE_BANK_AS_20240827.pdf) avec le parquet national financier (“PNF”), elle a accepté de payer de la somme de 6 028 799€ au titre de l’amende d’intérêt public[20], après analyse des facteurs majorants, tel que le caractère répété des faits ou l’insuffisance du programme de conformité[21] et minorants, à l’instar des mesures correctives mises en place au sein de la Danske Bank ou encore de sa coopération dans l’enquête[22]. Elle a également consenti à verser 300 000 euros pour indemniser l’État français, dont 10 000 euros pour le préjudice matériel et 290 000 euros pour le préjudice moral[23]. Cette approche se distingue de celle de la Cour de cassation qui a retenu à plusieurs reprises que le délit de blanchiment de fraude fiscale ne cause à l’État aucun préjudice moral susceptible d’être réparé dès lors que le préjudice “_découlant des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, caractérisé par le discrédit jeté sur les politiques de lutte contre le blanchiment_” n’est pas distinct du préjudice causé à l’intérêt général réparé par l’action du ministère public[24]. Sauf à démontrer l’existence d’un préjudice moral autre que celui lié au discrédit, cette CJIP a permis à l’État de bénéficier de la réparation d’un préjudice dont l’existence n’aurait potentiellement pas été reconnue dans le cadre d’un procès devant un Tribunal correctionnel.

The case involved Danske Bank's Estonian branch, which maintained a portfolio of high-risk international clients who frequently used shell companies to evade tax regulations. The bank was investigated for facilitating money laundering activities linked to a French import-export company, whose manager was convicted in January 2024. The investigation revealed that Danske Bank's compliance controls were inadequate, allowing clients to open accounts and conduct transactions without proper due diligence. The CJIP, validated by the Paris Judicial Court on September 18, 2024, required Danske Bank to pay a public interest fine of €6,028,799 and an additional €300,000 in compensation to the French state. The settlement took into account aggravating factors such as repeated offenses and compliance program deficiencies, as well as mitigating factors like corrective measures and cooperation with authorities. Danske Bank also faced previous penalties in Denmark and the US for related AML failures and fraud.

Судя по внутренней переписке, в компании это было поводом для шуток. #### Автор: 12 ноября 2024 г. Март 2013 года. Алексей Аверсон, клиент-менеджер в эстонском Swedbank, только что завершил встречу с потенциальными корпоративными клиентами и получил шутливое сообщение от коллеги: «Как дела на отмывочном рынке?» «Ко мне вчера приходили товарищи отмыватели с золотыми часами. Предлагали сотрудничать», — ответил Аверсон. Он добавил, что Роберт Китт, тогдашний глава отдела по работе с корпоративными клиентами и будущий гендиректор компании, в курсе событий: «Китт почти согласился, а я нет». «Китт согласился? — удивился коллега. Серьезно? Он не осознает риски?» «Его не интересует борьба с отмыванием денег, его интересует бизнес. Он один из нас, пусть будет председателем комитета :)», — отшутился Аверсон. Судя по всему, он говорил о группе банковских менеджеров и руководителей, ответственных за общение с ценными корпоративными клиентами (Китт не ответил на обвинения в сокрытии отмывания денег в банке, Аверсон отказался от подробных комментариев). Это так называемые HRNR-клиенты: высокорисковые компании-нерезиденты, многие из которых ([как позже выявило расследование](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/swedbanks-high-risk-secrets)) контролировали российские олигархи. Они обращались в эстонский Swedbank за помощью с регистрацией и управлением счетами для сложных офшорных сетей, через которые выводили миллионы долларов из России. HRNR-клиенты посодействовали успеху банка: как [сообщали СМИ](https://www.svt.se/special/swedbank/rapporten/) со ссылкой на внутренние документы Swedbank, с 2008 по 2018 год на их долю пришлось более 100 миллиардов евро от общего оборота. Благодаря этому Swedbank стал вторым по величине банком в Эстонии. Все поменялось в 2019 году, когда журналисты шведского телеканала SVT раскрыли, что Swedbank и [Danske Bank](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat/the-contract-factory-inside-danske-bank-estonias-money-laundering-machine) использовали для перемещения средств (суммарно почти шесть миллиардов долларов) через подозрительные счета в странах Балтии. Расследование OCCRP и «Важных историй» показало, что Swedbank помог одному из самых прибыльных клиентов, российскому олигарху и экс-министру Михаилу Абызову, вывести сотни миллионов долларов на офшорные счета на Кипре, Британских Виргинских Островах, в Сингапуре и Белизе. Из них 53 миллиона долларов, как позже установил российский суд, Абызов похитил из двух сибирских энергетических компаний. (С Абызовым не удалось связаться для получения комментариев, поскольку он находится в тюрьме. Когда OCCRP впервые сообщил о его счетах в Swedbank, его адвокат отказался комментировать результаты расследования.) Новости о том, что Swedbank организовал масштабную отмывочную схему для крупных корпоративных клиентов, стали основанием для международного расследования. Шведское разбирательство завершилось лишь в этом году: в сентябре бывшую руководительницу Swedbank Биргитте Боннесен [приговорили](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/swedish-court-sends-ex-ceo-of-swedbank-to-prison) к 15 месяцам тюрьмы. Суд постановил, что Боннесен, которая с 2016 по 2019 год занимала в банке должность гендиректора, а перед этим три года возглавляла отдел по работе с клиентами из стран Балтии, обманывала общественность и акционеров насчет рисков отмывания денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Власти Эстонии надеялись на аналогичный исход, открыв дело в отношении ряда топ-менеджеров, руководителей и сотрудников банка. Однако процесс застопорился, когда выяснилось, что необходимо сотрудничество России. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли, поставив под сомнение способность мировых судов преследовать коррупционеров в случаях, когда требуется содействие России или других авторитарных режимов. Журналисты не могли получить судебные документы, пока дело было открыто. Теперь же в распоряжении Delfi Estonia, партнера OCCRP, оказались следственные документы, согласно которым сотрудники банка систематически нарушали протоколы в сфере обеспечения прозрачности, чтобы помочь российским олигархам, входившим в число главных клиентов, сохранить анонимность. 300 файлов, которые эстонская прокуратура предоставила после запроса на основании Закона о свободе информации, включают отредактированные полицейские записи и внутренние документы из эстонского отделения Swedbank, в том числе письма, переписку и служебные записки. Судя по сообщениям, менеджеры по работе с клиентами вроде Аверсона (зачастую они первыми встречали новых клиентов, и их карьера зависела от удовлетворения клиентских потребностей) открыто обсуждали отмывание денег и даже шутили об этом. «Я бы не открыл ему счет, но чувак принес бутылку Hennessy X.O., — написал Аверсон коллеге в августе 2014 года. — Тогда я решил: “фиг с ним, хоть есть за что”». «Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио, — похвастался другой менеджер о клиенте. — Много отмывают, ничего не боятся». Еще один сотрудник банка написал, что его бывший коллега «по уши погряз в отмывании». Что ж, [наш коллега] В хорошо поработал [с клиентом]. Теперь отправим туда независимую делегацию. В идеале хотелось бы посмотреть без его комментариев, насколько там все прозрачно. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Не пугай там [у клиента] слишком сильно [менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. А то В заверяет, что все прекрасно, а потом появляетесь вы и наводите шухер.)) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ты же там с ним уже был, да? Все же выглядело чисто и прозрачно? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Мне нравится, как звучит «чистое и прозрачное отмывание денег».))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ну на месте разберемся — ни у меня, ни у M\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* нет достойных часов… К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Хехехехе :9))))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Тормози, не так прямо. Все равно все тщательно проверим с Алексеем [Аверсоном]. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Понял. И вам часы нужны. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Я не привередливый) Деньги тоже норм. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Окей. Деньги ликвиднее часов. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. А [клиент] вообще еще активен? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио. Много отмывают, ничего не боятся. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Главное, что ничего не скрывают.)))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Точно, скоро будут платежи подписывать: «отмытые деньги, взятка, грязные деньги». К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. В эстонских следственных документах есть транскрипты коммуникаций между сотрудниками Swedbank. Тут менеджеры по работе с клиентами обсуждают планы банка отправить делегацию к HRNR-клиенту, чтобы проверить его деятельность на «чистоту». Их смешит концепция «прозрачного отмывания денег». Чат переведен (оригинал на смеси русского, эстонского и английского языков), некоторые части сокращены для ясности. Имена клиентов и менеджеров, которые не были подозреваемыми в ходе расследования, скрыты. В эстонском филиале Swedbank отказались комментировать письма и другие материалы, которые получили журналисты, но сказали, что расследование закрыли «за неимением преступления». Они отметили, что на сайте юридической фирмы Clifford Chance, которую в 2019 году банк нанял для расследования возможного отмывания денег, опубликован отчет. Представители Аверсона сообщили, что он сотрудничал со следствием, а теперь хочет оставить события десятилетней давности в прошлом. ## Попав в страны Балтии, Swedbank начал активно набирать клиентов-нерезидентов Swedbank вышел в страны Балтии в 1998 году, купив контрольный пакет банковской группы Hansabank. Десятилетие спустя Swedbank полностью поглотил Hansabank и жаждал развития бизнеса: менеджеры, в особенности русскоговорящие, как Аверсон, активно собирали клиентов. «Swedbank искал нерезидентов, — рассказал Аверсон следователям в сентябре 2020 года. — Нам сказали, что нужно привести сотни или даже тысячи клиентов». Аверсону достался бывший клиент Hansabank — российская компания «Кузбассразрезуголь» (КРУ). КРУ была одним из крупнейших клиентов эстонского Swedbank: капитал предприятия оценивался в сотни миллионов долларов, а его корпоративную сеть составляли почти 200 фирм. Контролировали компанию российские олигархи Андрей Бокарев и Искандер Махмудов. Однако согласно служебной записке, которой Аверсон в 2011 году сопроводил «экстренный» запрос на открытие счетов для развивающейся офшорной сети КРУ, не все фирмы были зарегистрированы на них. Банковский сотрудник объяснил, что КРУ — важный клиент, которому требовались дополнительные офшорные компании, не связанные напрямую с Бокаревым и Махмудовым, для минимизации налогов в России. В 2011 году портфолио Аверсона расширилось: КРУ продала одну из компаний Абызову — мультимиллионеру и близкому соратнику тогдашнего российского президента Дмитрия Медведева. Бизнес-группа Ru-Com Абызова участвовала во многих энергетических, строительных и сельскохозяйственных проектах. Аверсон ездил в Москву, чтобы лично подготовить бумаги для сделки. Через несколько месяцев ему сообщили, что Абызов хочет открыть множество офшорных счетов для Ru-Com. «Клиент обещает внести приличные депозиты в Swedbank», — написал Аверсон коллегам. Близость Абызова к тогдашнему президенту Медведеву делала его «политически значимым лицом» с повышенными коррупционными рисками, а значит, к нему должны были применить усиленный контроль. Однако согласно служебной записке, банковский комитет по работе с HRNR-клиентами без лишних вопросов согласился принять Ru-Com и Абызова — «главного бенефициара компаний-нерезидентов». Как сообщил Аверсон следователям, позже в Swedbank ввели некоторые ограничения касательно подбора клиентов. «Банк не работал с игорными и алкогольными бизнесами, у остальных компаний даже не спрашивали о происхождении активов», — поделился он. Вчера тоже — «Увеличьте мой лимит на 1 млн евро, нужно дать в долг «партнерам». Полный бардак. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Мои или чьи-то еще? А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Нет, нет, это клиенты [клиент-менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Хехе, это фигня. Теперь [клиент по прозвищу] Крокодил перевел 8 миллионов в Россию. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Вот это кредит. Но миллион — это мелочь. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. В разговоре между клиент-менеджером Swedbank Алексеем Аверсоном и коллегой основное внимание уделяется запросу неназванного клиента HRNR на перевод крупной суммы денег. IВ мае 2012 года Медведев, тогда премьер-министр, назначил Абызова министром по делам открытого правительства. Судя по всему, работа в правительстве не помешала бизнесу россиянина. Империя Ru-Com продолжила процветать. Согласно внутреннему документу за январь 2014 года, Swedbank открыл для Ru-Com 53 банковских счета. Хорошие новости вскоре попали в головной офис в Швеции: Китт переслал Боннесен сообщение, в котором Аверсон называет Абызова «одним из самых инновационных бизнесменов в России» и отмечает, что объем депозитов на счетах Ru-Com достиг 30 миллионов евро. ## Схемы с участием КРУ и Ru-Com привлекли внимание банковских контролеров Какое-то время КРУ и Ru-Com были крупнейшими клиентами-нерезидентами эстонского филиала Swedbank, однако к 2016 году в банке засомневались в правильности такого положения дел. Андреас Хоббелин, контролер Swedbank Group из Норвегии, начал задавать вопросы насчет КРУ и того, в какой степени аффилированные предприятия вроде Carbo One (компания по торговле углем, которой официально владели два других бизнесмена) на самом деле контролируют Махмудов и Бокарев. Махмудов тогда засветился в международных медиа в связи со схемой отмывания денег, выявленной в рамках испанской операции против российских преступников, известной как «Тройка». (Махмудов и Бокарев позже попали под санкции Минфина США [за связи с организованной преступностью](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1731).) [Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов](/processed/containers/assets/features/iskander-makhmudov.jpg/ef38d5c485ca2a8a058bda1a06fdd9fd/iskander-makhmudov.jpg) Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов К лету вопросы Хоббелина дошли до Аверсона, которого отправили на Кипр для личной встречи с одним из официальных собственников компании, гражданином Узбекистана. Аверсон позже сообщил, что его собеседник «произвел впечатление адекватного человека, очень спокойного и уверенного». Один из руководителей Swedbank, Хейки Раадик, надеялся, что благодаря неприметным владельцам Carbo One может остаться клиентом компании. При подготовке материалов о Carbo One для контролеров он пытался минимизировать связи компании с российскими олигархами. «Я бы удалил это сообщение: \"Махмудов и Бокарев имеют влияние на компанию, однако нет документальных подтверждений того, что [официальные собственники] — подставные лица\". Постарайтесь о них как можно меньше/короче упоминать», — написал он. Банкир выразил надежду на то, что этот вопрос не дойдет до банковского комитета по этике. Тем не менее в 2017 году Carbo One, Махмудов и Бокарев привлекли внимание Мари-Лийс Кург, начальницы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Кург ранее возглавляла аналогичный отдел в другом крупном эстонском банке, SEB. Swedbank нанял ее для совершенствования работы в сфере прозрачности. Однако все ее требования по соблюдению правил встречали жесткое сопротивление. «Разница в культуре комплаенс-контроля в двух банках меня поразила», — сказала она OCCRP. Обеспокоенная происходящим, Кург направила отчет о подозрительной активности в эстонское подразделение финансовой разведки (FIU) — правительственное агентство, ответственное за расследование случаев отмывания денег и других финансовых преступлений. Она указала, что Махмудов и Бокарев — «истинные бенефициары более 200 клиентов (компаний) в юрисдикциях с низким налогообложением», которых обслуживает Swedbank. «По данным неофициальных источников, клиенты замешаны в коррупционной деятельности и, вероятно, отмывании денег», — написала Кург в сопроводительном письме. В переписке с супервайзерами в Swedbank она предупредила, что дальнейшее сотрудничество с высокорисковыми клиентами вроде Carbo One поставит банк в трудное положение. Ранее в Deutsche Bank, обрабатывавшем некоторые транзакции Swedbank, сказали, что больше не будут принимать платежи «политически значимых лиц». Кург спросила, проходили ли средства Carbo One через Deutsche Bank за последние 18 месяцев. «Если да, вероятно, мы имеем дело с нарушением условий договора», — пояснила она. «Я все выходные переживала», — написала Кург. Получив отчет о подозрительной активности, FIU вызвало на допрос Кург и Свена Киввистика, тогдашнего главу отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в странах Балтии. Судя по внутренней переписке, руководители Swedbank забеспокоились. Китт назвал ситуацию «болезненной. Очень болезненной». «Мы имеем дело не с копами-новичками, — написал Киввистик, отметив, что один из следователей имел за плечами опыт более двадцати лет работы в полиции. — Его точно нельзя недооценивать». Менеджеры банка просчитывали, как Киввистику лучше общаться с FIU, чтобы минимизировать последствия показаний Кург. «Вопрос в том, как нейтрализовать активного и глупого человека, перед которым сидят опытные следователи, — написал Китт Киввистику о Кург. — Они сразу поймут по языку тела, если ты попытаешься ее оговорить». Кург говорит, что вскоре после допроса в FIU ее уволили. «Это был очень сложный период в моей карьере, — поделилась она. — Я не могла объяснить внезапное увольнение». Киввистик отказался от комментариев. ## Российский приговор Абызова помог Swedbank избежать наказания в Эстонии Судя по всему, в эстонском Swedbank поняли, что продолжать отношения с крупнейшим HRNR-клиентом — плохая идея, и в конце 2016 года прекратили сотрудничать с компаниями Ru-Com. К моменту, когда Кург направила отчет властям, та же участь постигла КРУ. Когда Swedbank дистанцировался от КРУ и Ru-Com, Аверсон — клиент-менеджер, который был ключевым звеном в работе с ними, — покинул банк и нашел нового работодателя — Абызова. Будучи директором одной из кипрских компаний россиянина, Аверсон отвечал за руководство [элитными активами](https://youtu.be/y35SmhHa4jA) Il Tesoro в Тоскане, включающими несколько вилл, теннисный корт, виноградники, оливковые рощи и вертолетную площадку. Сам Абызов в 2018 году покинул Россию, не получив второй срок в должности министра. В следующем году в ходе короткой поездки домой его арестовали и обвинили в хищении более 53 миллионов долларов из сибирских энергетических холдингов и выводе средств за границу. В декабре 2023 года его приговорили к 12 годам тюрьмы. Официальное расследование в отношении банка в Эстонии открыли в июле 2019 года. В центре внимания оказался тот факт, что Swedbank обманывал банки-корреспонденты и следователей, скрывая, что Абызов был главным бенефициаром структур Ru-Com. В 2015 году, когда в FIU запросили данные о владельцах нескольких фирм Ru-Com, эстонский филиал предоставил имена номинальных владельцев — хотя, как подтверждает переписка Аверсона, в банке знали, что за компаниями стоял Абызов. Два года спустя правоохранители отправили еще один запрос. Судя по утечке, банковский сотрудник обратился к коллеге за советом: «Знаю, что у тебя какие-то договоренности с Туулингом (Тоомас Туулинг — предшественник Кург на должности главы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег) касательно того, что некоторых нельзя называть, чтобы они сохранили анонимность». (Туулинг сообщил OCCRP, что это неправда, и у него «не было договоренностей с целью скрыть личность клиента или утаить информацию от властей». Он сказал, что банк не предоставил FIU информацию об Абызове, поскольку данные о бенефициарах держали отдельно от общей клиентской базы, доступной сотням сотрудников, чтобы защитить важных клиентов от возможных утечек. «Вне зависимости от того, где хранили информацию, менеджеры обязаны были передавать точные данные Комитету по работе с высокорисковыми клиентами», — добавил он.) Арест Абызова был важен для эстонского следствия, ведь требовалось доказать, что деньги, которые, предположительно, отмывали в Swedbank, — это доходы от преступной деятельности (в Эстонии, как и во многих других странах, даже при веских доказательствах отмывание денег не считается правонарушением без наличия предикатного преступления). Юридическая фирма Clifford Chance, которую Swedbank нанял после скандала 2019 года, установила, что с 2014 по 2019 год через эстонский филиал прошло более 21 миллиарда евро подозрительных транзакций. Однако в центре эстонского расследования оказалась лишь малая часть этой суммы — 53 миллиона долларов, которые, как установили правоохранители, провели через счета Абызова, прежде чем вывести на Кипр или обратно в Россию. Однако российский приговор олигарха предоставил адвокатам Swedbank уникальную возможность: они заявили, что Абызов — жертва политически мотивированного разбирательства, поскольку судья, который вел его дело, также вынес решения в пользу правительства в двух громких разбирательствах в отношении борцов с коррупцией. Защита настаивала на том, что Абызов может быть очередной жертвой кремлевского преследования. Доводы защиты о предвзятости приговора поставили правоохранителей в уязвимое положение: им требовались судебные документы из России. Из-за санкций и войны в Украине двустороннее сотрудничество между странами остановлено, и подать соответствующий запрос невозможно. Несмотря на наличие существенных доказательств обработки подозрительных транзакций, слабого документирования и контроля в Swedbank, а также компрометирующих внутренних коммуникаций, власти не смогли довести до конца один из самых громких скандалов вокруг отмывания денег в Эстонии. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли. ### Что делать, если отмывают деньги из «захваченного государства»? Эксперты по борьбе с коррупцией говорят, что произошедшее в эстонском филиале Swedbank вызывает опасения касательно возможности расследовать случаи отмывания денег c участием изолированных стран или государств под санкциями вроде России. «Это обычная ситуация, — говорит юрист Transparency International Куш Амин. — Правоохранители, которые просят правовой помощи у захваченного государства, понимают, что, скорее всего, не добьются уровня сотрудничества, необходимого для доказательства предикатного преступления к отмыванию средств. Особенно если в деле замешаны высокопоставленные чиновники или физические и юридические лица со связями в политике». Амин рассказал, что во Франции придумали возможное решение этой проблемы. Там доказательства требуют не от обвинения, а от защиты: необходимо обосновать легальность подозрительных транзакций. «Эта тактика, так называемая опровержимая презумпция, предоставляет правоохранителям лазейку в случае, если предикатное преступление совершено в стране, которая не готова сотрудничать, — говорит Амин. — Введение опровержимой презумпции — один из вариантов решения проблем, связанных, например, с отслеживанием нелегальных финансовых потоков из России». По мнению Алара Лехесметса, представителя эстонской прокуратуры, опровержимая презумпция может повысить успешность будущих расследований. «Однако пока, насколько мы знаем, законодатели не предпринимали шагов в этом направлении», — отметил он. Как говорит Маркко Кюннапу, советник в Минюсте Эстонии, получить доказательства из России было непросто и до того, как война в Украине прервала сотрудничество между странами. Тем не менее, несмотря на неудачу с Swedbank, он считает, что расследовать случаи отмывания денег с предикатными преступлениями в России возможно. ## Многие причастные к расследованию сотрудники Swedbank ушли из банковской сферы Многие банкиры, причастные к делу Swedbank, сменили сферу деятельности. Бывший гендиректор банка Китт возглавляет теплоснабжающую компанию. Состоявший в правлении Раадик — финдиректор Таллинского технического университета. Оба отказались от подробных комментариев из соображений защиты конфиденциальности. «Разбирательство было долгим; если бы у прокуратуры были ко мне какие-то претензии, дело бы не закрыли», — сообщил Раадик OCCRP. Китт сказал, что попавшие к журналистам файлы — «версия одной стороны, то есть обвинения». Адвокат Аверсона говорит, что его клиент сотрудничал со следствием. «Аверсон хочет оставить прошлое позади. Он работает в Эстонии, платит налоги и заботится о своей семье», — добавил он. Представительница эстонского филиала Swedbank сказала, что финансовое учреждение «полностью сотрудничало» с прокуратурами Эстонии и Швеции. Она добавила, что банк «неуклонно соблюдает» протоколы противодействия отмыванию денег. «Swedbank в числе банков с наименьшим уровнем риска на местном рынке и ориентирован на обслуживание местных клиентов», — сказала она. Кург, экс-контролер в Swedbank, руководит частным стартапом в сфере управления рисками. Она говорит, что произошедшее ее не отпускает. «Важно помнить, что контролеры работают не против компании, а преследуют более глобальную цель: защитить бизнес и минимизировать риски, последствия которых могут оказаться разрушительными, — пояснила она. — К сожалению, в случае Swedbank риски материализовались». 12 ноября 2024 г. 12 ноября 2024 г. ### **Присоединяйтесь.** **Привлеките власть к ответу.** [Поддержать](https://membership.occrp.org/accomplice) Поддержка читателей помогает OCCRP разоблачать организованную преступность и коррупцию по всему миру.

Avec l’un des dispositifs les plus robustes et efficaces au monde1, la France poursuit son engagement et s’applique à préserver l’intégrité de son système financier et renforcer l’efficacité de son arsenal de LCB-FT. L’évolution des méthodes de blanchiment de capitaux et de financement du terrorisme (BC-FT) utilisées par les criminels et l’émergence de nouveaux modes opératoires appellent une adaptation continue du cadre législatif et réglementaire. Retour sur un an de LCB-FT – une rétrospective en 3 volets : 1 - [Les nouvelles dispositions et orientations en matière de LCB-FT nées en 2024, au niveau européen et au niveau national](https://www.twobirds.com/fr/insights/2025/france/lcb-ft--retrospective-2024---partie-1) **2 -** **Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires** 3 - Les cryptoactifs, le nouveau hot-topic LCB-FT # Partie 2 : Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires ## 1. Les grands arrêts de la Cour de cassation en matière de blanchiment #### [Crim. 19 juin 2024, FS-B, n° 22-81.808](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000049533701?init=true&page=1&query=22-81.808&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) – Incidences du manquement d’une banque à ses obligations de vigilance en matière LCB-FT. C’est assurément l’arrêt de l’année en la matière – l’avenir dira s’il appartient aux grands arrêts qui ont les honneurs des ouvrages. Dans cet arrêt très commenté2 , la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions dans lesquelles un manquement aux obligations de vigilance imposées au titre de la législation anti-blanchiment était constitutif du délit de blanchiment au sens de l’article 324-1 du Code pénal. D’un côté, elle a pour la première fois expressément affirmé que le seul manquement d’une banque aux obligations de vigilance ne peut constituer un concours apporté à une opération de blanchiment du produit des infractions commises par son client. De l’autre, elle a justifié la condamnation de la banque dès lors qu’au regard des informations dont disposait cette dernière concernant le fonctionnement du compte litigieux, celle-ci ne pouvait ignorer l’origine frauduleuse des fonds y figurant. Dans ces conditions, la mise à disposition d’un compte bancaire dans l’un de ses établissements et l’exécution d’ordres de virement des sommes y figurant vers des comptes à l’étranger, qui sont eux des actes positifs, sont susceptibles de caractériser la participation de la banque à des opérations de blanchiment. Les commentateurs ne pourront certes y voir une responsabilité pour seul manquement aux obligations de vigilance mais les professionnels reconnaitront la finesse de la distinction opérée par la Cour. Celle-ci invite manifestement les établissements bancaires à la plus grande vigilance, dès lors que des fautes d’imprudence ou de négligence, des erreurs d’analyse ou des insuffisances de contrôles, associées à une absence de déclaration ou à une déclaration tardive, pourraient permettre de considérer qu’ils ont apporté, « en connaissance de cause », leur concours à des opérations de blanchiment. #### [Crim. 10 janvier 2024, n°](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) [22-85.721](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Portée limitée de la présomption d’illicéité des sommes objets du délit de blanchiment douanier. Dans cet arrêt, la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions pouvant conduire à une déclaration de culpabilité au titre d’un blanchiment douanier. Après avoir rappelé sa position selon laquelle le cumul des qualifications douanières et pénales pour un même fait ne porte pas atteinte au principe *non bis in idem*, la Cour a censuré la décision insuffisamment motivée des juges du fond qui s’étaient bornés, pour faire application de la présomption posée par l’article 415-1 du Code des douanes, à relever la seule impossibilité de justifier de l’origine et de la licéité des fonds. Il incombait en effet aux juges du fond non seulement de rechercher si les conditions matérielles, juridiques ou financières de l’opération d’exportation, d’importation, de transfert ou de compensation ne paraissaient obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler l’origine illicite des fonds, mais également de rechercher si elles ne paraissaient pas obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler qu’ils étaient le produit d’une des trois catégories3. Le transport sans déclaration ne suffit donc pas à caractériser le produit illicite à l’origine du blanchiment. #### [Crim. 13 mars 2024, n° 22-83.689](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000051553772?init=true&page=1&query=22-83.689&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Caractérisation de la circonstance aggravante d’habitude en matière de blanchiment. Dans cet arrêt, la chambre criminelle a apporté d’utiles précisions sur la circonstance aggravante d’habitude liée à la commission du blanchiment. Pour la première fois, elle affirmé que la circonstance d’habitude, énoncée à l’article 324-2, 1° du Code pénal, ne s’attache pas au blanchiment mais résulte de la multiplication des opérations de conversion et de dissimulation du produit de l’infraction d’origine, et ce peu important que les fonds blanchis proviennent d’un unique délit4 . Le caractère habituel s’attache ainsi non pas au à l’infraction d’origine mais aux éléments matériels du blanchiment. #### [Crim., 16 octobre 2024, n° 23-82.720](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050384866?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.720&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment. La preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment a été abordé dans un arrêt d’octobre 2024. Si les juges du fond peuvent déduire la connaissance par l’agent de l’origine criminelle ou délictuelle de l’opération de blanchiment des circonstances de fait entourant l’acte ou de sa qualité de professionnel, les éléments pris en considération doivent être suffisamment certains. Doit ainsi être censuré l’arrêt qui se fonde sur le motif hypothétique selon lequel *« il parait difficilement concevable qu’en tant que gérante, la prévenue ne se soit pas aperçue des encaissements importantes qui prévalaient sur ses comptes, et des flux financiers qui en découlaient alors qu’elle-même a perçu des sommes en contrepartie des opérations qu’elle effectuait »* pour considérer que celle-ci avait connaissance de l’origine des fonds versés sur son compte bancaire et avait eu l’intention de les dissimuler. On ne peut que saluer ce rappel à la nécessaire rigueur dans l’appréciation des comportements de blanchiment et de l’élément intentionnel, souvent trop vite balayé. #### [Crim. 4 septembre 2024, n° 22-87.061](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050192590?init=true&page=1&query=+22-87.061+&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) et [Crim. 18 septembre 2024, n° 23-82.477](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050290543?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.477&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Rappels en matière de prescription Aux termes de deux arrêts plus confidentiels, la Cour a également a fait quelques rappels utiles en matière de prescription et des délais spécifiques en matière d’infraction occulte ou dissimulée. D’une part, lorsque le délit est occulte ou dissimulé, le point de la prescription doit être reporté à la date de la dénonciation des faits au ministère public ayant permis la révélation du délit. Tel est notamment le cas lorsque les transferts de fonds provenant de délits de blanchiment d’abus de confiance et d’abus de biens sociaux vers des comptes étrangers ont été entrepris selon des modalités destinées à dissimuler tant l’existence des investissements à l’étranger que les revenus générés, notamment à l’aide d’une comptabilité irrégulière et d’opérations financières ou comptables complexes faisant obstacle à tout traçabilité5 . D’autre part, elle précise que l’opération de blanchiment doit s’entendre non seulement de l’opération de placement initial des fonds sur un compte occulte mais également des opérations de réemploi de ces fonds, le tout constituant des opérations de dissimulation, placement et conversion ; de telle sorte que c’est la dernière de ces opérations qui doit être retenue dans la détermination du point de départ du délai de prescription6. ## 2. Répression judiciaire et réglementaire du blanchiment : les affaires qui ont marqué 2024 Les acteurs du monde bancaire et financier, premiers exposés au risque de poursuites et de sanction en matière LCB-FT, n’ont évidemment pas été épargnés par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires, qui ont prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions qui ont attiré notre attention, en France évidemment, mais également à l’étranger. ### 2.1 En France Après une année 2023 marquée par la confirmation de la sanction du géant UBS, 2024 marque la troisième année consécutive qu’une convention judiciaire d’intérêt public (CJIP) est conclue en matière de blanchiment, impliquant un établissement bancaire. Une CJIP a en effet été conclue le 27 août 2024 entre le procureur de la République financier et la société **Danske Bank A/S**, puis validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris le 18 septembre 20247 . Une information judiciaire, ouverte en avril 2015, avait mis en évidence des flux financiers constitutifs de fraude fiscale commis par la gérante de la société Decobat, lesquels transitaient par des comptes ouverts en Estonie, dans des livres de la succursale estonienne de la Danske Bank, la Sampo Bank. La gérante de Decobat avait été condamnée en janvier 2024, par comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité (CRPC), des infractions de fraude fiscale et blanchiment de fraude fiscale. Danske Bank A/S avait quant à elle été mise en examen en février 2019 du chef de blanchiment de fraude fiscale en bande organisée. Il lui était en substance reproché d’avoir ouvert des comptes de passage fictifs destinés à recevoir de l’argent provenant de fraudes fiscales en bande organisée et d’avoir permis que ces comptes soient débités de multiples opérations dépourvues de justification économique, de sorte que ces opérations n’avaient d’autres but que de masquer la destination des fonds détournés et d’en faire bénéficier les destinataires à l’étranger. Le montant de l’amende d’intérêt public (6 028 799 euros) a été validé, notamment *« eu égard à la coopération active de la société, aux mesures correctrices engagées, et à la pertinence des investigations internes menées dans le cadre des poursuites engagées par les régulateurs danois et américains »*. L’intérêt des autorités de poursuites pour les acteurs institutionnels du secteur bancaire et financier a été confirmé par un de ses principaux acteurs : lors d’une récente conférence tenue à l’initiative du Directeur Général des Douanes et des droits indirects, le Procureur de la République Financier a rappelé que *« près 30 % des procédures du PNF visent l’infraction de blanchiment »*, soit au dernier comptage de la synthèse annuelle 2024, près de 230 procédures en cours8 . Ce n’est pas tout : l’autorité judiciaire est par ailleurs concurrencée par les autorités de sanction des régulateurs sectoriels, également très actives en 2024. La commission des sanctions de l’**ACPR** a ainsi rendu trois décisions dans le secteur bancaire, dont deux portant sur des manquements liés à la LCB-FT. La première concerne l’établissement de monnaie électronique **Treezor**, qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un million d’euros pour divers manquements très sérieux, qui affectaient gravement plusieurs éléments fondamentaux du dispositif de LCB-FT9. En particulier, il était reproché à la société de ne pas avoir déterminé, au moment du contrôle, un profil de risque de ses relations d’affaires lui permettant de respecter son obligation de vigilance constante. Son dispositif de surveillance des opérations était par ailleurs, sur de nombreux points, insuffisant. En plus d’une carence de son dispositif à l’origine de déclarations de soupçon tardives, des défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclarations de soupçon ont été relevés par la Commission. La fixation de la sanction pécuniaire a cependant tenu compte, dans le respect du principe de proportionnalité, des importantes actions de remédiation entreprises par Treezor et de sa situation financière. La seconde décision a été prononcée à l’encontre de la Banque régionale d’escompte et de dépôt (**BRED**), qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un montant de 2,5 millions d’euros à raison, outre plusieurs défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclaration de soupçon, de défaillances significatives dans son dispositif de surveillance des opérations. En l’occurrence, celles-ci étaient de nature à affecter sa capacité à identifier et traiter efficacement les opérations atypiques (exclusion de certains comptes du champ du dispositif automatisé de surveillance, paramétrage inapproprié de certains scénarios, informations incomplètes sur le revenu ou le chiffre d’affaires dans la base clients, motivation insuffisante du classement sans suite des alertes, notamment)10. La Commission des sanctions de l’**AMF** a également prononcé plusieurs sanctions en lien avec des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT. Dès janvier 2024, des sanctions pécuniaires ont été infligées à la société **SPI** (20 000 euros) et à son ancien dirigeant (10 0000 euros)11. Était notamment fait grief à la SPI de ne pas avoir disposé d’une procédure LCB-FT opérationnelle (les documents remis par elle à la mission de contrôle étant de simples modèles vierges établis par l’association professionnelle à laquelle elle adhère, lesquels ne peuvent être considérés comme une procédure LCB-FT et, *a fortiori*, opérationnelle) et de ne pas avoir mentionné le niveau de risque du client correspondant à la classification établie par la cartographie figurant dans ce dispositif. Au mois de juin, un blme et une sanction pécuniaire de 10 000 euros ont été prononcées à l’encontre de la société **Activ Finance Conseils**12. Parmi les griefs invoqués, il lui était reproché de ne pas avoir respecté ses obligations en matière de LCB-FT (notamment en ne collectant pas l’intégralité des cartographies des risques et des autres documents par la procédure de LCB-FT qu’elle avait adoptée). L’ensemble des manquements commis par la société ont été imputés à la dirigeant de l’époque, à l’encontre de laquelle un blme a également été prononcé. Un mois plus tard, un avertissement a été prononcé à l’encontre de la société de gestion de portefeuille **Inter Gestion REIM** et de ses dirigeants13. Des sanctions de 300 000 et 15 000 euros ont également été respectivement prononcées à leur égard. En l’occurrence, la société avait manqué à toute une série d’obligations, dont celle d’établir un dispositif LCB-FT adéquat et opérationnel puis d’en assurer l’effectivité (étaient notamment relevés : le caractère lacunaire des diligences effectuées au passif et à l’actif des fonds, l’absence de modalités d’échange automatique d’informations avec l’administration fiscale, ou encore l’absence de formation régulière du personnel). Le 12 septembre 2024, la Commission des Sanction de l’AMF a sanctionné la société de gestion de portefeuille **Sogenial Immobilier** et son président, et prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions pécuniaires d’un montant respectif de 150 000 euros et de 30 000 euros14. La société n’avait, entre autres, pas réalisé toutes les diligences de LCB-FT, ni lors d’investissements réalisés pour le compte des fonds gérés, ni à l’égard de clients ayant souscrit dans une SCPI, et n’avait pas mis en œuvre sa procédure LCB-FT. ### 2.2 À l’étranger Si la France est particulièrement active sur le plan judiciaire et réglementaire dans la lutte contre le blanchiment et la prévention des risques associés, d’autres pays se sont également illustrés cette année, par l’importance, aux plans théorique ou pécuniaire, des sanctions prononcées contre des acteurs du secteur financier. À **Monaco**, quelques mois après l’ajout de la principauté sur la « liste grise » de surveillance renforcée du GAFI, deux anciens banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende de 10 000 euros et à des peines d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir participé dans le blanchiment de millions d’euros déposés en espèces par deux hommes d’affaires italiens. Dans une affaire connexe de l’affaire, trois autres banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende comprise entre 5000 et 7000 euros pour non-déclaration de dépôts en espèces suspects. En **Suisse**, le procès en appel lié à la « Bulgarian Connection » s’était ouvert en automne devant le Tribunal pénal fédéral. La Cour d’appel a finalement acquitté la banque **UBS** – qui avait hérité de cette affaire après l’absorption du Crédit Suisse plus tôt dans l’année – du chef de blanchiment d’argent aggravé. Elle a néanmoins confirmé partiellement les condamnations de deux coprévenus pour leurs activités en lien avec une organisation criminelle bulgare active dans le trafic de stupéfiants et le blanchiment d’argent15. A l’instar de la France, la **Suisse** et les différents membres de l’Union Européenne disposent, à côté des autorités de poursuites judiciaires, de puissants régulateurs du secteur bancaire et financier dont le niveau d’implication dans la poursuite des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT est en constante augmentation, à l’image des sanctions pécuniaires qu’elles imposent. Ainsi, en Suisse, au terme d’une procédure d’*enforcement*, l’Autorité fédérale de surveillance des marchés financiers (FINMA), a prononcé une confiscation de 12,7 millions de francs suisses *« indûment obtenus »* à l’encontre de la banque privée **Mirabaud & Cie SA** pour avoir manqué à ses obligations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et avoir gravement enfreint les règles du droit des marchés financiers. Elle a notamment considéré que la banque n’avait pas suffisamment vérifié et documenté les ayants droit économiques de nombreuses transactions, alors même qu’il existait des indices de risques accrus de blanchiment d’argent et que des signaux d’alertes concernant ces relations d’affaires avaient été émis16 . L’équivalent de la FINMA en **Allemagne**, l’Autorité Fédérale de Supervision Financière (BaFin) a sanctionné la banque **N26 Bank AG** à une amende de 9,2 millions d’euros pour des insuffisances lors de déclarations de soupçons en 2022. Sont notamment reprochés à la banque en ligne des retards systématiques dans la transmission des soupçons de blanchiment d’argent. Cette amende s’ajoute à celle de 4,25 millions d’euros, prononcée en 2021 pour des failles dans son dispositif de prévention du blanchiment. En **Suède**, **Klarna** a été sanctionnée à une amende de 500 millions de couronnes suédoises (près de 45 millions d’euros) par l’autorité de surveillance financière suédoise *(Finansinspektionen)* pour divers manquements. Lui sont reprochées d’importantes lacunes dans l’évaluation générale des risques ainsi que l’absence de procédures et de lignes directrices permettant d’identifier les situations dans lesquelles des mesures de diligence raisonnable devaient être prises pour les clients utilisant leur produit de facturation. L’année 2024 aura également été productive pour la *Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)* britannique, qui a infligé de lourdes amendes pour des manquements à la législation sur le blanchiment d’argent : 16,7 millions de livres sterling (19,2 millions d’euros) à **Metro Bank** pour manquement aux contrôles de lutte contre le blanchiment et défaut de surveillance des transactions ; 3,5 millions de livres sterling (4,1 millions d’euros) à la plateforme de cryptomonnaies **Coinbase** pour des lacunes dans la conception et le suivi des procédures de vérification des clients ; et près de 29 millions de livres sterling (35 millions d’euros) à la banque Starling pour *« laxisme choquant »* dans ses contrôles anti-blanchiment. Si on ignore encore quelle sera la magnitude des dernières lubies du Président américain en matière de lutte contre les infractions économiques et financières (et notamment la « pause » forcée du *Foreign Corrupt Practice Act* (FCPA) annoncée aux premières lueurs de l’année 2025), on se souviendra qu’avant le cataclysme, le DOJ prenait sa part dans l’effort mené par les autorités judiciaires et de régulation dans la lutte contre le blanchiment. La banque canadienne Toronto-Dominion Bank (**TD Bank**) a ainsi accepté de plaider coupable aux Etats-Unis pour une infraction à la législation américaine en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment. Il lui était reproché d’avoir permis à trois réseaux de blanchir plus de 670 millions de dollars et d’avoir manqué à ses obligations de contrôle de des transactions pendant près de 10 ans. La banque doit désormais s’acquitter d’une pénalité de 3 milliards de dollars et modifier ses procédures internes17. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ [1] [Plan d\\'action pour lutter contre le blanchiment de capitaux, le financement du terrorisme et de la prolifération d\\'armes de destruction massive (2021-2022)](https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=CBFBD522-0731-4DBE-919B-3B8E1340F2D1&filename=811%20-%20Plan%20d%27action%20pour%20lutter%20contre%20le%20blanchiment%20de%20capitaux%2C%20le%20financement%20du%20terrorisme%20et%20de%20la%20prolif%C3%A9ration%202021-2022.pdf).

The manager of Decobat was convicted in January 2024 for tax fraud and laundering of tax fraud. Danske Bank A/S was indicted in February 2019 for laundering of organized tax fraud, accused of opening fictitious transit accounts to receive money from organized tax fraud and allowing these accounts to be debited through multiple unjustified transactions to conceal the destination of misappropriated funds and benefit foreign recipients.

How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank?](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/danske-bank-case-money-laundering-scandal-1130#how-modern-tools-prevent-cases-like-danske-bank) Between 2007 and 2015, the global financial system faced one of the most significant [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/anti-money-laundering-aml-49) failures in modern history, in which Danske Bank ([Denmark](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-denmark-245)’s largest financial institution) was implicated in a [money laundering](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/money-laundering-122) scandal amounting to over $230 billion in suspicious transactions. This scandal occurred around the bank’s Estonian branch. It both exposed critical compliance lapses and reshaped how financial institutions and regulators approach AML globally. What Was the Danske Bank Money Laundering Scandal? -------------------------------------------------- Over an eight-year period, suspicious transactions worth over $230 billion flowed predominantly from countries that are outside the EU such as [Russia](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-russia-127), [Azerbaijan](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-azerbaijan-159), and Moldova. The regulatory and AML systems in the Baltic region were actually weak at the time and unsurprisingly, they were exploited in no time. So, how was this done? The majority of these payments were processed through [offshore](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/offshore-1165) entities with minimal scrutiny which enabled illicit actors to funnel vast sums of money through Estonia, all under the guise of legitimacy. How Did the Scandal Come to Light? ---------------------------------- A former employee of Danske Bank’s Estonian branch, Howard Wilkinson acted as an in-formant and revealed systemic issues within the bank’s operations. The most striking insight about the issues was the flagging inadequacies in the handling of non-resident client accounts in 2017. The actual scope of the violations came to light after subsequent investigations by Danish and [Estonian](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-estonia-95) regulators. This was followed by the resignation of the bank’s CEO and involvement of multiple jurisdictions, including the [United States](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/aml-guide/anti-money-laundering-aml-in-united-states-of-america-80) and the United Kingdom, who proceeded to launch formal probes to determine the extent of the misconduct and who was accountable. The revelations unsurprisingly resulted in a sharp decline in Danske Bank. The bank was left with a sharp decline in the reputation, financial penalties and si-gnificant market value losses. [![Image 16: Know your customer is an important companent of anti-money laundering process](https://www.sanctionscanner.com//assets/images/Blog/what-are-the-kyc-and-aml-checks.png)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-aml-kyc-611) Timeline of Key Events ---------------------- Over a period spanning eight years between 2007 and 2015 where the transactions processed totaling $230 billion can be referred as the starting point of the incident. It is followed by the whistleblower report triggering investigations in 2017, the resignation of CEO and the investigations expanding to international scope in 2018 and finally Estonian branch inevitably shutting down operations in 2019. Today, legal proceedings and ensuing penalties still continue. Key Compliance Failures Behind the Scandal ------------------------------------------ So far, we have only briefly touched upon the compliance failures behind this scandal. Since, it is serves as a notable example of how multiple compliance failures may lead up to an International crisis, it would be wise to elaborate the failures behind this scandal. [**Know Your Customer (KYC)**](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/know-your-customer-kyc-46#:~:text=Sanction%20Scanner%20is%20an%20AML,can%20easily%20perform%20KYC%20checks.): First of all, poor Know Your Customer (KYC) certainly didn’t help the Estonian branch. A significant number of non-resident client accounts were accepted and the weak KYC processes, as well as risk assessment failures, created a gateway for illicit activities to occur unchecked. **[Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/what-is-sar-report-149))**: Just like the KYC procedures, ineffective Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) were inadequate as well, both in quantity and timeliness. **Transaction Monitoring Systems**: Another shortcoming was the weak transaction monitoring systems of the bank which resulted in the vast sums of money, which can always be potentially linked to money laundering or other criminal activities, to flow through the system undetected. In addition to these compliance faults, the disconnection between the Copenhagen head office and the Estonian branch certainly didn’t help avoiding a situation like this. The head office couldn’t provide sufficient oversight, auditing and accountability measure, which resulted in local compliance lapses and unaddressed potential misconduct for extended periods of time. ![Image 17](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/Key%20Compliance%20Failures%20Behind%20the%20Scandal.webp) Consequences for Danske Bank ---------------------------- Danske Bank went through several immediate and long-lasting repercussions. It goes without saying that the Estonian branch was forced to shut down operations, thus leaving a significant gap in the regional network. Unfortunately, the damage wasn’t only done to the Estonian branch. Danske Bank’s market value plummeted and key executives were compel-led to resign. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice, European authorities and various financial institutions led several investigations and the bank faced further regulatory fines and legal liabilities but on the bright side, the scandal served as a catalyst for broader AML reforms within the European Union. Why This Case Was a Turning Point for AML in Europe? ---------------------------------------------------- It’s because this scandal acted as a wake-up call for the European Commission and the commission subsequently proceeded to propose the creation of a centralized [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/top-11-aml-tools-for-2025-features-prices-use-cases-1020) regulatory body called AMLA. In addition to the AMLA, financial transaction monitoring systems have shifted to empha-size real-time oversight to enable authorities to quickly detect and mitigate risks associated with transnational money laundering by leveraging advanced technology, such as AI-driven analytics. Financial institutions are now mandated to adopt more detailed and stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols that must include additional verification steps for non-resident and high-risk clients, such as detailed background checks, ongoing monitoring of transac-tional behavior, and enhanced scrutiny for [politically exposed persons (PEPs)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/knowledge-base/politically-exposed-person-pep-56). Another thing that set off the alarm bells was that it demonstrated how urgent it was for financial institutions to adopt a more proactive compliance culture. So, the banks and other entities implemented risk-based strategies tailored to their specific operational environments. Obviously, it depends on the needs of the business but primary examples would be regular staff training, the establishment of clear internal reporting channels, and the use of advanced tools to identify and mitigate risks related to illicit activities. [![Image 18](https://sanctionscanner.com/Content/blog_page_photos/AML-Software-Sanction-Scanner.webp)](https://www.sanctionscanner.com/request-demo) How Modern Tools Prevent Cases Like Danske Bank? ------------------------------------------------ Preventing another scandal of this magnitude requires adopting cutting-edge technological solutions tailored for AML compliance. Luckily, there are tools like Sanction Scanner, which are fine examples of how technology can be used to empower financial institutions to detect and mitigate financial crime risks. Let’s come to the what these technologies can deliver. Real-Time Name Screening, Automated Transaction Monitoring and Comprehensive Risk Assessments serve as good examples that incorporate competent algorithms and AI models.

The case marks a profound turning point for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in the banking sector. The exposure of the scandal revealed that billions of euros were laundered through its Estonian branch. It turned out that the existing AML control mechanisms were far from sufficient to prevent such illegal activities. This realization sparked a compliance revolution aimed at preventing future system failures and preserving the integrity of the financial market. ## The Exposure of a Gigantic Money Laundering Network The Danske Bank scandal embodies one of the most severe cases of money laundering within the European banking sector. The revelation that the bank\\'s Estonian branch served as a hub for dubious money flows caused significant uproar. It painted a picture of convoluted transaction paths, the ends of which were shrouded in darkness. The uncovering of the scandal provided initial hints at this. Over the years, funds amounting to more than 200 billion euros with suspicious origins found their way through the financial institution. Between 2007 and 2015, money laundering activities took place through the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. The scale and complexity of these activities were only fully understood after intense investigations. Thousands of suspicious transactions, involving billions of dollars, were carried out without the necessary AML controls being effective. The Danske Bank affair has exposed the Achilles\\' heel of the financial world: effective mechanisms to prevent money laundering are not only desirable but vital for the integrity of the entire banking system. Internal security systems should be capable of identifying and reporting such massive movements. However, at Danske Bank, these systems failed entirely. This realization has highlighted an urgent need for a profound transformation in the approach to combating money laundering in the European banking sector. Key aspects: * Identification of opaque money flows * Failures in the internal control system * Revision of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) guidelines The significance of the case is partly due to the involvement of a well-known bank: Danske Bank. This has severely impacted its trust among customers and within the financial world. The case prompted a detailed investigation of the incident, scrutinizing the corporate culture and the compliance structure, which proved inadequate for managing money laundering risks. | **Area** | **Description** | **Consequence** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Revelation** | Fake customers and suspicious money flows | Stricter AML regulations and monitoring | | **Financial Volume** | Over €200 billion in suspicious transfers | Investigations and penalties | | **Control Systems** | Failure in detection and reporting | Concerns about risk management infrastructure | | **International Impact** | Affects the reputation of the entire European banking sector | Loss of trust and demands for transparency | ## ## **Scale and Consequences of the Money Laundering Affair** Following the revelation of the money laundering affair, the financial world is now focused on its enormous scope and severe consequences. The suspicious transactions that were uncovered shed light on the existing regulatory deficits in the banking sector and the necessity for effective anti-money laundering measures. ### **Dimensions of the Scandal** The dimensions of the affair are staggering: A gigantic volume of suspicious money transactions remained undetected for years. This indicates that both the financial supervision and the internal control mechanisms of the affected institutions failed. It is clear that despite existing regulations, there was a lack of consistent implementation. ### **Responses from the Financial World and Regulators** The response from the European Central Bank and national financial regulatory authorities was a comprehensive suite of actions. Their measures ranged from tightening regulatory protocols to discussions about ethical responsibility in the financial sector. These incidents have led to a rethinking and the development of new strategies in the fight against money laundering to restore public trust. ### **Economic and Reputational Damage** The reputational damage is immense. The affected bank not only struggled with losses in its stock value but also faced a profound crisis of confidence that questioned the credibility of the entire sector. The long-term effects of this crisis are not yet fully apparent. However, it is clear that comprehensive and sustainable reforms are necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future. These reforms are intended to bolster the integrity and accountability within the financial sector. ## **AML-Anti Money Laundering: Principles and Challenges** Combating money laundering, known as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), is a fundamental pillar in the financial sector. It aims to ensure the integrity and stability of the market. Banks and financial institutions are required to adhere to strict compliance guidelines to efficiently detect and prevent money laundering activities. Effective risk management plays a fundamental role in AML compliance. The identification, assessment, and management of risks are key elements in developing sustainable strategies against these threatening practices. Due diligence procedures, which involve the careful scrutiny of business partners, are also essential to counter potential threats and meet strict regulatory requirements. | **Basic Principle** | **Challenges** | **Strategies** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Customer Identification (KYC)** | Inefficiency in data collection | Automated verification systems | | **Transaction Monitoring** | False positive alerts | Refinement of algorithms | | **Due Diligence Procedures** | Lack of transparency | Extended due diligence checks | | **Suspicious Activity Reporting** | Timely capture of data | Training and clear procedural workflows | | **Risk Assessment** | Changing risk landscape | Dynamic risk models | The challenges in anti-money laundering are diverse and complex. Given the constantly changing methods of money laundering, financial institutions must remain agile and continuously adapt their AML systems. It is not only crucial to identify risks; comprehensive compliance guidelines are decisive in preventing future scandals. They help to strengthen public trust in the banking sector. ## **The European Context and the Role of Instant Payments** The money laundering activities of Danske Bank have exposed the interconnections within the European banking sector. It becomes clear that money laundering is not an isolated problem of a single institution. Rather, it represents a systemic risk that requires a coordinated response at the European and global level. In this context, the role of instant payments must be considered. On one hand, they accelerate payment transactions. On the other hand, they pose new challenges for AML compliance. The integration of effective AML controls into instant payment processes is crucial. ## The Role of Technology and Innovation in AML Compliance With the advent of disruptive technologies, the approach to risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements has fundamentally changed. In the fight against financial crimes such as money laundering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced AML technologies have become indispensable tools. They not only significantly enhance efficiency in AML processes but also contribute substantially to fraud detection and the prevention of financial crimes. ## Laws and Regulations for Combating Money Laundering **Switzerland** In Switzerland, money laundering is combated through the following laws and regulations: **Anti-Money Laundering Act (GwG):** This law, applicable to financial intermediaries, regulates the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It also ensures due diligence in financial transactions. **Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GwV):** This ordinance regulates the professional practice of acting as a financial intermediary. It also sets out the supervisory and reporting obligations for traders. **FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (GWV-FINMA):** This ordinance specifies how financial intermediaries must fulfill their obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. **EU** Money Laundering Directive: The EU\\'s Money Laundering Directive was enacted in 1991 and has been revised several times since then. The EU regulations aim to protect the EU\\'s financial system. It is the responsibility of each EU member state to transpose the Money Laundering Directive into national law. Regulation to Combat Money Laundering: In July 2021, the European Commission presented a package of legislative proposals. These proposals aim to further strengthen and improve the enforcement of EU regulations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT). The package envisages the establishment of an EU authority to combat money laundering, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for credit and financial institutions. Additionally, the package includes regulations on obligations of the private sector and a revised regulation on money transfers. **Germany** Money Laundering Act (GwG): The German Money Laundering Act is the legal implementation of the EU Directive of 2015 and aims at effectively prosecuting money launderers. It has been revised multiple times and has been in its current version since July 2, 2023. Criminal Code (StGB): According to § 261 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), \"money laundering\" is punishable in Germany. Individuals who conceal, use, or dispose of unlawfully acquired assets are committing a criminal offense. The Role of Regulatory Authorities Regulatory authorities such as the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) play a central role in combating money laundering in Switzerland. Similarly, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) plays a crucial role in combating money laundering in Germany. They are responsible for monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations at banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions. Independent asset managers and trustees in Switzerland are indirectly supervised through the Supervisory Organization (SO) by the regulatory authority (AO). In addition, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) exist here, which non-prudentially supervised financial service providers must join. The SROs are in turn approved and supervised by FINMA. In Germany, BaFin also pursues a preventive approach to combating money laundering. The BaFin regulatory authority is supported by the Federal Office for Combating Financial Market Crime (BBF), established in October 2023, as a federal supervisory authority. It consolidates supervision, analysis, and criminal investigations into money laundering matters. The automated functionality of this tool provides a time- and resource-saving way to identify risks. At the same time, it allows the compliance team to focus more on strategic case management. This optimization of workflow ensures efficient use of relevant resources, while companies maintain the highest standards of compliance and risk prevention. ## Future Challenges in Combating Money Laundering The increasing digitization, growing global financial flows, and cryptocurrencies pose new challenges for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). As money laundering is a global issue, addressing it requires not only adapting existing control mechanisms but also enhanced international cooperation. In addition to ongoing adjustments to laws and regulations, there is a need to harmonize them across borders. Strengthening collaboration at the international level is crucial because criminals\\' methods are becoming more sophisticated. Criminals are now utilizing cryptocurrencies for money laundering, adding complexity to detection efforts. Authorities and investigators are placing high hopes on the use of new methods such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in combating money laundering. These new technologies will play a significant role in fraud detection and identifying anomalies in financial transactions. ## Conclusion The harrowing tale of the Danske Bank scandal has exposed a shocking truth about the banking sector, revealing the severe consequences of inadequate AML compliance. Numerous lessons have been drawn from this money laundering affair, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive control mechanisms and transparent financial flows. Banks are challenged not only to react to scandals but to proactively act as elements in the fight against criminal financial activities. The future of AML compliance will increasingly be shaped by digital innovations and the integration of advanced technologies. This requires investments in intelligent solutions capable of identifying and analyzing even the most sophisticated suspicions. The pursuit of a seamless compliance culture generates a growing demand for skilled professionals. These professionals must be trained not only in the analysis of large volumes of data but also in relationship-building and due diligence. Given the events surrounding the Danske Bank, the need for dynamic, adaptable, and internationally coordinated AML policies is evident. The pioneers for a secure banking world in the 21st century are institutions that consider transparency and integrity as part of their corporate philosophy. They view these values not only as legal requirements but as essential elements in restoring public trust. Together, the sector can create resilient structures that are resistant to the threats of financial crime. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening as a Solution The Pythagoras Transaction Screening module is the optimal solution for reviewing incoming and outgoing payments.

It alleges that over €200 billion in suspicious funds were laundered through Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The scandal exposed significant failures in Danske Bank's internal AML (Anti-Money Laundering) control mechanisms, which were insufficient to detect and prevent illegal activities. The case led to investigations, regulatory scrutiny, and penalties, and highlighted the need for stricter AML regulations and improved compliance structures within Danske Bank and the broader European banking sector.

Lenahan-Pfahlert](https://www.ballardspahr.com/people/attorneys/l/lenahan-pfahlert-kelly) on September 4, 2024 Posted in [Civil Penalty](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/civil-penalty/), [Compliance Program](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/compliance-program/), [Correspondent Bank Accounts](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/correspondent-bank-accounts/), [Customer Due Diligence](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/customer-due-diligence/), [New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/new-york-department-of-financial-services/), [Panama Papers](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/panama-papers/), [Transaction Monitoring](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/category/transaction-monitoring/) ![Image 2](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/09/AdobeStock_56312148-656x437.jpeg) On August 27, 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) [announced](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr20240827) a [consent order](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/08/ea20240827-co-nordea.pdf) involving a $35 million settlement with Nordea Bank Abp (“Nordea”) for alleged significant failures related to anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance. Nordea, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, operates globally, including through a licensed branch in New York, [which has its own AML and transaction monitoring requirements](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2017/01/2016-year-in-review-nydfs-finalizes-broad-aml-regulations/). The enforcement action, which followed revelations from the [Panama Papers leak](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/12/first-u-s-indictment-relating-to-panama-papers-charges-lawyer-asset-manager-accountant-and-client/), found that Nordea allegedly failed to conduct proper due diligence on high-risk correspondent banking relationships and maintained inadequate AML controls. According to the NYDFS, the Panama Papers implicated Nordea in aiding clients in establishing offshore shell companies in order to facilitate illicit activities. The consent order alleges that Nordea violated New York law by allowing compliance failures in its AML program and procedures to persist. Meanwhile, [Danish officials recently charged Nordea](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/denmark-takes-nordea-court-possible-breaches-anti-money-laundering-act-2024-07-05/) with repeatedly violating Denmark’s anti-money laundering act between 2012 and 2015, thereby exposing Nordea, potentially, [to extremely significant fines](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/07/11/nordea-risks-money-laundering-fine-near-1-billion-experts-say/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Nordea%20Bank%20could,exceed%20the%20lender%27s%20own%20expectations.). As we will discuss, although the consent order implicates many different issues, the NYDFS enforcement action represents, in part, the latest chapter in the continued fall-out from the [massive AML scandal involving Dankse Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2023/01/sdny-sentences-danske-bank-in-massive-aml-scandal/). The consent order also highlights, once again, the particular risks posed by correspondent banking relationships, on which we repeatedly have blogged (for example, [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2021/03/amla-expands-doj-grand-jury-subpoena-power-over-correspondent-bank-accounts-and-foreign-banks/), [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/10/fincen-solicits-commentary-on-due-diligence-for-correspondent-and-private-bank-accounts/), and [here](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2020/06/28-north-korean-and-5-chinese-bankers-accused-of-a-2-5-billion-laundering-scheme/)). ### _Key Takeaways_ The Consent Order reflects that the NYDFS made the following findings: 1. **Deficient AML Program**: Nordea’s AML program, particularly within its Baltic branches (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and the International Branch in Denmark, exhibited significant deficiencies. These included insufficient policies and procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious activities, exposing the bank to heightened risks of money laundering. 2. **Inadequate Due Diligence**: Nordea failed to conduct adequate due diligence on its correspondent banking relationships. Failure to properly assess the risks associated with the banking parties may have facilitated money laundering. 3. **Insufficient Transaction Monitoring**: Nordea’s transaction monitoring system was inadequate, further exacerbating the risks associated with its AML compliance failures. 4. **High-Risk Transactions**: The NYDFS linked Nordea’s Baltic operations to billions of dollars in high-risk transactions. These transactions underscored the vulnerabilities in the bank’s control mechanisms. 5. **Prior Regulatory Warnings**: Regulatory bodies in Nordic countries previously identified weaknesses in Nordea’s AML compliance programs. Despite these warnings, the bank did not take adequate measures to address the identified issues, allowing the risks to persist. ### _Challenges in the Baltic Branches_ According to NYDFS, Nordea’s Baltic branches faced significant challenges in managing money laundering risks, particularly concerning customers from post-Soviet states with high corruption indices. Despite recognizing these risks, the bank’s efforts to enhance its AML compliance between 2010 and 2017 were insufficient. Audits conducted during this period revealed an overreliance on manual monitoring, inadequate customer identification data, and persistent shortcomings in Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) and Enhanced Due Diligence (“EDD”) processes. These issues left the bank vulnerable to financial crimes. ### _Issues at the International Branch at Vesterport_ Nordea’s International Branch in Vesterport, Denmark (“VIB”), which primarily served corporate customers with connections to Russia and Eastern Europe, was implicated in numerous money laundering scandals, including the Panama Papers, [Russian Laundromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Laundromat), and [Azerbaijani Laundromat](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat). Audits conducted in 2009 and 2013 allegedly identified significant gaps in CDD, EDD, and transaction monitoring processes. These deficiencies, coupled with media scrutiny and increased inquiries from correspondent banks, ultimately led to the branch’s closure in 2014. ### _Nordea’s Correspondent Banking and RMA Relationships_ Nordea maintained extensive correspondent banking relationships and exchanged SWIFT Relationship Management Application (“RMA”) keys with various financial institutions, including Danske Bank, ABLV, and Bank of Cyprus. The NYDFS found that Nordea failed to adequately manage and monitor the risks associated with these relationships. **Danske Bank** [Danske Bank](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2019/03/massive-danske-bank-money-laundering-scandal-continues-to-unfold/), headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, had a significant correspondent banking relationship with Nordea, with substantial annual cross-border payment traffic. Despite adverse findings from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in 2012 and other issues, Nordea assigned Danske an AML risk class “A” rating in 2013. However, internal reviews in 2016 and 2017 identified significant compliance failures, necessitating a downgrade in Danske’s AML risk rating and increased monitoring. **ABLV** ABLV Bank, based in Latvia, [was identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) in 2018 as a primary money laundering concern](https://www.moneylaunderingnews.com/2018/02/fincen-imposes-section-311-fifth-special-measure-on-latvian-bank-ablv/). Despite identifying numerous red flags, Nordea delayed terminating its relationship with ABLV until after FinCEN’s notice. NYDFS determined that this delay exposed Nordea to significant risks and highlighted the need for more timely and effective AML compliance measures. **Bank of Cyprus** The Bank of Cyprus, known for its associations with Russia, allegedly posed substantial money laundering risks. Despite identifying high risks and red flags, NYDFS found that Nordea maintained its relationship with the bank until 2019. Internal audits and KYC reviews allegedly revealed gaps in Nordea’s due diligence regarding the Bank of Cyprus. In 2015, Nordea’s internal audit revealed deficiencies in KYC procedures, including insufficient Politically Exposed Persons (“PEP”) screening, and lack of site visits at the Bank of Cyprus. The KYC file from that year flagged additional risks, including Cyprus’s status as an offshore financial center and ineffective financial oversight. Notably, the file identified three PEPs on the board of Bank of Cyprus, including a former KGB agent and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. It was not until 2023 that Nordea had fully exited its association with the Bank of Cyprus, closing all RMAs except those required by prior guarantees. ### _Transaction Monitoring_ In 2008, Nordea implemented an IT-supported transaction monitoring system, fully operational by 2010. Initially, the system included three monitoring scenarios, expanding to six by 2013, but did not cover correspondent banking transactions. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority identified these deficiencies in 2015, prompting Nordea to introduce 28 new monitoring scenarios in 2016, specifically for correspondent banking risks. Despite these enhancements, Nordea Bank Finland faced challenges integrating transaction data into the automated system, leading to the development of semi-automated controls by mid-2018. Additionally, Nordea allegedly failed to prevent transactions involving ABLV due to delays in updating internal sanctions lists, resulting in breaches of internal sanctions standards. Between 2016 and 2018, flagged transactions related to the Bank of Cyprus were not addressed, and the relationship continued until 2019. NYDFS acknowledged Nordea’s efforts to improve transaction monitoring but noted ongoing significant challenges and areas requiring improvement. ### _The Consent Order_ As part of the settlement, Nordea agreed to several measures to address the deficiencies identified by the NYDFS in addition to the $35 million monetary penalty. These measures include: 1. **Strengthening the AML Compliance Program**: Nordea committed to enhancing its AML policies, procedures, and controls to better detect and prevent money laundering activities. 2. **Enhancing Transaction Monitoring**: The bank agreed to upgrade its transaction monitoring system to more effectively identify and report suspicious activities. 3. **Rigorous Due Diligence on Correspondent Banking Relationships**: Nordea will conduct more thorough due diligence on its correspondent banking partners to ensure compliance with AML standards. 4. **Independent Compliance Review**: An independent consultant will be appointed to assess Nordea’s compliance with the Consent Order, providing recommendations for further improvements and ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon measures. 5. **Regular Progress Reports**: Nordea is required to submit periodic progress reports to the NYDFS, detailing the steps taken to comply with the Consent Order and the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

Der Fall markiert einen tiefgreifenden Wendepunkt für die Anti-Money Laundry (AML)-Richtlinien im Bankensektor. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals offenbarte, dass Milliarden von Euro durch die estnische Filiale gewaschen wurden. Es stellte sich heraus, dass die vorhandenen AML-Kontrollmechanismen bei weitem nicht ausreichten, um derartige illegale Aktivitäten zu unterbinden. Diese Erkenntnis löste eine Compliance-Revolution aus, um ein künftiges Versagen der Systeme zu verhindern und die Integrität des Finanzmarktes zu wahren.** ## Die Enthüllung eines gigantischen Geldwäsche Netzwerkes Der Danske Bank Skandal verkörpert einen der gravierendsten Geldwäsche-Fälle innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors. Hohe Wellen schlug die Enthüllung, dass die estnische Filiale der Bank als Drehscheibe für dubiose Geldflüsse diente. Es entstand ein Bild verschlungener Transaktionskosten, deren Enden sich im Dunklen verloren. Die Aufdeckung des Skandals gab erste Hinweise darauf. Über die Jahre hinweg fanden Gelder in Höhe von mehr als 200 Milliarden Euro mit verdächtiger Herkunft ihren Weg durch das Finanzinstitut. Zwischen 2007 und 2015 fanden Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten statt. Diese Aktivitäten erfolgten über die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank. Ihr Umfang und ihre Komplexität wurden erst nach intensiven Ermittlungen vollends verstanden. Tausende verdächtige Transaktionen, die Milliarden von Dollar umfassten, wurden durchgeführt, ohne dass die erforderlichen AML-Kontrollen greifen konnten. * Die Affäre um die Danske Bank hat die Achillesferse der Finanzwelt blossgestellt: Effektive Mechanismen zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche sind nicht nur wünschenswert, sondern überlebenswichtig für die Integrität des gesamten Bankwesens. Die internen Sicherheitssysteme sollten in der Lage sein, solch massive Bewegungen zu identifizieren und zu melden. Bei der Danske Bank versagten diese jedoch auf ganzer Linie. Diese Erkenntnis trägt dazu bei, dass ein dringender Bedarf für eine tiefgreifende Transformation des Geldwäschebekämpfung Ansatzes im europäischen Bankensektor offengelegt wurde. * **Kennzeichnung undurchsichtiger Geldflüsse** * **Rollen Versäumnisse im internen Kontrollsystem** * **Überarbeitung von AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Richtlinien** Die Brisanz des Falles liegt unter anderem in der Beteiligung einer namhaften Bank: der Danske Bank. Diese sieht ihr Vertrauen bei Kundinnen und Kunden sowie innerhalb der Finanzwelt stark in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Der Fall zog eine detaillierte Untersuchung des Vorfalls nach sich. Dabei wurden die Unternehmenskultur und die Compliance-Struktur unter die Lupe genommen. Sie haben sich als unzureichend für das Management von Geldwäscherisiken erwiesen. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Bereich** | **Beschreibung** | **Konsequenz** | | Enthüllung | Unechte Kunden und verdächtige Geldflüsse | Stärkere AML-Vorgaben und Überwachung | | Finanzielles Volumen | Über 200 Milliarden Euro verdächtige Transfers | Untersuchungen und Strafen | | Kontrollsysteme | Versagen bei der Erkennung und Meldung | Bedenken zur Risikomanagement Infrastruktur | | Internationale Wirkung | Betrifft Reputation des gesamten Europäischen Bankensektors | Vertrauensverlust und Forderung nach Transparenz | ## ## Ausmass und Folgen der Geldwäsche-Affäre Nach dem Bekanntwerden der Geldwäsche-Affäre stehen die enorme Tragweite und die schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen im Fokus der Finanzwelt. Die aufgedeckten verdächtigen Transaktionen werfen ein Licht auf das bestehende Regulierung Defizit im Bankensektor und die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Geldwäschebekämpfung. ### Dimensionen des Skandals Die Dimensionen der Affäre sind erschütternd: Ein gigantisches Volumen an verdächtigen Geldtransaktionen blieb über Jahre hinweg unentdeckt. Dies zeigt, dass die Finanzaufsicht und die internen Kontrollmechanismen der betroffenen Institute versagt haben. Dies macht deutlich, dass es trotz existierender Vorschriften an einer konsequenten Umsetzung mangelte. ### Reaktionen der Finanzwelt und Regulatoren Die Antwort der Europäischen Zentralbank und der nationalen Finanzaufsichtsbehörden war ein Arsenal an Reaktionen. Ihre Massnahmen reichten von der Verschärfung der Regulierungsmassnahmen bis hin zur Diskussion über ethische Verantwortung im Finanzsektor. Diese Vorfälle haben zu einem Umdenken geführt. Es wurden neue Strategien im Kampf gegen die Geldwäsche entwickelt, um das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit wiederherzustellen. ### Wirtschaftliche und Reputationsschäden Der Reputationsschaden ist gewaltig. Die betroffene Bank hatte nicht nur mit Wertverlusten ihrer Aktien zu kämpfen. Sie stand ausserdem vor einer tiefgreifenden Vertrauenskrise, die die Glaubwürdigkeit des gesamten Sektors in Frage stellte. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Krise sind noch nicht vollständig absehbar. Jedoch ist klar, dass umfassende und nachhaltige Reformen notwendig sind. Diese Reformen sollen ähnliche Vorfälle in der Zukunft verhindern. ## ## AML-Anti Money Laundering: Grundsätze und Herausforderungen Die Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche, bekannt als Anti-Geldwäsche (AML), ist eine zentrale Säule im Finanzsektor. Sie dient dazu, die Integrität und Stabilität des Marktes zu gewährleisten. Banken und Finanzinstitutionen sind hierbei angehalten, strikte Compliance-Richtlinien zu befolgen, um Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten effizient aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Ein wirksames **Risikomanagement** spielt eine grundlegende Rolle in der AML-Compliance. Die Identifikation, Bewertung und Steuerung von Risiken sind Schlüsselelemente, um nachhaltige Strategien gegen diese bedrohlichen Praktiken zu entwickeln. Due-Diligence-Verfahren, die sorgfältige Überprüfung von Geschäftspartnern, sind ebenfalls unerlässlich, um potenzielle Bedrohungen abzuwehren und den strengen regulatorischen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Grundprinzip** | **Herausforderungen** | **Strategien** | | Kundenidentifizierung ([KYC](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/partner-screening/?hsLang=de)) | Ineffizienz bei der Datenerhebung | Automatisierte Verifizierungssysteme | | [Transaction Monitoring](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-monitoring/?hsLang=de) | Falsch-Positive Meldungen | Verfeinerung von Algorithmen | | Due-Diligence-Verfahren | Mangel an Transparenz | Erweiterte Due-Diligence-Checks | | Meldung von Verdachtsfällen | Zeitgerechte Erfassung | Schulungen und klare Prozessabläufe | | Risikobewertung | Veränderliche Risikolandschaft | Dynamische Risikomodelle | Die Herausforderungen in der Anti-Geldwäsche sind vielfältig und komplex. Angesichts ständig ändernder Methoden der Geldwäsche müssen Finanzinstitutionen agil bleiben und ihre AML-Systeme kontinuierlich anpassen. Nicht nur das Aufspüren der Risiken spielt eine entscheidende Rolle. Die ganzheitlichen Compliance-Richtlinien sind ausschlaggebend, um zukünftige Skandale zu verhindern. Sie tragen dazu bei, das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in den Bankensektor zu stärken. ## Der europäische Kontext und die Rolle der Instant Payments Die Geldwäsche-Aktivitäten der Danske Bank haben die Verflechtungen innerhalb des europäischen Bankensektors offengelegt. Es wird deutlich, dass Geldwäsche kein isoliertes Problem einer einzelnen Institution ist. Vielmehr stellt sie ein systemisches Risiko dar, das eine koordinierte Antwort auf europäischer und globaler Ebene erfordert. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die Rolle von Instant Payments zu betrachten. Diese beschleunigen einerseits den Zahlungsverkehr. Andererseits stellen sie neue Herausforderungen für die AML-Compliance dar. Die Integration von effektiven AML-Kontrollen in Instant Payment-Prozesse ist von entscheidender Bedeutung. ## Die Rolle von Technologie und Innovation bei der AML-Compliance Mit dem Aufkommen disruptiver Technologien hat sich die Herangehensweise an das Risikomanagement und die Einhaltung von Compliance-Vorschriften grundlegend gewandelt. Bei der Bekämpfung von Finanzverbrechen wie Geldwäsche avancieren Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und fortschrittliche AML-Technologien zu unverzichtbaren Instrumenten. Sie bieten nicht nur eine deutliche Effizienzsteigerung in den AML-Prozessen, sondern tragen erheblich zur Betrugserkennung und zur Prävention finanzieller Delikte bei. ## Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Geldwäschebekämpfung #### Schweiz In der Schweiz wird die Geldwäscherei durch folgende Gesetze und Verordnungen bekämpft: [Geldwäschereigesetz (GwG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/892_892_892/de): Das für Finanzintermediäre geltende Geldwäschereigesetz regelt die Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei und Terrorismusfinanzierung. Ausserdem regelt es die Sicherstellung der Sorgfalt bei Finanzgeschäften. Geldwäschereiverordnung (GwV): Die Vorschriften für die berufsmässige Ausübung der Tätigkeit als Finanzintermediär werden in dieser Verordnung geregelt. Ebenso sind die Aufsichts- und Meldepflichten für Händlerinnen und Händler darin festgelegt. [Geldwäschereiverordnung-FINMA](https://www.finma.ch/de/ueberwachung/branchenuebergreifende-themen/geldwaeschereibekaempfung/#:~:text=Aufsichtsrechtliche%20Geldw%C3%A4schereibek%C3%A4mpfung,im%20Rahmen%20ihrer%20prudenziellen%20Aufsicht.) (GWV-FINMA): Diese Verordnung legt fest, wie Finanzintermediäre die Pflichten zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umsetzen müssen. #### EU Geldwäscherichtlinie: Die Geldwäscherichtlinie der EU wurde 1991 erlassen und seitdem mehrmals überarbeitet. Die EU-Vorschriften dienen dazu, das Finanzsystem der EU zu schützen. Jedem EU-Mitgliedstaat obliegt es, die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie in nationales Recht umzusetzen. Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche: Im Juli 2021 legte die Europäische Kommission ein Paket mit Gesetzgebungsvorschlägen vor. Diese Vorschläge zielen auf die weitere Stärkung und bessere Durchsetzung der EU-Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AML/CFT) ab. Das Paket sieht vor, eine EU-Behörde zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche zu errichten, die einen Regelungsrahmen für Kredit- und Finanzinstitute schaffen soll. Ausserdem enthält das Paket Verordnungen über Verpflichtungen des privaten Sektors und eine überarbeitete Verordnung über Geldtransfers. #### Deutschland Geldwäschegesetz (GwG): Das deutsche Geldwäschegesetz ist die rechtliche Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinie von 2015 und zielt auf eine wirksame strafrechtliche Verfolgung von Geldwäschern ab. Es wurde mehrmals überarbeitet und ist in der aktuellen Fassung seit dem 02.07.2023 in Kraft. Strafgesetzbuch (StGB): Laut § 261 des deutschen StGB ist „Geldwäsche“ in Deutschland strafbewehrt. Personen, die unrechtmässig erworbene Vermögenswerte verschleiern, nutzen oder verbringen, machen sich strafbar. #### **Die Rolle von Aufsichtsbehörden** Aufsichtsbehörden wie die Schweizer Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FINMA) spielen bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäscherei in der Schweiz eine zentrale Rolle. Ähnlich ist es mit der deutschen Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), die in Deutschland eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche einnimmt. Ihnen obliegt die Überwachung der Einhaltung der Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche bei Banken, Wertpapierhäusern und weiteren Finanzinstituten. Unabhängige Vermögensverwalter und Trustees werden in der Schweiz über die Aufsichtsbehörde (AO) indirekt überwacht. Daneben existieren hier Selbstregulierungsorganisationen (SRO), denen sich nicht prudentiell überwachte Finanzdienstleister anschliessen müssen. Die SROs werden wiederum von der FINMA genehmigt und beaufsichtigt. In Deutschland verfolgt die BaFin ebenfalls einen präventiven Ansatz zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Der Aufsichtsbehörde BaFin steht das im Oktober 2023 gegründete Bundesamt zur Bekämpfung von Finanzmarkt-Kriminalität (BBF) als Bundesoberbehörde zur Seite. In ihm werden Aufsicht, Analyse und strafrechtliche Ermittlung in Sachen Geldwäsche gebündelt. Die automatisierte Funktionalität dieses Tools bietet eine zeit- und ressourcenschonende Möglichkeit zur Risikoidentifizierung. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht es dem Compliance-Team, sich verstärkt auf das strategische Fallmanagement zu fokussieren. Diese Optimierung des Arbeitsablaufs gewährleistet eine effiziente Nutzung relevanter Ressourcen und Unternehmen halten gleichzeitig höchste Standards in Bezug auf Compliance und Risikoprävention aufrecht. ## Zukünftige Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung Die zunehmende Digitalisierung, wachsende globale Geldströme und Kryptowährungen stellen Anti-Money Laundering vor neue Herausforderungen. Da sich Geldwäsche als globales Problem darstellt, erfordert dies nicht nur eine Anpassung bestehender Kontrollmechanismen, sondern mehr internationale Zusammenarbeit. Neben der laufenden Anpassung von Gesetzen und Vorschriften gilt es, diese über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu harmonisieren. Um die Zusammenarbeit auf internationaler Ebene zu verstärken. Dies ist notwendig, weil die Methoden von Kriminellen raffinierter werden. Inzwischen setzen sie Kryptowährungen für Geldwäsche ein. Grosse Hoffnungen verbinden Behörden und Fahnder mit dem Einsatz neuer Methoden wie der Künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und Machine Learning bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung. Bei der Betrugserkennung und Aufdeckung von Anomalien bei Finanztransaktionen werden die neuen Technologien eine wichtige Rolle spielen. ## Fazit Die unheilvolle Geschichte des Danske Bank Skandals hat eine schockierende Wahrheit über den Bankensektor aufgedeckt. Sie hat aufgezeigt, welche gravierenden Konsequenzen mangelnde AML-Compliance nach sich zieht. Aus dieser Geldwäsche-Affäre sind zahlreiche Lektionen gezogen worden. Diese Lektionen betonen die Bedeutung von umfassenden Kontrollmechanismen und transparenten Finanzströmen. Banken stehen vor der Herausforderung, nicht bloss als Reaktion auf Skandale zu handeln. Vielmehr müssen sie als proaktives Element im Kampf gegen kriminelle Finanzaktivitäten agieren. Die Zukunft der AML-Compliance wird zunehmend von digitalen Innovationen und der Integration fortschrittlicher Technologien geprägt sein. Dies erfordert Investitionen in intelligente Lösungen, welche in der Lage sind, auch die raffiniertesten Verdachtsmomente zu identifizieren und zu analysieren. Das Streben nach einer lückenlosen Compliance-Kultur erzeugt eine steigende Nachfrage nach Fachkräften. Diese Fachkräfte müssen sowohl in der Analyse grosser Datenmengen geschult sein, als auch verstärkt in Beziehungsarbeit und Due-Diligence-Prüfung. In Anbetracht der Ereignisse rund um die Danske Bank ist die Notwendigkeit von dynamischen, anpassungsfähigen und international abgestimmten AML-Richtlinien offensichtlich. Die Wegbereiter für eine sichere Bankenwelt im 21. Jahrhundert sind Institute, die Transparenz und Integrität als Teil ihrer Unternehmensphilosophie betrachten. Sie sehen diese Werte nicht nur als gesetzliche Anforderung. Das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit kann durch das kollektive Bemühen aller Beteiligten wiederhergestellt werden. Gemeinsam kann der Sektor zukunftssichere Strukturen schaffen. Diese Strukturen müssen widerstandsfähig gegenüber den Bedrohungen durch Finanzkriminalität sein. ## Pythagoras Transaction Screening als Lösung Das Pythagoras [Transaction Screening](https://pythagoras-solutions.com/transaction-screening/?hsLang=de) Modul ist die optimale Lösung für die Prüfung ein- und ausgehender Zahlungen.

Für Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, die Feinheiten zu verstehen. ### Definition und Grundlagen der Geldwäsche Geldwäsche ist der Prozess, bei dem illegal erzielte Erlöse als legal erscheinen. Es ist eine Methode, die von Kriminellen verwendet wird, um ihre Aktivitäten und das damit verbundene Geld zu verschleiern und die Erträge aus ihren Verbrechen legitim erscheinen zu lassen. Dies wird oft durch eine komplexe Abfolge von Banküberweisungen oder kommerziellen Transaktionen erreicht, was die Rückverfolgung der ursprünglichen Geldquelle schwierig macht. Einige gut dokumentierte Beispiele für Geldwäsche sind die Verwendung von Bargeld für den Kauf von Lebensversicherungspolicen und deren anschließendes Verfallenlassen, der Kauf und Verkauf wertvoller Vermögenswerte wie Kunst und die Verwendung von [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) zur Verschleierung des Eigentums und des Transfers von Geldern, insbesondere im Immobiliensektor. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen bei [der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"handelsbasierte Geldwäsche\") und der Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen (MSBs) sind ebenfalls gängige Methoden zur Geldwäsche. ### Die Phasen der Geldwäsche Das Verständnis der [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) ist entscheidend, um diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Diese Phasen umfassen in der Regel die Platzierung, das Layering und die Integration. **Platzierung**: Dies ist der Prozess der Einführung des illegalen Geldes in das Finanzsystem. Dies kann durch die Aufteilung großer Bargeldbeträge in weniger auffällige kleinere Summen geschehen, die dann direkt auf ein Bankkonto eingezahlt werden, oder durch den Kauf einer Reihe von Instrumenten (wie Schecks oder Zahlungsanweisungen), die dann gesammelt und auf Konten an einem anderen Ort eingezahlt werden. **Schichtung**: In dieser Phase führt der Geldwäscher in der Regel eine Reihe von Umrechnungen oder Bewegungen der Gelder durch, um sie von ihrer Quelle zu entfernen. Das Layering kann aus mehreren Bank-zu-Bank-Überweisungen, Überweisungen zwischen verschiedenen Konten mit unterschiedlichen Namen in verschiedenen Ländern, Ein- und Auszahlungen bestehen, um den Geldbetrag auf den Konten kontinuierlich zu ändern, die Währung des Geldes zu ändern und hochwertige Gegenstände (wie Häuser oder Unternehmen) zu kaufen, um die Form des Geldes zu ändern. Dies wird manchmal als [komplexe Schichtung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) bezeichnet. **Integration**: Die letzte Phase des Prozesses. In der [Integrationsphase](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) gelangt das Geld in legitim aussehender Form wieder in die Mainstream-Ökonomie – es scheint aus einem legalen Geschäft zu stammen. Dabei kann es sich um eine abschließende Überweisung auf das Konto eines lokalen Unternehmens handeln, in das der Geldwäscher im Austausch für eine Gewinnkürzung „investiert“, um den Verkauf einer Immobilie, die während der Schichtungsphase gekauft wurde, oder einfach um die Ausgabe von Geld, das für Luxusgüter gewaschen wurde. Durch das Verständnis der Grundlagen der Geldwäsche und ihrer Phasen können sich Fachleute besser darauf vorbereiten, diese Aktivitäten zu erkennen und zu verhindern, die entscheidende Aspekte der [Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind. ## Ein Blick auf Beispiele aus dem wirklichen Leben Um die Dynamik der Geldwäsche besser zu verstehen, schauen wir uns Beispiele aus der Praxis an. Diese Fälle, in denen es um Lebensversicherungen, die Kunstwelt und Briefkastenfirmen im Immobilienbereich geht, enthüllen die komplizierten Strategien, mit denen illegale Gelder verschleiert werden. ### Geldwäsche durch Lebensversicherung Eine Methode der Geldwäsche sind Lebensversicherungen. Einzelpersonen verwenden Bargeld, um diese Policen zu kaufen, dann Kredite gegen sie aufzunehmen und schließlich die Policen verfallen zu lassen. Diese zirkuläre Methode verschleiert die Herkunft der Gelder und verleiht dem illegalen Bargeld einen Anstrich von Legitimität ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dieses Beispiel unterstreicht die Bedeutung von [Know-Your-Customer- (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) und [Kunden-Due-Diligence-Verfahren](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) im Versicherungssektor als Schlüsselkomponenten der [Anti-Geldwäsche-Compliance](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/). ### Geldwäsche in der Kunstwelt Die Kunstwelt ist ein weiterer Bereich, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Kriminelle kaufen und verkaufen wertvolle Kunstwerke, um die Herkunft des bei diesen Transaktionen verwendeten Bargelds zu verschleiern. Der hohe Wert von Kunstwerken, gepaart mit der subjektiven Natur ihrer Preisgestaltung, macht dies zu einem fruchtbaren Boden für Geldwäschesysteme. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit strenger Kontrollen und Transparenz bei hochwertigen Kunsttransaktionen. ### Briefkastenfirmen und Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen, insbesondere solche, an [denen Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) beteiligt sind, sind ein weiterer häufiger Kanal für Geldwäsche. Kriminelle kaufen Immobilien oft mit Bargeld und verschleiern ihr Eigentum durch Briefkastenfirmen oder versteckten Immobilienbesitz, um die Spur der Gelder zu verwischen und die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft zu erschweren ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). In einigen Fällen werden Immobilienbewertungen manipuliert, und Kriminelle arbeiten mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese illegale Praxis ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. In einem bemerkenswerten Fall hat ein Mann aus Honduras über 1 Million US-Dollar an Bestechungsgeldern durch internationale Überweisungen gewaschen, um Immobilien in New Orleans zu kaufen, darunter auch Büroräume ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). In einem anderen Fall soll eine Privatbank einem Konto des Vatikans erlaubt haben, 350 Millionen Dollar für Investitionen in Londoner Immobilien auszugeben und damit illegale Immobilientransaktionen zu erleichtern, darunter auch solche von Drogenhändlern, um Immobilien in Bulgarien zu kaufen ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, wie wichtig die Transparenz der [wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) bei Immobilientransaktionen ist und wie wichtig strenge Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in diesem Sektor sind. Sie heben auch die Herausforderungen hervor, mit denen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden bei der Verfolgung des Flusses illegaler Gelder konfrontiert sind, und die zentrale Rolle des [Offshore-Bankwesens](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) bei Geldwäschesystemen. ## Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche Handelsbasierte Geldwäsche ist eine komplexe Form der Finanzkriminalität, bei der Handelstransaktionen genutzt werden, um illegal verdientes Geld zu verstecken, zu bewegen und zu investieren. Es ist neben Layering und Integration eine der drei grundlegenden Methoden der Geldwäsche, die alle in unserem Artikel über die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) untersucht werden können. ### Falsche Darstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen Bei handelsbasierter Geldwäsche werden der Preis, die Menge oder die Qualität von Waren oder Dienstleistungen falsch dargestellt, um Werte zwischen Ländern zu transferieren und die illegale Geldquelle zu verbergen ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Diese Methode kann sowohl in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/) verwendet werden, um komplexe Transaktionsschichten zu erstellen, als auch in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/) , um das gewaschene Geld wieder in die legale Wirtschaft einzuführen. Die Falschdarstellung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen kann verschiedene Formen annehmen, wie z. B. Überfakturierung, Unterfakturierung, Mehrfachrechnungsstellung oder falsche Beschreibung von Waren oder Dienstleistungen. Diese betrügerischen Praktiken werden häufig durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) und verschleierte [wirtschaftliche Eigentümerstrukturen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) erleichtert, was es den Behörden erschweren kann, diese Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu untersuchen. ### Fallstudien zur handelsbasierten Geldwäsche Ein bemerkenswertes Beispiel für handelsbasierte Geldwäsche war eine kriminelle Organisation, die unterbewertete Waren und gefälschte Rechnungen verwendete, um 1,8 Millionen US-Dollar an schmutzigem Geld zu waschen ([UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). In diesem Fall kaufte die Organisation Waren in einem Land zu einem niedrigen Preis und verkaufte sie dann in einem anderen Land zu einem viel höheren Preis. Die Preisdifferenz wurde zur Geldwäsche des Schwarzgeldes verwendet. Dieser Fall erinnert eindringlich daran, wie wichtig robuste Verfahren zur [Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) sind, einschließlich einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und einer kontinuierlichen Überwachung von Transaktionen. Durch das Verständnis der Techniken, die bei der handelsbasierten Geldwäsche eingesetzt werden, können Fachleute, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, die mit dieser Art von illegalen Aktivitäten verbundenen Risiken besser erkennen und [mindern](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Minderung der Risiken\") . Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit einer kontinuierlichen Wachsamkeit und wirksamer Kontrollen im globalen Handelssektor. Da sich die von Kriminellen verwendeten Methoden ständig weiterentwickeln, ist es für Unternehmen von entscheidender Bedeutung, auf dem Laufenden zu bleiben und ihre [Strategien zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche\") entsprechend anzupassen. Durch das Verständnis der Taktiken, die bei der Geldwäsche angewendet werden, können Fachleute ihre Organisationen besser schützen und zum globalen Kampf gegen Finanzkriminalität beitragen. ## Missbrauch von Gelddienstleistungsunternehmen Money Services Businesses (MSBs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle im globalen Finanzsystem und bieten Dienstleistungen wie Geldtransfer, Währungsumtausch und Scheckeinlösung an. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist jedoch zu einem erheblichen Problem bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche geworden, da diese Unternehmen die Bewegung von Geldern ohne angemessene Prüfung oder behördliche Aufsicht erleichtern können ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Nicht registrierte Geldübermittler Im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche nutzen Kriminelle häufig nicht registrierte Geldübermittler, eine Untergruppe von MSBs, aus, um illegale Gelder zu bewegen, ohne die Aufmerksamkeit der Behörden auf sich zu ziehen ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese nicht registrierten Unternehmen operieren unter dem Radar und umgehen die strengen Vorschriften und [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden,](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) denen traditionelle Finanzinstitute unterliegen. Überweisungen, die über diese nicht registrierten MSBs getätigt werden, hinterlassen möglicherweise keine Aufzeichnungen, was es schwierig macht, die ursprüngliche Quelle oder den endgültigen Bestimmungsort der Gelder zurückzuverfolgen. Dies macht sie zu einem idealen Kanal während der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/), in der das Ziel darin besteht, die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern. Die relative Leichtigkeit und Anonymität, die nicht registrierte Geldübermittler bieten, macht sie attraktiv für Kriminelle, die diese Dienste nutzen, um Geld unentdeckt über Grenzen zu bewegen. Dies ist eine große Herausforderung für [die weltweiten Bemühungen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche.](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) ### Fallstudien zum MSB-Missbrauch Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist leider keine Seltenheit, wobei zahlreiche Fälle auf der ganzen Welt verzeichnet wurden. So ist beispielsweise bekannt, dass Kriminelle MSBs nutzen, um Geld aus illegalen Aktivitäten wie Drogenhandel, Betrug und organisierter Kriminalität zu waschen. In vielen Fällen werden diese illegalen Gelder über nicht registrierte MSBs bewegt, was es für die Behörden schwierig macht, die Transaktionen zu erkennen und zurückzuverfolgen. Der Missbrauch von MSBs ist eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie wichtig eine solide regulatorische Aufsicht im Finanzsektor ist. Es unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit effektiver [Know-Your-Customer-Verfahren (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) einer strengen Überwachung von Transaktionen und einer gründlichen Due-Diligence-Prüfung, um einen solchen Missbrauch zu verhindern. Der Kampf gegen Geldwäsche ist kontinuierlich, wobei ständig neue Methoden und Techniken entstehen. Indem sie diese [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/) verstehen und daraus lernen, können sich Aufsichtsbehörden, Compliance-Beauftragte und Finanzinstitute besser darauf vorbereiten, illegale Geldflüsse in Zukunft zu erkennen und zu verhindern. ## Geldwäsche durch Immobilien Immobilientransaktionen bieten Kriminellen eine effektive Möglichkeit, illegale Gelder zu waschen. Die hochwertigen Transaktionen des Sektors in Kombination mit den oft komplexen rechtlichen und finanziellen Vereinbarungen stellen eine attraktive Gelegenheit für Kriminelle dar, die versuchen, ihre unrechtmäßig erworbenen Gewinne zu legitimieren. ### Kauf und Verkauf von Immobilien Eine gängige Methode, die Kriminelle anwenden, besteht darin, Immobilien mit Bargeld zu erwerben und deren Eigentum dann durch [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) oder verstecktes Eigentum zu verbergen ([Sanktionsscanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Diese Methode verwischt die Spur der Gelder und erschwert die Rückverfolgung ihrer illegalen Herkunft, was die Strafverfolgungsbehörden vor Herausforderungen stellt. Eine weitere Strategie ist die Manipulation von Immobilienbewertungen. Kriminelle arbeiten oft mit Immobilienmaklern oder Gutachtern zusammen, um Immobilien zu unter- oder überbewerten. Diese Taktik ermöglicht es ihnen, Kredite zu erwerben oder den gewaschenen Betrag durch überhöhte Immobilienwerte zu maximieren. Kriminelle gründen auch Briefkastenfirmen in ausländischen Gerichtsbarkeiten, um Immobilien zu besitzen, was den grenzüberschreitenden Fluss illegaler Gelder erleichtert. Diese Methode erschwert es den Behörden, den Geldfluss zu verfolgen, und zeigt eine Methode, mit der Geldwäscheaktivitäten verschleiert werden. ### Fallstudien zur Geldwäsche im Immobilienbereich Immobiliengeldwäsche ist ein globales Problem. Laut einem Bericht von Global Financial Integrity (GFI) wurden von 2015 bis 2021 mehr als 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar über US-Immobilien gewaschen. Dies unterstreicht, dass Immobilien nach wie vor eine der beliebtesten Möglichkeiten sind, illegale Gelder zu bewegen. Ein weiteres Beispiel: In den letzten zehn Jahren flossen etwa 20 Milliarden US-Dollar in den Immobilienmarkt im Großraum Toronto in Kanada, ohne dass die Anti-Geldwäsche-Behörden eine angemessene Prüfung durchführten ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Region | Gewaschene Menge (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | USA | 2,3 Milliarden US-Dollar | | Großraum Toronto, Kanada | 20 Milliarden US-Dollar | Diese Beispiele unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Wachsamkeit und wirksamer [Einhaltung der Geldwäschebekämpfung](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) im Immobiliensektor. Wenn sie die Taktiken von Kriminellen verstehen und sich der [Warnsignale](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Rote Fahnen\") bewusst sind, können Fachleute im Immobiliensektor eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Unterbrechung dieser illegalen Finanzströme spielen. Für diejenigen, die in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität tätig sind, kann das Verständnis dieser [Geldwäschebeispiele](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) helfen, potenzielle Risiken zu identifizieren und effektive [Sorgfaltspflichten gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) zu implementieren. ## Geldwäsche-Skandale Trotz strenger [Compliance-Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) und behördlicher Kontrollen tauchen immer wieder Fälle von Geldwäsche in großem Maßstab auf. Schauen wir uns einige bemerkenswerte Geldwäscheskandale an, die in den letzten Jahren Schlagzeilen gemacht haben. ### Das FinCEN-Dateileck Im Jahr 2020 enthüllte das Durchsickern der FinCEN-Dateien (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) ein riesiges Netzwerk von Finanzkorruption. Über 400 Journalisten aus 88 Ländern arbeiteten an dieser Untersuchung zusammen und deckten verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von erstaunlichen 2 Billionen US-Dollar auf. Diese geheimen Dateien enthielten Informationen über Transaktionen, die von Banken als verdächtig gekennzeichnet wurden, aber fortgesetzt werden durften. Der Bericht hob schwerwiegende Versäumnisse in den globalen Bankensystemen hervor, die es ermöglichten, große Geldsummen ohne angemessene Kontrollen zu bewegen. Das FinCEN-Files-Leck unterstrich die Bedeutung einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der rigorosen Durchsetzung von [Know Your Customer (KYC)-](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) Vorschriften. Der Fall ist eine eindringliche Erinnerung an das potenzielle Ausmaß und die Komplexität von Geldwäscheoperationen. ### Das Panama-Papers-Leak Das Leak der Panama Papers im Jahr 2016 war eine monumentale Enthüllung, die zahlreiche aufsehenerregende Fälle von Geldwäsche, Steuerhinterziehung und Umgehung internationaler Sanktionen enthüllte. Das Leck betraf Banken, Anwaltskanzleien und hochkarätige Einzelpersonen weltweit und enthüllte das Ausmaß illegaler Finanzaktivitäten, die durch [Offshore-Banken](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/entwirrung-des-offshore-bankings-untersuchung-der-feinheiten-des-globalen-finanzwesens/) und [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/) verschleiert wurden. Die Panama Papers hoben den Missbrauch anonymer Briefkastenfirmen hervor, um [wirtschaftliches Eigentum](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/die-macht-der-transparenz-nutzung-des-wirtschaftlichen-eigentums-bei-der-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Schichtungsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/enthullung-der-komplexitat-verstandnis-der-schichtungsphase-der-geldwasche/). Infolgedessen führte der Skandal zu Forderungen nach mehr Transparenz bei Offshore-Finanzdienstleistungen und strengeren Vorschriften zur Identifizierung der wirtschaftlichen Eigentümer. ### Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon Der „Troika-Waschsalon“-Skandal umfasste die Geldwäsche von 4,6 Milliarden US-Dollar über ein Netzwerk von Scheinfirmen und illegale Finanztransaktionen zwischen 2006 und 2013. An diesem System waren mehrere Parteien in verschiedenen Gerichtsbarkeiten beteiligt, was die globale Reichweite von Geldwäscheoperationen zeigt. Der Skandal um den Troika-Waschsalon brachte den Missbrauch von Briefkastenfirmen ans Licht, um die Herkunft illegaler Gelder zu verschleiern, eine gängige Taktik in der [Integrationsphase der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/moneys-disguise-untersuchung-der-integrationsphase-der-geldwasche/). Der Skandal führte zu Ermittlungen und rechtlichen Schritten, was die Bedeutung der globalen Zusammenarbeit bei der Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche weiter unterstreicht. Jeder dieser Skandale unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche und die anhaltende Notwendigkeit von Wachsamkeit und Durchsetzung. Durch die Untersuchung dieser „Geldwäschebeispiele“ können Fachleute in den Bereichen Compliance, Risikomanagement und Bekämpfung von Finanzkriminalität ein tieferes Verständnis für die von Geldwäschern angewandten Taktiken erlangen und erfahren, wie diese illegalen Aktivitäten aufgedeckt und verhindert werden können. ## Aus Geldwäschefällen lernen Das Verständnis realer Szenarien ist eine der effektivsten Möglichkeiten, den komplexen Prozess der Geldwäsche zu verstehen. Dieser Abschnitt wirft einen genaueren Blick auf einige der bedeutendsten Geldwäschebeispiele der jüngeren Geschichte, um wertvolle Einblicke in den Ablauf dieser Ereignisse und die daraus gezogenen Lehren zu geben. ### Der Fall Wachovia Bank Im Jahr 2010 war die Wachovia Bank in eine umfangreiche Geldwäscheoperation verwickelt, an der mexikanische Drogenkartelle beteiligt waren. Zwischen 2004 und 2007 ermöglichte die Bank über ihre Filialen die Geldwäsche von fast 390 Milliarden US-Dollar. Die illegalen Gelder, die aus dem Drogenhandel in den USA stammten, wurden über die mexikanische Grenze geschmuggelt und später auf die US-Konten von Wachovia zurücküberwiesen. Die Bank hat es versäumt, die Herkunft dieser Gelder zu überprüfen und ist damit ihren [Know Your Customer (KYC)-Verpflichtungen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/kyc-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-finanzkriminalitat/) nicht nachgekommen. Anstelle einer Strafverfolgung zahlte Wachovia eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 160 Millionen US-Dollar und versprach, seine [Verfahren zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche (AML)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/starkung-ihres-unternehmens-aufbau-eines-starken-compliance-rahmens-zur-bekampfung-von-geldwasche/) zu verbessern. ### Der Standardfall der Chartered Bank Die Standard Chartered Bank wurde wegen wiederholter Verstöße gegen US-Sanktionen mit hohen Strafen belegt. Nachdem die Bank 2012 zunächst mit einer Geldstrafe von 670 Millionen US-Dollar wegen Verstößen gegen den Iran belegt worden war, wurde sie 2019 erneut beschuldigt, Sanktionen gegen Länder wie Simbabwe, Burma, Iran, Sudan, Kuba und Syrien ignoriert zu haben. Für diese Verstöße verhängten die US-amerikanischen und britischen Behörden eine Geldstrafe von insgesamt 1,1 Milliarden US-Dollar gegen Standard Chartered und unterstrichen damit die schwerwiegenden Folgen einer Missachtung des Völkerrechts. ### Der Fall Danske Bank Die estnische Filiale der Danske Bank diente zwischen 2007 und 2015 als Kanal für geschätzte 228 Milliarden US-Dollar an gewaschenen Geldern. Dieser Skandal, in den Tausende von verdächtigen Kunden verwickelt waren, lenkte die Aufmerksamkeit der Öffentlichkeit auf die Compliance-Versäumnisse der Bank. Die dänischen Behörden verhängten Geldstrafen in Höhe von insgesamt 2 Millionen US-Dollar und wiesen mehreren Managern der Bank die Schuld zu. ### Der Fall BCCI Die Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) war an Betrugs [– und Geldwäscheaktivitäten](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) in Höhe von insgesamt bis zu 23 Milliarden US-Dollar beteiligt. Die BCCI nutzte ausgeklügelte Geldwäschesysteme wie [Briefkastenfirmen](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/inside-the-web-erkundung-der-dunklen-welt-der-briefkastenfirmen/), Datenschutzoasen, Provisionen und Bestechung. Die Schließung der Bank im Jahr 1991 führte zu zahlreichen rechtlichen Schritten, darunter die Klage der BCCI gegen die Bank of England wegen Nachlässigkeit bei der Identifizierung von Frühwarnzeichen. Dieser Fall unterstreicht die Bedeutung robuster AML-Compliance-Programme ([Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Diese Beispiele für Geldwäsche unterstreichen die Bedeutung strenger AML-Verfahren, einer gründlichen [Sorgfaltspflicht gegenüber Kunden](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/de/sorgfaltspflicht-gegenuber-kunden-ihr-schutzschild-gegen-geldwasche/) und der Notwendigkeit, die [Phasen der Geldwäsche](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) zu verstehen, um Finanzkriminalität aufzudecken und zu verhindern. Indem sie aus diesen Fällen lernen, können Fachleute im Bereich Compliance und Risikomanagement ihre Unternehmen besser auf ähnliche Situationen vorbereiten und schützen.

The AMLA requires FinCEN to pay an award of [**up to 30 percent of collected monetary sanctions**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/money_laundering_whistleblower_reward/) that it recovers in a judicial or administrative action brought under the Bank Secrecy Act that results in sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The SEC can also **[pay awards to whistleblowers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/sec-whistleblower-program/)** for disclosing a broker-dealer’s failure to file [suspicious activity reports](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/report_reference.pdf), maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program, or establish an adequate customer identification program. In addition, the SEC can take an enforcement action against a mutual fund for a violation of Rule 38a-1, which requires investment companies to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws by the funds, which includes the Bank Secrecy Act.

In December 2022, [Danske Bank agreed to pay $413 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-220) to settle charges that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading investors about its AML compliance program in its Estonian branch and failing to disclose the risks posed by the program’s significant deficiencies. Danske Bank has agreed to pay more than $2 billion as part of an integrated, global resolution with the SEC, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Denmark’s Special Crime Unit. And in February 2018, [U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank paid $613 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/u-s-bancorp-agrees-to-pay-528-million-over-money-laundering) in fines and forfeitures to settle charges that it failed to maintain adequate safeguards against money laundering. In particular, U.S. Bancorp/U.S. Bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious and processed Western Union transactions for non-customers. ## **SEC and FINRA Continue to Prioritize Anti-Money Laundering Compliance** The SEC’s [2024 examination priorities](https://www.sec.gov/files/2024-exam-priorities.pdf) clarify that the SEC continues to focus on AML compliance: > The BSA requires certain financial institutions, including broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies, to establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs that are tailored to address the risks associated with the firm’s location, size, and activities, including the customers they serve, the types of products and services offered, and how those products and services are offered. These programs must, among other things, include policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the BSA and its implementing rules; independent testing; and risk-based procedures to perform customer due diligence (as required by the Customer Due Diligence rule), which includes identifying and verifying the identity of customers and conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. Where appropriate, certain financial institutions must also file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. SARs can be used to detect and combat market manipulation, insider trading, Ponzi schemes, corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and a variety of other illicit activities potentially violative of securities and other laws and regulations. > > **The Division will continue to focus on AML programs to review whether broker-dealers and certain registered investment companies are: (1) appropriately tailoring their AML program to their business model and associated AML risks; (2) conducting independent testing; (3) establishing an adequate customer identification program, including for beneficial owners of legal entity customers; and (4) meeting their SAR filing obligations.** > **Examinations of certain registered investment companies will also review policies and procedures for oversight of applicable financial intermediaries. Also, the Division will review whether broker-dealers and advisers are monitoring** **Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and ensuring compliance with such sanctions.** # **Broker-Dealer Anti-Money Laundering Requirements** The primary [anti-money laundering regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.210) for brokers or dealers require, among other things, the establishment and implementation of an anti-money laundering program, which includes, at a minimum: * Policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance; * Independent testing for compliance; * Monitoring of the operations and internal controls of the program; * Ongoing training for appropriate persons; and * Appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, which includes: + Establishing, documenting, and maintaining a written [Customer Identification Program](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.220); and + Continuous monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions. In the event that a broker-dealer identifies a suspicious transaction, the firm is [required to file a SAR](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1023.320) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In the SAR’s narrative section, broker-dealers must “[p]rovide a clear, complete and chronological description . . . of the activity, including what is unusual, irregular or suspicious about the transactions(s).” Broker-dealers violate federal securities laws (specifically, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8) when they: * Fail to file SARs; or * File inaccurate SARs (e.g., incomplete narratives, incomplete critical field information, incomplete identification of suspicious activity, etc.). These violations deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information that could be used to identify potential securities law and money laundering violations. # **SEC and FINRA AML Enforcement Actions** * In September 2023, the SEC iharged registered investment adviser DWS Investment Management Americas Inc. (DIMA or DWS), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, for its failure to develop a mutual fund Anti-Money Laundering program. To settle the charges, DIMA agreed to pay a total of [$25 million in penalties](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-194). The SEC’s [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/ia-6431.pdf) also found that DIMA caused such mutual funds’ failure to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect activities indicative of money laundering and to conduct AML training specific to the mutual funds’ business. * In September 2023, the SEC charged a registered representative at a registered broker-dealer with [failing to report suspicious and unusual transactions in a brokerage account](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-98418-s) of his long-time customer to the AML group of the brokerage firm where he worked, which caused the firm to fail to timely file a SAR in violation of the federal securities laws. * In May 2016, FINRA fined Raymond James & Associates and Raymond James Financial Services **[$17 million](https://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/finra-fines-raymond-james-us17m-206217)** for widespread violations related to their anti-money laundering programs. The violations stemmed from the firms’ failure to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering programs, which in turn precluded the firms from meeting their duty to prevent, detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity from at least November 2011 through June 2014. * In December 2016, FINRA fined Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC [**$16.5 million**](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/CreditSuisse_AWC_120516.pdf?utm_source=MM&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=NewsRelease_120516_FINAL) for “significant deficiencies” in its anti-money laundering program. According to FINRA, Credit Suisse’s program failed to effectively monitor/detect suspicious trading and money movements from at least January 2011 through December 2015. As a result, Credit Suisse was unable to determine whether to file required SARs. * In January 2015, Oppenheimer & Company paid [**$10 million**](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/33-9711.pdf) to settle an action by the SEC and FinCEN for failure to file SARs. According to the SEC’s complaint, Oppenheimer’s anti-money laundering program identified suspicious activity that needed to be “escalated” immediately. Specifically, the activity stemmed from an account that: “(i) was a foreign broker-dealer doing business in the U.S.; (ii) selling ‘low-priced stock’ on behalf of customers; and (iii) that it immediately wired the proceeds out of the Oppenheimer account.” Despite these and other red flags, Oppenheimer failed to file SARs with FinCEN. * In February 2016, the SEC fined E.S. Financial Services [**$1 million**](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-23.html) for violating anti-money laundering laws by “allowing foreign entities to buy and sell securities without verifying the identities of the non-U.S. citizens who beneficially owned them.” As mentioned, federal securities laws require broker-dealers to establish, document, and maintain a written Customer Identification Program. ## **SEC AML Enforcement** In a July 2023 Risk Alert, EXAMS staff observed certain weaknesses in OFAC compliance programs, including instances in which entities did not adopt or implement reasonable, risk-based internal controls for 1. following-up on potential matches with the sanctions lists and documenting the outcome of such follow-up; 2. performing periodic or event-based screening of existing clients or customers based on, among other things, changes in ownership or to the sanctions lists; and 3. conducting OFAC searches in a timely manner (or documenting that such searches were completed). The alert encourages registrants to review and strengthen the policies, procedures, and internal controls of their AML programs to further their compliance with federal AML rules and regulations, and to monitor for amendments, pursuant to the AMLA and the Corporate Transparency Act.

According to the SEC’s [complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2017/comp-pr2017-112.pdf), Alpine failed to adequately file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for at least 1,950 stock transactions that the firm flagged as suspicious. The SEC found that Alpine’s “records contained information reflecting material red flags of money laundering, securities fraud, or other illicit financial activities relating to its customers and their transactions,” and that Alpine “routinely and systematically failed to identify and report suspicious activity in its SAR filings.” The SEC charged Alpine with thousands of violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8, and sought an order requiring Alpine to pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, which provides for penalties ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 for each violation The SEC’s complaint reveals that the SEC also charged many of Alpine’s customers with federal securities laws violations, including violations relating to transactions that cleared through Alpine. ## **SEC Whistleblower Program Pays More than $1.8 Billion in Awards to Whistleblowers** In 2010, Congress created the [**SEC Whistleblower Program**](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/) to “motivate those with inside knowledge to come forward and assist the Government to identify and prosecute persons who have violated securities laws and recover money for victims of financial fraud,” S.

About Battle Over Corporate Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/whistleblower-attorney-jason-zuckerman-quoted-battle-corporate-whistleblower-rules/) In 2020, the SEC announced that “Anti-Money Laundering” was on the agency’s [List of Examination Priorities](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/national-examination-program-priorities-2020.pdf). The SEC’s examination priorities “reflect certain practices, products, and services that [SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations] perceives to present potentially heightened risk to investors and/or the integrity of the U.S. capital markets.” In the priority list, the SEC clarifies that it will continue to scrutinize broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs by: * Examining the appropriateness and effectiveness of broker-dealers’ anti-money laundering programs; * Reviewing how broker-dealers are monitoring for suspicious activity; and * Assessing broker-dealers’ compliance with SAR requirements. In 2016, the SEC [announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/inside-the-national-exam-program-in-2016.html) that it would share more of its oversight responsibilities of the broker-dealer industry with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Since 2017, and in lockstep with the SEC, FINRA included “Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity Monitoring” on its [2020 Annual Regulatory and Examination Priorities Letter](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/communications-firms/2020-risk-monitoring-and-examination-priorities-letter). Both the SEC and FINRA have increased enforcement actions against broker-dealers for anti-money laundering program violations. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and implementing regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), require that broker-dealers file SARs with FinCEN to report a transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part) conducted or attempted by, at, or through the broker-dealer involving or aggregating to at least $5,000 that the broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect: (1) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is conducted to disguise funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade any requirement of the BSA; (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts; or (4) involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal activity. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(a)(2) (the “SAR Rule”). Broker-dealers are required to file the SAR 30 calendar days after the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR under the SAR Rule. 31 C.F.R. § 1023.320(b)(3). In cases where the broker-dealer cannot identify a suspect, it must file the SAR within 60 days of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. Id. Exchange Act Rule 17a-8 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission to comply with the reporting, record-keeping, and record retention requirements of the BSA. The failure to timely file a SAR as required by the SAR Rule is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act. * [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=linkedin) * [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=twitter) * [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=facebook) * [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/uncategorized/money-laundering-sec-whistleblower-program/?share=tumblr) Categories: [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-program/), [Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Protection Law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-protection-law/), [Money Laundering Whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [SEC Whistleblower Attorney](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-attorney/), [SEC Whistleblower Award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower cases](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-cases/), [SEC whistleblower lawyers](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-lawyers/), [SEC Whistleblower Program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-program/), [SEC Whistleblower Rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/sec-whistleblower-rules/), [Uncategorized](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/uncategorized/), [Whistleblower Bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounties/), [whistleblower bounty](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-bounty/), [Whistleblower Rewards](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/category/whistleblower-rewards/) Tags: [AML compliance whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-compliance-whistleblower/), [AML whistleblower lawyer](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/aml-whistleblower-lawyer/), [AMLA whistleblower law](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/amla-whistleblower-law/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower bounties](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-bounties/), [anti-money laundering whistleblower reward program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblower-reward-program/), [anti-money laundering whistleblowing](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/anti-money-laundering-whistleblowing/), [broker dealer fraud whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/broker-dealer-fraud-whistleblower/), [money laundering whistleblower](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/money-laundering-whistleblower/), [reporting money laundering to SEC](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/reporting-money-laundering-to-sec/), [sec whistleblower award](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-award/), [SEC whistleblower program](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-program/), [sec whistleblower rules](https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/tag/sec-whistleblower-rules/) ### About the authors Matthew Stock is the Director of the Whistleblower Rewards Practice at Zuckerman Law.

Il est essentiel que les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière en comprennent les subtilités. ### Définition et principes de base du blanchiment d’argent Le blanchiment d’argent est le processus qui consiste à faire paraître légal le produit de l’argent illégal. Il s’agit d’une méthode utilisée par les criminels pour dissimuler leurs activités et l’argent en jeu, en faisant apparaître le produit de leurs crimes comme légitime. Cela se fait souvent par le biais d’une séquence complexe de virements bancaires ou de transactions commerciales, ce qui rend difficile le traçage de la source d’origine des fonds. Parmi les exemples bien documentés de blanchiment d’argent, citons l’utilisation d’espèces pour acheter des polices d’assurance-vie et les laisser ensuite expirer, l’achat et la vente d’actifs de valeur comme des œuvres d’art, et l’utilisation de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) pour dissimuler la propriété et le transfert de fonds, en particulier dans le secteur immobilier. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services dans le [cadre du blanchiment d’argent axé sur le commerce](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/trade-based-money-laundering-methods/ \"Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce\") et l’utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) sont également des méthodes courantes utilisées pour blanchir de l’argent. ### Les étapes du blanchiment d’argent Comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) est crucial pour détecter et prévenir cette activité illicite. Ces étapes comprennent généralement le placement, la superposition et l’intégration. **Placement** : Il s’agit du processus d’introduction de l’argent illicite dans le système financier. Cela peut être fait en divisant de grandes quantités d’argent en petites sommes moins visibles qui sont ensuite déposées directement dans un compte bancaire, ou en achetant une série d’instruments (tels que des chèques ou des mandats) qui sont ensuite collectés et déposés dans des comptes à un autre endroit. **Superposition** : À ce stade, le blanchisseur d’argent s’engage généralement dans une série de conversions ou de mouvements des fonds pour les éloigner de leur source. La superposition peut consister en plusieurs virements bancaires, des virements bancaires entre différents comptes à des noms différents dans différents pays, des dépôts et des retraits pour faire varier continuellement le montant d’argent sur les comptes, changer la devise de l’argent et acheter des articles de grande valeur (tels que des maisons ou des entreprises) pour changer la forme de l’argent. C’est ce qu’on appelle parfois [la superposition complexe](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). **Intégration** : La dernière étape du processus. Au [stade de l’intégration](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/), l’argent réintègre l’économie traditionnelle sous une forme d’apparence légitime – il semble provenir d’une transaction légale. Il peut s’agir d’un virement bancaire final sur le compte d’une entreprise locale dans laquelle le blanchisseur « investit » en échange d’une part des bénéfices, de la vente d’une propriété achetée pendant la phase de superposition ou simplement de la dépense d’argent qui a été blanchi pour des produits de luxe. En comprenant les bases du blanchiment d’argent et ses étapes, les professionnels peuvent mieux s’outiller pour détecter et prévenir ces activités, qui sont des aspects cruciaux de la [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ## Regarder des exemples concrets Pour mieux comprendre la dynamique du blanchiment d’argent, penchons-nous sur des exemples concrets. Ces affaires, impliquant l’assurance-vie, le monde de l’art et les sociétés écrans dans l’immobilier, dévoilent les stratégies complexes employées pour dissimuler des fonds illicites. ### Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’assurance-vie L’une des méthodes de blanchiment d’argent consiste à souscrire des polices d’assurance-vie. Les particuliers utilisent de l’argent comptant pour acheter ces polices, puis empruntent sur celles-ci et finissent par laisser les polices expirer. Cette méthode circulaire obscurcit l’origine des fonds et donne un vernis de légitimité à l’argent illicite ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Cet exemple souligne l’importance des procédures de [connaissance du client (KYC)](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) et de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle dans le secteur de l’assurance en tant qu’éléments clés de [la conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/). ### Le blanchiment d’argent dans le monde de l’art Le monde de l’art est un autre domaine vulnérable au blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent et vendent des œuvres d’art de valeur pour masquer l’origine de l’argent utilisé dans ces transactions. La valeur élevée des œuvres d’art, associée à la nature subjective de leur prix, en fait un terrain fertile pour les stratagèmes de blanchiment d’argent. Cela met en évidence la nécessité de contrôles rigoureux et de transparence dans les transactions d’œuvres d’art de grande valeur. ### Sociétés fictives et biens immobiliers Les transactions immobilières, en particulier celles impliquant [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), sont un autre canal courant de blanchiment d’argent. Les criminels achètent souvent des biens immobiliers en utilisant de l’argent comptant et dissimulent leur propriété par le biais de sociétés fictives ou de propriétés cachées afin d’obscurcir la piste des fonds et de compliquer la recherche de leurs origines illicites ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-launder-money.asp)). Dans certains cas, les évaluations immobilières sont manipulées et les criminels collaborent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette pratique illicite leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Dans un cas notable, un Hondurien a blanchi plus d’un million de dollars de pots-de-vin par virement bancaire international pour acheter des propriétés à la Nouvelle-Orléans, y compris des espaces de bureaux ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Dans un autre cas, une banque privée aurait permis à un compte appartenant au Vatican de dépenser 350 millions de dollars pour investir dans l’immobilier londonien, facilitant ainsi les transactions immobilières illégales, y compris celles effectuées par des trafiquants de drogue pour acheter des propriétés en Bulgarie ([ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/real-estate-money-laundering/)). Ces exemples illustrent l’importance de la transparence des [bénéficiaires effectifs](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans les transactions immobilières et la nécessité de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur. Ils soulignent également les défis auxquels sont confrontés les organismes chargés de l’application de la loi pour retracer les flux de fonds illicites et le rôle central des [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) dans les systèmes de blanchiment d’argent. ## Blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce est une forme complexe de criminalité financière qui utilise des transactions commerciales pour cacher, déplacer et investir de l’argent gagné illicitement. C’est l’une des trois méthodes fondamentales de blanchiment d’argent, avec la superposition et l’intégration, qui peuvent toutes être explorées dans notre article sur les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/). ### Fausse déclaration de biens ou de services Le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce consiste à faire de fausses déclarations sur le prix, la quantité ou la qualité de biens ou de services afin de transférer de la valeur entre les pays et de dissimuler la source illicite des fonds ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022015/what-methods-are-used-lauter-money.asp)). Cette méthode peut être utilisée à la fois à [l’étape de la stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour créer des couches complexes de transactions et à [l’étape d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/) pour réintroduire l’argent blanchi dans l’économie légitime. La fausse déclaration de biens ou de services peut prendre plusieurs formes, telles que la surfacturation, la sous-facturation, la facturation multiple ou la description mensongère de biens ou de services. Ces pratiques frauduleuses sont souvent facilitées par [des sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) et des structures de [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dissimulées, ce qui peut rendre difficile pour les autorités de détecter ces activités et d’enquêter sur celles-ci. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent lié au commerce Un exemple notable de blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce concerne une organisation criminelle qui utilise des biens sous-évalués et de fausses factures pour blanchir 1,8 million de dollars d’argent sale ([ONUDC](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-4/key-issues/money-laundering.html)). Dans ce cas, l’organisation a acheté des biens dans un pays à bas prix, puis les a vendus dans un autre pays à un prix beaucoup plus élevé. La différence de prix a été utilisée pour blanchir l’argent illicite. Cette affaire nous rappelle brutalement l’importance de solides procédures de [conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) , y compris une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard de la clientèle et une surveillance continue des transactions. En comprenant les techniques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent basé sur le commerce, les professionnels travaillant dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux identifier et [atténuer les risques](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/risk-control-techniques-pcdd/ \"Atténuer les risques\") associés à ce type d’activité illicite. Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent mettent en évidence la nécessité d’une vigilance continue et de contrôles efficaces dans le secteur du commerce mondial. Alors que les méthodes utilisées par les criminels continuent d’évoluer, il est crucial pour les organisations de rester informées et d’adapter leurs stratégies [de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/course/certificate-in-anti-money-laundering-and-know-your-customer-foundations/ \"Lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent\") en conséquence. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées dans le blanchiment d’argent, les professionnels peuvent mieux protéger leurs organisations et contribuer à la lutte mondiale contre la criminalité financière. ## Utilisation abusive d’entreprises de services monétaires Les entreprises de services monétaires (ESM) jouent un rôle crucial dans le système financier mondial, offrant des services tels que le transfert d’argent, le change de devises et l’encaissement de chèques. Cependant, l’utilisation abusive des ESM est devenue une préoccupation importante dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, car ces entreprises peuvent faciliter le mouvement de fonds sans examen ou surveillance réglementaire appropriés ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). ### Transmetteurs d’argent non enregistrés Dans le contexte du blanchiment d’argent, les criminels exploitent souvent des émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés, un sous-ensemble d’ESM, pour transférer des fonds illicites sans attirer l’attention des autorités ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces entités non enregistrées opèrent sous le radar, contournant les réglementations strictes et les procédures de [diligence raisonnable à l’égard](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) de la clientèle auxquelles les institutions financières traditionnelles sont soumises. Les transferts effectués par l’intermédiaire de ces ESM non inscrites peuvent ne pas laisser de traces, ce qui rend difficile la reconstitution de la source d’origine ou de la destination finale des fonds. Cela en fait un canal idéal pendant la [phase de stratification du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/), où l’objectif est de dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites. La relative facilité et l’anonymat offerts par les émetteurs de fonds non enregistrés les rendent attrayants pour les criminels, qui utilisent ces services pour transférer de l’argent au-delà des frontières sans être détectés. Il s’agit d’un défi de taille pour les efforts [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le monde entier. ### Études de cas d’utilisation abusive d’ESM L’utilisation abusive des ESM n’est malheureusement pas rare, avec de nombreux cas enregistrés à travers le monde. Par exemple, les criminels sont connus pour utiliser les ESM pour blanchir de l’argent provenant d’activités illégales telles que le trafic de drogue, la fraude et le crime organisé. Dans de nombreux cas, ces fonds illicites transitent par des ESM non enregistrées, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de détecter et de retracer les transactions. L’utilisation abusive des ESM est un rappel brutal de l’importance d’une surveillance réglementaire rigoureuse dans le secteur financier. Il souligne la nécessité de mettre en place des procédures efficaces de [connaissance du client (KYC),](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) un suivi rigoureux des transactions et une diligence raisonnable approfondie pour prévenir de tels abus. La lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent est continue, avec de nouvelles méthodes et techniques qui émergent constamment. En comprenant et en tirant des leçons de ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/money-laundering-examples/), les organismes de réglementation, les responsables de la conformité et les institutions financières peuvent mieux s’équiper pour détecter et prévenir les flux d’argent illicites à l’avenir. ## Blanchiment d’argent par le biais de l’immobilier Les transactions immobilières offrent aux criminels un moyen efficace de blanchir des fonds illicites. Les transactions de grande valeur du secteur, combinées aux montages juridiques et financiers souvent complexes qu’elles impliquent, représentent une opportunité intéressante pour les criminels qui cherchent à légitimer leurs gains mal acquis. ### Achat et vente d’une propriété Une méthode courante employée par les criminels consiste à acheter des biens immobiliers en espèces, puis à dissimuler leur propriété par le biais de [sociétés fictives](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/) ou de propriétés cachées ([scanner de sanctions](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). Cette méthode obscurcit la piste des fonds et complique la recherche de leurs origines illicites, ce qui pose des défis aux organismes d’application de la loi. Une autre stratégie consiste à manipuler les évaluations immobilières. Les criminels collaborent souvent avec des agents immobiliers ou des évaluateurs pour sous-évaluer ou surévaluer les propriétés. Cette tactique leur permet d’obtenir des prêts ou de maximiser le montant blanchi grce à des valeurs immobilières gonflées. Les criminels établissent également des sociétés fictives dans des juridictions étrangères pour posséder des biens immobiliers, ce qui facilite le mouvement transfrontalier de fonds illicites. Cette méthode rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux de fonds, ce qui démontre une méthode utilisée pour dissimuler des activités de blanchiment d’argent. ### Études de cas sur le blanchiment d’argent immobilier Le blanchiment d’argent dans le secteur immobilier est un problème mondial. Selon un rapport de Global Financial Integrity (GFI), plus de 2,3 milliards de dollars ont été blanchis dans l’immobilier américain entre 2015 et 2021. Cela montre à quel point l’immobilier reste l’un des moyens les plus populaires de transférer des fonds illicites. Autre exemple, au cours de la dernière décennie, environ 20 milliards de dollars sont entrés sur le marché immobilier dans la région du Grand Toronto au Canada sans que les autorités de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ne fassent l’objet [d’un examen minutieux (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/money-laundering-through-real-estate-318)). | Région | Quantité blanchie (2015 – 2021) | | --- | --- | | États-Unis | 2,3 milliards de dollars | | Grand Toronto, Canada | 20 milliards de dollars | Ces exemples soulignent l’importance de la vigilance et de la conformité efficace en [matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) dans le secteur immobilier. En comprenant les tactiques utilisées par les criminels et en étant conscients des [signaux d’alarme](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/red-flags-in-transaction-monitoring/ \"Signaux d’alarme\"), les professionnels du secteur immobilier peuvent jouer un rôle essentiel dans la perturbation de ces flux financiers illicites. Pour ceux qui travaillent dans les domaines de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière, comprendre ces [exemples de blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) peut aider à identifier les risques potentiels et à mettre en œuvre des procédures efficaces [de diligence raisonnable à l’égard de la clientèle](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) . ## Scandales de blanchiment d’argent Même avec la mise en place de mesures strictes [de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) et de contrôles réglementaires, des cas de blanchiment d’argent à grande échelle continuent de faire surface. Examinons quelques scandales notables de blanchiment d’argent qui ont fait la une des journaux ces dernières années. ### La fuite des fichiers FinCEN En 2020, la fuite des FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) Files a révélé un vaste réseau de corruption financière. Plus de 400 journalistes de 88 pays ont collaboré à cette enquête, découvrant un montant stupéfiant de 2 000 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes. Ces fichiers secrets contenaient des informations sur des transactions signalées comme suspectes par les banques, mais qui ont été autorisées à se poursuivre. Le rapport a mis en évidence de graves défaillances dans les systèmes bancaires mondiaux, permettant de transférer d’importantes sommes d’argent sans contrôles adéquats. La fuite des FinCEN Files a souligné l’importance d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et d’une application rigoureuse des réglementations [KYC (Know Your Customer).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) L’affaire est un rappel brutal de l’ampleur et de la complexité potentielles des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. ### La fuite des Panama Papers La fuite des Panama Papers en 2016 a été une révélation monumentale qui a révélé de nombreux cas très médiatisés de blanchiment d’argent, d’évasion fiscale et de contournement des sanctions internationales. La fuite a impliqué des banques, des cabinets d’avocats et des personnalités de premier plan dans le monde entier, révélant l’étendue des activités financières illicites dissimulées par le biais de [banques offshore](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/demeler-les-services-bancaires-offshore-examen-des-subtilites-de-la-finance-mondiale/) et de [sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/). Les Panama Papers ont mis en évidence l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives anonymes pour dissimuler la [propriété effective](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-pouvoir-de-la-transparence-exploiter-la-propriete-effective-dans-le-domaine-de-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/), une tactique courante dans la [phase de superposition du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/devoiler-les-complexites-comprendre-letape-de-stratification-du-blanchiment-dargent/). En conséquence, le scandale a suscité des appels à une plus grande transparence dans les services financiers offshore et à une réglementation plus stricte pour identifier les bénéficiaires effectifs. ### Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka Le scandale de la « Troïka Laundromat » a impliqué le blanchiment de 4,6 milliards de dollars par le biais d’un réseau de fausses entreprises et de transactions financières illicites entre 2006 et 2013. Ce stratagème a impliqué de multiples parties dans différentes juridictions, ce qui montre la portée mondiale des opérations de blanchiment d’argent. Le scandale des laveries automatiques de la Troïka a mis en lumière l’utilisation abusive de sociétés fictives pour dissimuler l’origine des fonds illicites, une tactique courante dans la [phase d’intégration du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/deguisement-de-largent-exploration-de-letape-dintegration-du-blanchiment-dargent/). Le scandale a donné lieu à des enquêtes et à des actions en justice, soulignant davantage l’importance de la coopération mondiale dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. Chacun de ces scandales souligne l’importance de mesures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et la nécessité constante de faire preuve de vigilance et d’application de la loi. En étudiant ces « exemples de blanchiment d’argent », les professionnels de la conformité, de la gestion des risques et de la lutte contre la criminalité financière peuvent mieux comprendre les tactiques employées par les blanchisseurs d’argent et la façon de détecter et de prévenir ces activités illicites. ## Tirer les leçons des affaires de blanchiment d’argent Comprendre des scénarios du monde réel est l’un des moyens les plus efficaces de comprendre le processus complexe du blanchiment d’argent. Cette section examine de plus près certains des exemples de blanchiment d’argent les plus significatifs de l’histoire récente afin de fournir des informations précieuses sur la façon dont ces événements se sont déroulés et les leçons apprises. ### L’affaire Wachovia Bank En 2010, la Wachovia Bank a été impliquée dans une importante opération de blanchiment d’argent impliquant des cartels de la drogue mexicains. Entre 2004 et 2007, la banque a facilité le blanchiment de près de 390 milliards de dollars par l’intermédiaire de ses succursales. Les fonds illicites, glanés lors de la vente de drogue aux États-Unis, ont été passés en contrebande à travers la frontière mexicaine et ont ensuite été retournés sur les comptes américains de Wachovia. La banque n’a pas vérifié l’origine de ces fonds, manquant ainsi à ses obligations en matière de [connaissance du client (KYC).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/kyc-votre-bouclier-contre-les-crimes-financiers/) Au lieu de poursuites, Wachovia a payé une amende de 160 millions de dollars et s’est engagé à améliorer ses [procédures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AML).](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/donner-a-votre-organisation-les-moyens-dagir-batir-un-cadre-de-conformite-solide-en-matiere-de-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) ### L’affaire de la Standard Chartered Bank La Standard Chartered Bank s’est heurtée à de lourdes sanctions pour des violations répétées des sanctions américaines. Initialement condamnée à une amende de 670 millions de dollars en 2012 pour des violations impliquant l’Iran, la banque a de nouveau été accusée en 2019 d’ignorer les sanctions contre des pays tels que le Zimbabwe, la Birmanie, l’Iran, le Soudan, Cuba et la Syrie. Pour ces infractions, les autorités américaines et britanniques ont infligé à Standard Chartered une amende totale de 1,1 milliard de dollars, soulignant les graves conséquences du non-respect du droit international. ### L’affaire Danske Bank La succursale estonienne de Danske Bank a servi d’intermédiaire pour environ 228 milliards de dollars de fonds blanchis entre 2007 et 2015. Ce scandale, impliquant des milliers de clients suspects, a attiré l’attention du public sur les manquements de la banque en matière de conformité. Les autorités danoises ont infligé des amendes d’un montant total de 2 millions de dollars et ont attribué la faute à plusieurs responsables de la banque. ### L’affaire BCCI La Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) s’est livrée à des activités de fraude et de [blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) totalisant jusqu’à 23 milliards de dollars américains. La BCCI a utilisé des stratagèmes sophistiqués de blanchiment d’argent tels que [des sociétés écrans](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/a-linterieur-du-web-explorer-le-monde-sombre-des-societes-ecrans/), des paradis fiscaux, des commissions et des pots-de-vin. La fermeture de la banque en 1991 a donné lieu à de nombreuses actions en justice, notamment la poursuite de la Banque d’Angleterre par la BCCI pour négligence dans l’identification des signes avant-coureurs. Cette affaire met en évidence l’importance de solides programmes de conformité en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment [d’argent (Sanction Scanner](https://sanctionscanner.com/blog/the-five-biggest-money-laundering-scandals-317)). Ces exemples de blanchiment d’argent soulignent l’importance de procédures rigoureuses de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, d’une [diligence raisonnable](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/fr/le-devoir-de-vigilance-a-legard-de-la-clientele-votre-bouclier-contre-le-blanchiment-dargent/) approfondie à l’égard des clients et de la nécessité de comprendre les [étapes du blanchiment d’argent](https://financialcrimeacademy.org/stages-of-money-laundering/) pour détecter et dissuader la criminalité financière. En tirant les leçons de ces cas, les professionnels de la conformité et de la gestion des risques peuvent mieux préparer et protéger leurs organisations contre des situations similaires.

Avec l’un des dispositifs les plus robustes et efficaces au monde1, la France poursuit son engagement et s’applique à préserver l’intégrité de son système financier et renforcer l’efficacité de son arsenal de LCB-FT. L’évolution des méthodes de blanchiment de capitaux et de financement du terrorisme (BC-FT) utilisées par les criminels et l’émergence de nouveaux modes opératoires appellent une adaptation continue du cadre législatif et réglementaire. Retour sur un an de LCB-FT – une rétrospective en 3 volets : 1 - [Les nouvelles dispositions et orientations en matière de LCB-FT nées en 2024, au niveau européen et au niveau national](https://www.twobirds.com/fr/insights/2025/france/lcb-ft--retrospective-2024---partie-1) **2 -** **Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires** 3 - Les cryptoactifs, le nouveau hot-topic LCB-FT # Partie 2 : Un an de mise en œuvre des dispositions LCB-FT par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires ## 1. Les grands arrêts de la Cour de cassation en matière de blanchiment #### [Crim. 19 juin 2024, FS-B, n° 22-81.808](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000049533701?init=true&page=1&query=22-81.808&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) – Incidences du manquement d’une banque à ses obligations de vigilance en matière LCB-FT. C’est assurément l’arrêt de l’année en la matière – l’avenir dira s’il appartient aux grands arrêts qui ont les honneurs des ouvrages. Dans cet arrêt très commenté2 , la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions dans lesquelles un manquement aux obligations de vigilance imposées au titre de la législation anti-blanchiment était constitutif du délit de blanchiment au sens de l’article 324-1 du Code pénal. D’un côté, elle a pour la première fois expressément affirmé que le seul manquement d’une banque aux obligations de vigilance ne peut constituer un concours apporté à une opération de blanchiment du produit des infractions commises par son client. De l’autre, elle a justifié la condamnation de la banque dès lors qu’au regard des informations dont disposait cette dernière concernant le fonctionnement du compte litigieux, celle-ci ne pouvait ignorer l’origine frauduleuse des fonds y figurant. Dans ces conditions, la mise à disposition d’un compte bancaire dans l’un de ses établissements et l’exécution d’ordres de virement des sommes y figurant vers des comptes à l’étranger, qui sont eux des actes positifs, sont susceptibles de caractériser la participation de la banque à des opérations de blanchiment. Les commentateurs ne pourront certes y voir une responsabilité pour seul manquement aux obligations de vigilance mais les professionnels reconnaitront la finesse de la distinction opérée par la Cour. Celle-ci invite manifestement les établissements bancaires à la plus grande vigilance, dès lors que des fautes d’imprudence ou de négligence, des erreurs d’analyse ou des insuffisances de contrôles, associées à une absence de déclaration ou à une déclaration tardive, pourraient permettre de considérer qu’ils ont apporté, « en connaissance de cause », leur concours à des opérations de blanchiment. #### [Crim. 10 janvier 2024, n°](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) [22-85.721](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000048950014?init=true&page=1&query=22-85.721&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Portée limitée de la présomption d’illicéité des sommes objets du délit de blanchiment douanier. Dans cet arrêt, la Chambre criminelle a précisé les conditions pouvant conduire à une déclaration de culpabilité au titre d’un blanchiment douanier. Après avoir rappelé sa position selon laquelle le cumul des qualifications douanières et pénales pour un même fait ne porte pas atteinte au principe *non bis in idem*, la Cour a censuré la décision insuffisamment motivée des juges du fond qui s’étaient bornés, pour faire application de la présomption posée par l’article 415-1 du Code des douanes, à relever la seule impossibilité de justifier de l’origine et de la licéité des fonds. Il incombait en effet aux juges du fond non seulement de rechercher si les conditions matérielles, juridiques ou financières de l’opération d’exportation, d’importation, de transfert ou de compensation ne paraissaient obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler l’origine illicite des fonds, mais également de rechercher si elles ne paraissaient pas obéir à d’autre motif que de dissimuler qu’ils étaient le produit d’une des trois catégories3. Le transport sans déclaration ne suffit donc pas à caractériser le produit illicite à l’origine du blanchiment. #### [Crim. 13 mars 2024, n° 22-83.689](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000051553772?init=true&page=1&query=22-83.689&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all), FS-B - Caractérisation de la circonstance aggravante d’habitude en matière de blanchiment. Dans cet arrêt, la chambre criminelle a apporté d’utiles précisions sur la circonstance aggravante d’habitude liée à la commission du blanchiment. Pour la première fois, elle affirmé que la circonstance d’habitude, énoncée à l’article 324-2, 1° du Code pénal, ne s’attache pas au blanchiment mais résulte de la multiplication des opérations de conversion et de dissimulation du produit de l’infraction d’origine, et ce peu important que les fonds blanchis proviennent d’un unique délit4 . Le caractère habituel s’attache ainsi non pas au à l’infraction d’origine mais aux éléments matériels du blanchiment. #### [Crim., 16 octobre 2024, n° 23-82.720](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050384866?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.720&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment. La preuve de l’élément moral de l’infraction de blanchiment a été abordé dans un arrêt d’octobre 2024. Si les juges du fond peuvent déduire la connaissance par l’agent de l’origine criminelle ou délictuelle de l’opération de blanchiment des circonstances de fait entourant l’acte ou de sa qualité de professionnel, les éléments pris en considération doivent être suffisamment certains. Doit ainsi être censuré l’arrêt qui se fonde sur le motif hypothétique selon lequel *« il parait difficilement concevable qu’en tant que gérante, la prévenue ne se soit pas aperçue des encaissements importantes qui prévalaient sur ses comptes, et des flux financiers qui en découlaient alors qu’elle-même a perçu des sommes en contrepartie des opérations qu’elle effectuait »* pour considérer que celle-ci avait connaissance de l’origine des fonds versés sur son compte bancaire et avait eu l’intention de les dissimuler. On ne peut que saluer ce rappel à la nécessaire rigueur dans l’appréciation des comportements de blanchiment et de l’élément intentionnel, souvent trop vite balayé. #### [Crim. 4 septembre 2024, n° 22-87.061](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050192590?init=true&page=1&query=+22-87.061+&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) et [Crim. 18 septembre 2024, n° 23-82.477](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000050290543?init=true&page=1&query=23-82.477&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all) - Rappels en matière de prescription Aux termes de deux arrêts plus confidentiels, la Cour a également a fait quelques rappels utiles en matière de prescription et des délais spécifiques en matière d’infraction occulte ou dissimulée. D’une part, lorsque le délit est occulte ou dissimulé, le point de la prescription doit être reporté à la date de la dénonciation des faits au ministère public ayant permis la révélation du délit. Tel est notamment le cas lorsque les transferts de fonds provenant de délits de blanchiment d’abus de confiance et d’abus de biens sociaux vers des comptes étrangers ont été entrepris selon des modalités destinées à dissimuler tant l’existence des investissements à l’étranger que les revenus générés, notamment à l’aide d’une comptabilité irrégulière et d’opérations financières ou comptables complexes faisant obstacle à tout traçabilité5 . D’autre part, elle précise que l’opération de blanchiment doit s’entendre non seulement de l’opération de placement initial des fonds sur un compte occulte mais également des opérations de réemploi de ces fonds, le tout constituant des opérations de dissimulation, placement et conversion ; de telle sorte que c’est la dernière de ces opérations qui doit être retenue dans la détermination du point de départ du délai de prescription6. ## 2. Répression judiciaire et réglementaire du blanchiment : les affaires qui ont marqué 2024 Les acteurs du monde bancaire et financier, premiers exposés au risque de poursuites et de sanction en matière LCB-FT, n’ont évidemment pas été épargnés par les autorités judiciaires et réglementaires, qui ont prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions qui ont attiré notre attention, en France évidemment, mais également à l’étranger. ### 2.1 En France Après une année 2023 marquée par la confirmation de la sanction du géant UBS, 2024 marque la troisième année consécutive qu’une convention judiciaire d’intérêt public (CJIP) est conclue en matière de blanchiment, impliquant un établissement bancaire. Une CJIP a en effet été conclue le 27 août 2024 entre le procureur de la République financier et la société **Danske Bank A/S**, puis validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris le 18 septembre 20247 . Une information judiciaire, ouverte en avril 2015, avait mis en évidence des flux financiers constitutifs de fraude fiscale commis par la gérante de la société Decobat, lesquels transitaient par des comptes ouverts en Estonie, dans des livres de la succursale estonienne de la Danske Bank, la Sampo Bank. La gérante de Decobat avait été condamnée en janvier 2024, par comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité (CRPC), des infractions de fraude fiscale et blanchiment de fraude fiscale. Danske Bank A/S avait quant à elle été mise en examen en février 2019 du chef de blanchiment de fraude fiscale en bande organisée. Il lui était en substance reproché d’avoir ouvert des comptes de passage fictifs destinés à recevoir de l’argent provenant de fraudes fiscales en bande organisée et d’avoir permis que ces comptes soient débités de multiples opérations dépourvues de justification économique, de sorte que ces opérations n’avaient d’autres but que de masquer la destination des fonds détournés et d’en faire bénéficier les destinataires à l’étranger. Le montant de l’amende d’intérêt public (6 028 799 euros) a été validé, notamment *« eu égard à la coopération active de la société, aux mesures correctrices engagées, et à la pertinence des investigations internes menées dans le cadre des poursuites engagées par les régulateurs danois et américains »*. L’intérêt des autorités de poursuites pour les acteurs institutionnels du secteur bancaire et financier a été confirmé par un de ses principaux acteurs : lors d’une récente conférence tenue à l’initiative du Directeur Général des Douanes et des droits indirects, le Procureur de la République Financier a rappelé que *« près 30 % des procédures du PNF visent l’infraction de blanchiment »*, soit au dernier comptage de la synthèse annuelle 2024, près de 230 procédures en cours8 . Ce n’est pas tout : l’autorité judiciaire est par ailleurs concurrencée par les autorités de sanction des régulateurs sectoriels, également très actives en 2024. La commission des sanctions de l’**ACPR** a ainsi rendu trois décisions dans le secteur bancaire, dont deux portant sur des manquements liés à la LCB-FT. La première concerne l’établissement de monnaie électronique **Treezor**, qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un million d’euros pour divers manquements très sérieux, qui affectaient gravement plusieurs éléments fondamentaux du dispositif de LCB-FT9. En particulier, il était reproché à la société de ne pas avoir déterminé, au moment du contrôle, un profil de risque de ses relations d’affaires lui permettant de respecter son obligation de vigilance constante. Son dispositif de surveillance des opérations était par ailleurs, sur de nombreux points, insuffisant. En plus d’une carence de son dispositif à l’origine de déclarations de soupçon tardives, des défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclarations de soupçon ont été relevés par la Commission. La fixation de la sanction pécuniaire a cependant tenu compte, dans le respect du principe de proportionnalité, des importantes actions de remédiation entreprises par Treezor et de sa situation financière. La seconde décision a été prononcée à l’encontre de la Banque régionale d’escompte et de dépôt (**BRED**), qui s’est vu infliger un blme et une sanction pécuniaire d’un montant de 2,5 millions d’euros à raison, outre plusieurs défauts d’examen renforcé et de déclaration de soupçon, de défaillances significatives dans son dispositif de surveillance des opérations. En l’occurrence, celles-ci étaient de nature à affecter sa capacité à identifier et traiter efficacement les opérations atypiques (exclusion de certains comptes du champ du dispositif automatisé de surveillance, paramétrage inapproprié de certains scénarios, informations incomplètes sur le revenu ou le chiffre d’affaires dans la base clients, motivation insuffisante du classement sans suite des alertes, notamment)10. La Commission des sanctions de l’**AMF** a également prononcé plusieurs sanctions en lien avec des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT. Dès janvier 2024, des sanctions pécuniaires ont été infligées à la société **SPI** (20 000 euros) et à son ancien dirigeant (10 0000 euros)11. Était notamment fait grief à la SPI de ne pas avoir disposé d’une procédure LCB-FT opérationnelle (les documents remis par elle à la mission de contrôle étant de simples modèles vierges établis par l’association professionnelle à laquelle elle adhère, lesquels ne peuvent être considérés comme une procédure LCB-FT et, *a fortiori*, opérationnelle) et de ne pas avoir mentionné le niveau de risque du client correspondant à la classification établie par la cartographie figurant dans ce dispositif. Au mois de juin, un blme et une sanction pécuniaire de 10 000 euros ont été prononcées à l’encontre de la société **Activ Finance Conseils**12. Parmi les griefs invoqués, il lui était reproché de ne pas avoir respecté ses obligations en matière de LCB-FT (notamment en ne collectant pas l’intégralité des cartographies des risques et des autres documents par la procédure de LCB-FT qu’elle avait adoptée). L’ensemble des manquements commis par la société ont été imputés à la dirigeant de l’époque, à l’encontre de laquelle un blme a également été prononcé. Un mois plus tard, un avertissement a été prononcé à l’encontre de la société de gestion de portefeuille **Inter Gestion REIM** et de ses dirigeants13. Des sanctions de 300 000 et 15 000 euros ont également été respectivement prononcées à leur égard. En l’occurrence, la société avait manqué à toute une série d’obligations, dont celle d’établir un dispositif LCB-FT adéquat et opérationnel puis d’en assurer l’effectivité (étaient notamment relevés : le caractère lacunaire des diligences effectuées au passif et à l’actif des fonds, l’absence de modalités d’échange automatique d’informations avec l’administration fiscale, ou encore l’absence de formation régulière du personnel). Le 12 septembre 2024, la Commission des Sanction de l’AMF a sanctionné la société de gestion de portefeuille **Sogenial Immobilier** et son président, et prononcé à leur encontre des sanctions pécuniaires d’un montant respectif de 150 000 euros et de 30 000 euros14. La société n’avait, entre autres, pas réalisé toutes les diligences de LCB-FT, ni lors d’investissements réalisés pour le compte des fonds gérés, ni à l’égard de clients ayant souscrit dans une SCPI, et n’avait pas mis en œuvre sa procédure LCB-FT. ### 2.2 À l’étranger Si la France est particulièrement active sur le plan judiciaire et réglementaire dans la lutte contre le blanchiment et la prévention des risques associés, d’autres pays se sont également illustrés cette année, par l’importance, aux plans théorique ou pécuniaire, des sanctions prononcées contre des acteurs du secteur financier. À **Monaco**, quelques mois après l’ajout de la principauté sur la « liste grise » de surveillance renforcée du GAFI, deux anciens banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende de 10 000 euros et à des peines d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir participé dans le blanchiment de millions d’euros déposés en espèces par deux hommes d’affaires italiens. Dans une affaire connexe de l’affaire, trois autres banquiers ont été condamnés à une amende comprise entre 5000 et 7000 euros pour non-déclaration de dépôts en espèces suspects. En **Suisse**, le procès en appel lié à la « Bulgarian Connection » s’était ouvert en automne devant le Tribunal pénal fédéral. La Cour d’appel a finalement acquitté la banque **UBS** – qui avait hérité de cette affaire après l’absorption du Crédit Suisse plus tôt dans l’année – du chef de blanchiment d’argent aggravé. Elle a néanmoins confirmé partiellement les condamnations de deux coprévenus pour leurs activités en lien avec une organisation criminelle bulgare active dans le trafic de stupéfiants et le blanchiment d’argent15. A l’instar de la France, la **Suisse** et les différents membres de l’Union Européenne disposent, à côté des autorités de poursuites judiciaires, de puissants régulateurs du secteur bancaire et financier dont le niveau d’implication dans la poursuite des manquements aux obligations LCB-FT est en constante augmentation, à l’image des sanctions pécuniaires qu’elles imposent. Ainsi, en Suisse, au terme d’une procédure d’*enforcement*, l’Autorité fédérale de surveillance des marchés financiers (FINMA), a prononcé une confiscation de 12,7 millions de francs suisses *« indûment obtenus »* à l’encontre de la banque privée **Mirabaud & Cie SA** pour avoir manqué à ses obligations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et avoir gravement enfreint les règles du droit des marchés financiers. Elle a notamment considéré que la banque n’avait pas suffisamment vérifié et documenté les ayants droit économiques de nombreuses transactions, alors même qu’il existait des indices de risques accrus de blanchiment d’argent et que des signaux d’alertes concernant ces relations d’affaires avaient été émis16 . L’équivalent de la FINMA en **Allemagne**, l’Autorité Fédérale de Supervision Financière (BaFin) a sanctionné la banque **N26 Bank AG** à une amende de 9,2 millions d’euros pour des insuffisances lors de déclarations de soupçons en 2022. Sont notamment reprochés à la banque en ligne des retards systématiques dans la transmission des soupçons de blanchiment d’argent. Cette amende s’ajoute à celle de 4,25 millions d’euros, prononcée en 2021 pour des failles dans son dispositif de prévention du blanchiment. En **Suède**, **Klarna** a été sanctionnée à une amende de 500 millions de couronnes suédoises (près de 45 millions d’euros) par l’autorité de surveillance financière suédoise *(Finansinspektionen)* pour divers manquements. Lui sont reprochées d’importantes lacunes dans l’évaluation générale des risques ainsi que l’absence de procédures et de lignes directrices permettant d’identifier les situations dans lesquelles des mesures de diligence raisonnable devaient être prises pour les clients utilisant leur produit de facturation. L’année 2024 aura également été productive pour la *Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)* britannique, qui a infligé de lourdes amendes pour des manquements à la législation sur le blanchiment d’argent : 16,7 millions de livres sterling (19,2 millions d’euros) à **Metro Bank** pour manquement aux contrôles de lutte contre le blanchiment et défaut de surveillance des transactions ; 3,5 millions de livres sterling (4,1 millions d’euros) à la plateforme de cryptomonnaies **Coinbase** pour des lacunes dans la conception et le suivi des procédures de vérification des clients ; et près de 29 millions de livres sterling (35 millions d’euros) à la banque Starling pour *« laxisme choquant »* dans ses contrôles anti-blanchiment. Si on ignore encore quelle sera la magnitude des dernières lubies du Président américain en matière de lutte contre les infractions économiques et financières (et notamment la « pause » forcée du *Foreign Corrupt Practice Act* (FCPA) annoncée aux premières lueurs de l’année 2025), on se souviendra qu’avant le cataclysme, le DOJ prenait sa part dans l’effort mené par les autorités judiciaires et de régulation dans la lutte contre le blanchiment. La banque canadienne Toronto-Dominion Bank (**TD Bank**) a ainsi accepté de plaider coupable aux Etats-Unis pour une infraction à la législation américaine en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment. Il lui était reproché d’avoir permis à trois réseaux de blanchir plus de 670 millions de dollars et d’avoir manqué à ses obligations de contrôle de des transactions pendant près de 10 ans. La banque doit désormais s’acquitter d’une pénalité de 3 milliards de dollars et modifier ses procédures internes17. \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ [1] [Plan d\\'action pour lutter contre le blanchiment de capitaux, le financement du terrorisme et de la prolifération d\\'armes de destruction massive (2021-2022)](https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=CBFBD522-0731-4DBE-919B-3B8E1340F2D1&filename=811%20-%20Plan%20d%27action%20pour%20lutter%20contre%20le%20blanchiment%20de%20capitaux%2C%20le%20financement%20du%20terrorisme%20et%20de%20la%20prolif%C3%A9ration%202021-2022.pdf).

The settlement followed a judicial investigation opened in April 2015 that uncovered financial flows constituting tax fraud committed by the manager of Decobat, with funds transiting through accounts in Estonia held at Danske Bank's Estonian branch, Sampo Bank. The manager of Decobat was convicted in January 2024 for tax fraud and laundering of tax fraud. Danske Bank A/S was indicted in February 2019 for laundering of organized tax fraud, accused of opening fictitious transit accounts to receive money from organized tax fraud and allowing these accounts to be debited through multiple unjustified transactions to conceal the destination of misappropriated funds and benefit foreign recipients.

Les blanchisseurs, pas de frontières. Ces derniers profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance et des législations européennes pour passer entre les mailles du filet. Avec la création, cet été, de l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (Anti-Money Laundering Authority ou AMLA), l’Union européenne peut-elle centraliser la lutte contre la finance illicite?** * * * L’inclusion probable et imminente de Monaco, symbole mondial de richesse et de discrétion, dans la [liste des pays à haut risque en matière de blanchiment d’argent](https://www.touteleurope.eu/economie-et-social/blanchiment-d-argent-quels-pays-sont-consideres-a-risque-par-la-commission-europeenne/) établie par l’Union européenne (UE), a suscité de nombreuses réactions. L’ajout potentiel de la principauté sur la liste noire met en évidence le défi que représente la lutte contre la finance illicite. Dans une zone comme l’UE, l’ouverture des frontières contraste avec la mise en œuvre et la surveillance des mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ([l’AML –Anti-Money Laundering](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en?prefLang=fr)). Des politiques qui restent largement confinées à la responsabilité des différents pays membres. Une [transaction financière](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52022SC0344&utm_) peut commencer dans un pays à haut risque, passer par une banque européenne et se terminer par une transaction immobilière à Londres ou un trust suisse. C’est précisément pour cette raison que la coordination internationale est si importante. Sans elle, les blanchisseurs d’argent profitent de la fragmentation de la surveillance, en particulier au sein de l’UE. Avec l’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent , ou Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA), qui entre en fonction cet été, l’Union européenne opte pour la [centralisation](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jfc-03-2023-0059/full/pdf). Les politiques européennes et françaises de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ont échoué [pour plusieurs raisons](https://op.europa.eu/fr/publication-detail/-/publication/03f702aa-03bb-11ec-8f47-01aa75ed71a1/language-fr): une application inégale des réglementations, un manque de ressources et de coopération internationale, des sanctions peu dissuasives face à des techniques toujours plus sophistiquées et un phénomène global difficile à cerner. Pour progresser, il faut renforcer l’harmonisation des règles, augmenter les moyens des autorités, adopter des technologies avancées et améliorer la transparence des structures. Des objectifs que l’AMLA a précisément [vocation à concrétiser](https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en). Cent milliards d’euros par an ----------------------------- Quelques rares et prudentes estimations confirment que les flux financiers illicites traversent trop facilement les frontières et que leurs montants sont colossaux. Selon les estimations de l’Office des Nations unies contre la drogue et le crime (ONUDC), le [blanchiment d’argent représenterait de 2% à 5% du PIB mondial, soit de 800 milliards à 2 000 milliards de dollars américains](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) actuels. Dans l’Union européenne, le produit des activités criminelles est [estimé à plus de 100 milliards d’euros par an](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/criminal_asset_recovery_in_the_eu_web_version_0.pdf), dont seul un pourcentage négligeable est finalement saisi. [Des recherches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75653-x) estiment que l’argent provenant du trafic de drogue, du trafic des personnes et du terrorisme passe souvent par des banques de 4 à 6 pays différents avant d’être blanchi et d’entrer dans l’économie légale. * * * ![Image 7](https://images.theconversation.com/files/652674/original/file-20250303-32-etg46y.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip) _Du lundi au vendredi + le dimanche, recevez gratuitement les analyses et décryptages de nos experts pour un autre regard sur l’actualité.

La [Danske Bank](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180924-danemark-estonie-danske-bank-scandale-oligarque) est devenue l’épicentre du plus grand scandale de blanchiment d’argent en Europe. Il a été révélé que plus de 200 milliards d’euros de transactions suspectes ont transité par sa succursale estonienne. La [Deutsche Bank](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/banque-assurances/des-centaines-de-milliards-de-dollars-dargent-sale-blanchis-par-de-grandes-banques-1244280) a fait l’objet de multiples enquêtes pour avoir facilité des transferts illicites de plusieurs milliards d’euros, notamment par le biais de sa collaboration avec Danske et de ses liens avec le système _Russian Laundromat_. [ING](https://trends.levif.be/a-la-une/banque/ing-a-verse-775-millions-deuros-pour-regler-une-affaire-de-blanchiment/) a payé une amende de 775 millions d’euros aux autorités néerlandaises pour des violations de la législation anti-blanchiment en 2018. Tracfin en France ----------------- Les pays de l’Union européenne mettent en œuvre les directives européennes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, avec des niveaux d’ambition variables. La France a montré un [engagement ferme](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin/la-qualite-du-dispositif-francais-de-lbc-ft-reconnue-par-le-gafi) dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent grâce à l’approche de sa cellule de renseignement financier, [Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins (Tracfin)](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin). Elle a récemment renforcé son analyse des [transactions suspectes](https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/4153148-20250513-tracfin-recu-nombre-record-declarations-soupcon-2024), élargi sa coopération avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux et amélioré son utilisation des analyses de données avancées pour détecter les flux illicites complexes. Malgré ces progrès, certaines affaires récentes, comme les failles des [néobanques](https://theconversation.com/qonto-monabanq-hellobank-lascension-des-neobanques-ira-t-elle-trop-loin-242541) ou l’enquête visant BNP Paribas pour blanchiment via [Chypre](https://decouverte.challenges.fr/economie/france-bnp-paribas-pris-dans-une-enquete-pour-blanchiment-aggrave-liee-a-chypre_878359), montrent que des flux illicites échappent encore à la détection de Tracfin. Dissuader les défaillances des contrôles bancaires internes ----------------------------------------------------------- Malgré son poids économique, l’Allemagne a été [critiquée](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/cash-hungry-germany-criticised-by-watchdog-over-money-laundering) pour son implication insuffisante, ainsi que pour les défaillances de sa surveillance. La mise en œuvre de sa politique varie d’un Land à l’autre; les difficultés rencontrées en matière de coopération internationale, en particulier avant l’effondrement de la société spécialisée dans le paiement électronique Wirecard, n’aident pas. En revanche, les autorités néerlandaises ont suivi l’exemple des États-Unis. Ils ont infligé des amendes importantes à des établissements tels que [ING](https://www.prosecutionservice.nl/latest/news/2018/09/04/ing-pays-775-million-due-to-serious-shortcomings-in-money-laundering-prevention) et [ABN AMRO](https://apnews.com/article/business-netherlands-money-laundering-b7c07284946e1561c1f2231de30dcfef), démontrant ainsi leur ferme volonté de lutter contre la criminalité financière en dissuadant les défaillances des contrôles internes dans les banques. * * * _**Read more: [Credit Suisse: les leçons d’une lente descente aux enfers](https://theconversation.com/credit-suisse-les-lecons-dune-lente-descente-aux-enfers-202363)**_ * * * Ces approches inégales de la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent dans les États membres de l’UE s’expliquent par [plusieurs facteurs](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0170_EN.html). Les différentes interprétations des règles en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent créent des lacunes dans la couverture juridique. Une coopération judiciaire transfrontalière irrégulière, en particulier avec les pays tiers, entrave l’efficacité de l’application de la législation. En outre, les cellules de renseignement financier ont des pouvoirs et des responsabilités très variables. L’absence de format standardisé pour les déclarations d’opérations suspectes complique l’intégration des données dans la plate-forme centrale de l’Union européenne. Elle rend la coordination des actions plus difficile qu’elle ne devrait l’être. Mais tout cela est sur le point de changer… Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent (AMLA) ------------------------------------------------------------------ Pour remédier à ces faiblesses, l’Union européenne est en train de créer l’[Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/753212c5-166b-48ae-a44f-ffbb09a1eede/files/3de11274-cba7-414d-b0dd-6fbfcabf4d10), ou _Anti-Money Laundering Authority_ (AMLA). Elle devrait être pleinement opérationnelle à partir de 2028. Basée à Francfort, l’AMLA supervisera directement une quarantaine d’établissements financiers transfrontaliers à haut risque, harmonisera l’application des règles dans les États membres et coordonnera les régulateurs nationaux. Elle aura le pouvoir de mener des inspections sur place, d’imposer des sanctions et de renforcer le cadre global de l’UE en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. ![Image 8](https://images.theconversation.com/files/678599/original/file-20250707-56-wmpqc5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip) L’Autorité européenne de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent, créée en 2024 par l’Union européenne, est chargée de la traque des flux financiers suspects.[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stuttgart-germany-03102025-person-holding-cellphone-2604415937) Afin de soutenir le rôle de l’AMLA, l’UE introduit un règlement unique qui remplacera les différentes législations nationales par un ensemble de normes unifiées dans tous les États membres. Avec l’AMLA, Bruxelles parie que la centralisation peut réussir là où la décentralisation a échoué. La décentralisation signifie que chaque État membre appliquait les règles anti-blanchiment à sa manière, en transposant les directives européennes dans son droit national. Cela a conduit à des normes [contradictoires](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12027-024-00805-9). Par exemple, certains pays imposaient des seuils de déclaration différents ou avaient des définitions divergentes des entités à surveiller, rendant la coopération inefficace et les contrôles inégaux. Avertissement symbolique ------------------------ L’AMLA pourrait se heurter à des difficultés. La complexité des différences juridiques et institutionnelles entre les États membres, la mobilisation de nombreuses expertises pour superviser un large éventail de secteurs, pourrait rendre ce travail fastidieux. La nécessité de trouver un équilibre entre les préoccupations en matière de souveraineté nationale et la nécessité d’une application efficace et unifiée dans toute l’UE également. Alors que l’Union européenne se prépare à lancer l’AMLA, l’inclusion de pays comme Monaco sur sa liste noire est un avertissement symbolique. Désormais, aucune juridiction, aussi riche ou prestigieuse soit-elle, n’est à l’abri d’un examen minutieux. Le devenir de l’AMLA comme véritable autorité de contrôle puissante dépendra de trois piliers: la volonté politique, la solidité de sa conception institutionnelle et l’ampleur des moyens humains et techniques qui lui seront alloués. Sans volonté politique, l’AMLA risque d’être affaiblie par les intérêts nationaux. Sans conception institutionnelle solide, ses compétences pourraient se heurter à des obstacles juridiques et bureaucratiques.

It is estimated that 2- 5% of the global GDP or US$800 billion-US$2 trillion is being laundered every year across the globe. The lower range itself is a significant amount for the world to consider. For comparison, Saudi Arabia’s estimated nominal GDP is US$748 billion in 2018, ranking the country at 19 in the world. In order to combat money laundering, governments have formulated and implemented policies, and they have been successful in identifying more and more laundering activities and subsequently taking remedial measures. Here is an attempt to portray some of the biggest money laundering cases by the estimated size of money being laundered in recent times. The figures have been converted into US dollars in some cases for easier comparison. ## Commerzbank (US$347 million) The London branch of Commerzbank is the subject of one of the most severe fines in the UK. Commerzbank was facing a $50 million fine in June 2020. This German banking firm ignored several warnings from the cautious regulator and failed to adopt necessary know-your-customer laws affecting thousands of the bank’s customers. In 2016 and 2017, the bank failed to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-kickback laws. Due to a shortage of staff in the anti-money laundering department, Commerzbank employed 47 additional employees, bringing the total number of AML professionals in the department to 50. This helped the bank avoid future fines. Despite this, the bank failed to accommodate and offer necessary anti-money laundering (AML) protections. ## Westpac Bank (US$11 billion) With 19 million global transactions, this Australian financial service resolved with AUSTRAC in 2020 for AML concerns. They ended up paying one of the largest fines in history as a result of their efforts to avoid the regulations. Westpac skirted around several provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Act of 2006. The banks’ ignorance of the law resulted in the penalties, which are believed to be worth over $11 billion. The banks’ ignorance was linked to offshore paedophile rings in Southeast Asia, prompting harsh reprimands. Because many of the transactions were linked to the network, the authorities investigated the settlement, which resulted in a $1.3 billion fine. ## Goldman Sachs (US$600 million) The world-famous Goldman Sachs was hit with the greatest fine in 2020. In the business’s 151-year history, the biggest fine ever issued in the US represented the first time the company had ever pleaded guilty to any financial violation. The Malaysian unit of Goldman Sachs was involved in the [1MBD scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/1mdb-scandal-explained-a-tale-of-malaysias-missing-billions), which had been in the works for more than ten years. [Bribery](/glossary/bribery), money laundering, and gross misuse of consumer funds were all committed by the company. After agreeing to pay a $2.5 billion fine, an additional $1.4 billion was fined in order to avoid prosecution by paying out 1MBD assets. ## Wachovia (US$390 billion) Now part of Wells Fargo, Wachovia was one of the biggest banks in the US. In 2010, the bank was found to have allowed drug cartels in Mexico to launder close to US$390 billion through its branches during 2004-2007. The drug cartels used to smuggle US dollars received from drug sales in the US across the Mexican border. Then, they used money exchangers to deposit the money into their bank accounts in Mexico, where regulatory requirements with regard to the source of funds were not on par with current standards. Later, the money was wired back to Wachovia’s accounts in the US, and the bank failed to check the origin of these funds. In addition, the drug cartels used Wachovia’s bulk cash service to ship back banknotes to the US. ## Standard Chartered (US$265 billion) The British banking giant in 2012 was accused by New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) of its failures in anti-money laundering controls that helped the Iranian government to circumvent US regulations to clean money to the tune of US$265 billion over a period of 10 years. In addition, the bank was accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Libya and Sudan. ## Danske Bank (US$228 billion) Denmark’s largest bank came into the limelight after the European Commission described its US$228 billion money laundering case as the biggest scandal in Europe. The bank’s Estonian branch allegedly had thousands of suspicious customers who made use of the bank’s weak controls to carry out illicit transactions worth about US$228 billion during 2007-2015. ## Nauru (US$70 billion) Nauru, once known for its tax-haven status with a large number of shell banks, helped Russian criminals launder an estimated US$70 billion in 1998. At that time, the island country in Micronesia, northeast of Australia, was allegedly allowing its banks to operate without properly identifying its customers and checking the source of deposits. ## BCCI (US$23 billion) From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and its customers were found to have committed fraud and money laundering activities totaling US$23 billion. BCCI was formed up purposefully to circumvent centralised regulatory supervision, according to investigators in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. To avoid regulatory inspection, the bank allegedly used a variety of complicated strategies, including shell firms, secrecy havens, kickbacks, and bribery. ## HSBC ($8 billion) In 2012, the bank was fined for having insufficient control measures, which permitted the laundering of an estimated $8 billion over a seven-year period. Provision of banking services and US dollars to some Saudi Arabian banks with apparent ties to terrorists, circumventing international sanctions and allowing transactions involving blacklisted countries such as Iran and North Korea. It also included improper controls at HSBC Mexico despite its apparent drug trafficking and money laundering problem was among the complaints levelled against the bank. For failing to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or know-your-customer regulations, all of the above-mentioned enterprises and financial institutions faced harsh penalties. Some of these financial institutions unwittingly participated in serious criminal behaviour and crimes by failing to pay attention to the protocols or deciding not to follow them. Other institutions can prevent these blunders by comprehending and implementing the established standards, ensuring that money laundering is not unintentionally carried out. Thus, they can avoid being part in money laundering cases. Advances in technology, particularly in financial services, have made it possible for criminals to move money around the world with ease. Launderers have been spotted devising complex ways to go beyond a government’s remedies. Banks have started realising the fact that their legacy rule-based systems cannot effectively mitigate risks related to money laundering. Now, they need to embrace advanced technology that can effectively solve their problems of getting involved in money laundering cases. Financial institutions can effectively make use of solutions based on machine learning, such as [Tookitaki’s AML Suite](/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), to counter money laundering cases.

A senior citizen in Navi Mumbai answered a number that appeared to belong to the police. Within hours, she was trapped on a video call with men in uniforms, accused of laundering money for terrorists. Terrified, she wired ₹21 lakh into what she believed was a government-controlled account. She was not alone. In August 2025, cases of “digital arrest” scams surged across India. An elderly couple in Madhya Pradesh drained nearly ₹50 lakh of their life savings after spending 13 days under constant video surveillance by fraudsters posing as investigators. In Rajkot, criminals used the pretext of a real anti-terror operation to extort money from a student. These scams are not crude phishing attempts. They are meticulously staged psychological operations, exploiting people’s deepest fears of authority and social disgrace. Victims are not tricked into handing over passwords. They are coerced, minute by minute, into making transfers themselves. The results are devastating, both for individuals and the wider financial system. ## Background of the Scam The anatomy of a digital arrest scam follows a chillingly consistent script. **1. The Call of Fear** Fraudsters begin with a phone call, often masked to resemble an official number. The caller claims the victim’s details have surfaced in a serious crime: drug trafficking, terror financing, or money laundering. The consequences are presented as immediate arrest, frozen accounts, or ruined reputations. **2. Escalation to Video** To heighten credibility, the fraudster insists on switching to a video call. Victims are connected to people wearing uniforms, holding forged identity cards, or even sitting before backdrops resembling police stations and courtrooms. **3. Isolation and Control** Once on video, the victim is told they cannot disconnect. In some cases, they are monitored round the clock, ordered not to use their phone for any purpose other than the call. Contact with family or friends is prohibited, under the guise of “confidential investigations.” **4. The Transfer of Funds** The victim is then directed to transfer money into so-called “secure accounts” to prove their innocence or pay bail. These accounts are controlled by criminals and serve as the first layer in complex laundering networks. Victims, believing they are cooperating with the law, empty fixed deposits, break retirement savings, and transfer sums that can take a lifetime to earn. The method blends social engineering with coercive control. It is not the theft of data, but the hijacking of human behaviour. ## What the Case Revealed The 2025 wave of digital arrest scams in India exposed three critical truths about modern fraud. **1. Video Calls Are No Longer a Guarantee of Authenticity** For years, people considered video more secure than phone calls or emails. If you could see someone’s face, the assumption was that they were genuine. These scams demolished that trust. Fraudsters showed that live video, like written messages, can be staged, manipulated, and weaponised. **2. Authority Bias is a Fraudster’s Greatest Weapon** Humans are hardwired to respect authority, especially law enforcement. By impersonating police or investigators, criminals bypass the victim’s critical reasoning. Fear of prison or social disgrace outweighs logical checks. **3. Coercion Multiplies the Damage** Unlike [phishing](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/phishing) or one-time deceptions, digital arrests involve prolonged psychological manipulation. Victims are kept online for days, bombarded with threats and false evidence. Under this pressure, even cautious individuals break down. The results are not minor losses, but catastrophic financial wipe-outs. **4. Organised Networks Are Behind the Scenes** The professionalism and scale suggest syndicates, not lone operators. From forged documents to layered mule accounts, the fraud points to criminal hubs capable of running scripted operations across borders. ## Impact on Financial Institutions and Corporates Though victims are individuals, the implications extend far into the financial and corporate world. **1. Reputational Risk** When victims lose life savings through accounts within the banking system, they often blame their bank as much as the fraudster. Even if technically blameless, institutions suffer a hit to public trust. **2. Pressure on Fraud Systems** Digital arrest scams exploit authorised transactions. Victims themselves make the transfers. Traditional detection tools that focus on unauthorised access or password breaches cannot easily flag these cases. **3. Global Movement of Funds** Money from scams rarely stays local. Transfers are routed across borders within hours, layered through mule accounts, e-wallets, and fintech platforms. This complicates recovery and exposes gaps in international coordination. **4. Corporate Vulnerability** The threat is not limited to retirees or individuals. In Singapore earlier this year, a finance director was tricked into wiring half a million dollars during a deepfake board call. Digital arrest tactics could just as easily target corporate employees handling high-value transactions. **5. Regulatory Expectations** As scams multiply, regulators are pressing institutions to demonstrate stronger customer protections, more resilient monitoring, and greater collaboration. Failure to act risks not only reputational damage but also regulatory penalties. ## Lessons Learned from the Scam **For Individuals** * Treat unsolicited calls from law enforcement with suspicion. Real investigations do not begin on the phone. * Verify independently by calling the published numbers of agencies. * Watch for signs of manipulation, such as demands for secrecy or threats of immediate arrest. * Educate vulnerable groups, particularly senior citizens, about how these scams operate. **For Corporates** * Train employees, especially those in finance roles, to recognise coercion tactics. * Require secondary verification for urgent, high-value transfers, especially when directed to new accounts. * Encourage a speak-up culture where staff can challenge suspicious instructions without fear of reprimand. **For Financial Institutions** * Monitor for mule account activity. Unexplained inflows followed by rapid withdrawals are a red flag. * Run customer awareness campaigns, explaining how digital arrest scams work. * Share intelligence with peers and regulators to prevent repeat incidents across institutions. ## The Role of Technology in Prevention Digital arrest scams prove that traditional safeguards are insufficient. Fraudsters are not stealing credentials but manipulating behaviour. Prevention requires smarter, adaptive systems. **1. Behavioural Monitoring** Transactions made under duress often differ from normal patterns. Advanced analytics can detect anomalies, such as sudden large transfers from accounts with low historical activity. **2. Typology-Driven Detection** Platforms like Tookitaki’s [FinCense](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) leverage the [AFC Ecosystem](https://www.afcecosystem.org) to encode real-world scam scenarios into detection logic. As digital arrest typologies are identified, they can be integrated quickly to improve monitoring. **3. AI-Powered Simulations** Institutions can run simulations of coercion-based scams to test whether their processes would withstand them. These exercises reveal gaps in escalation and verification controls. **4. Federated Learning for Collective Defence** With federated learning, insights from one bank can be shared across many without exposing sensitive data. If one institution sees a pattern in digital arrest cases, others can benefit almost instantly. **5. Smarter Alert Management** Agentic AI can review and narrate the context of alerts, allowing investigators to understand whether unusual activity stems from duress. This speeds up response times and prevents irreversible losses. ## Conclusion The digital arrest scam is not just a fraud. It is a form of psychological captivity, where victims are imprisoned through fear on their own devices. In 2025, India saw a surge of such cases, stripping people of their savings and shaking trust in digital communications. The message is clear: scams no longer rely on technical breaches. They rely on exploiting human trust. For individuals, the defence is awareness and verification. For corporates, it is embedding strong protocols and encouraging a culture of questioning. For financial institutions, the challenge is profound. They must detect authorised transfers made under coercion, collaborate across borders, and deploy AI-powered defences that learn as fast as the criminals do. If 2024 was the year of deepfake deception, 2025 is becoming the year of coercion-based fraud. The industry’s response will determine whether scams like digital arrests remain isolated tragedies or become a systemic crisis. Protecting trust is no longer optional. It is the frontline of financial crime prevention. Blogs 25 Aug 2025 5 min read ## Stablecoins Are Booming. Is Compliance Falling Behind? Programmable money isn’t a futuristic buzzword anymore — it’s here, and it’s scaling at breakneck speed. In 2024, stablecoin transactions exceeded $27 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. From international remittances to e-commerce, stablecoins are reshaping how money moves across borders. But there’s a catch: the same features that make stablecoins so powerful — speed, cost efficiency, accessibility — also make them attractive for financial crime. Instant, irreversible, and identity-light transactions have created a compliance challenge unlike any before. For regulators, banks, and fintechs, the question is clear: can compliance scale as fast as stablecoins? ## The Rise of Stablecoins: More Than Just Crypto Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar or euro. Unlike Bitcoin or Ether, they aren’t designed for volatility — they’re designed for utility. That’s why they’ve become the backbone of digital payments and decentralised finance (DeFi). * **Cross-border remittances**: Workers abroad can send money home cheaply and instantly. * **Trading and settlements**: Exchanges use stablecoins as liquidity anchors. * **Merchant adoption**: From small retailers to payment giants like PayPal (with its **PYUSD stablecoin** launched in 2023), stablecoin rails are entering mainstream commerce. With global players like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) dominating, and even central banks exploring CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), it’s clear stablecoins are no longer niche. They are programmable, scalable, and systemically important. But scale brings scrutiny. ## The Compliance Gap: Why Old Tools Don’t Work Most financial institutions still rely on compliance infrastructure designed decades ago for slower, linear payment systems. Batch settlements, SWIFT messages, and pre-clearing windows gave compliance teams time to check, flag, or stop suspicious activity. Stablecoins operate on entirely different principles: * **Real-time settlement**: Transactions confirm in seconds. * **Pseudonymous wallets**: No guaranteed link between a wallet and its true owner. * **DeFi composability**: Funds can move through multiple protocols, contracts, and blockchains with no central chokepoint. * **Irreversibility**: Once sent, funds can’t be clawed back. This creates an environment where bad actors can launder funds at the speed of code. Legacy compliance systems — built for yesterday’s risks — simply cannot keep up. ## The New Typologies Emerging on Stablecoin Rails Financial crime doesn’t stand still. It adapts to new rails faster than regulation or compliance can. Here are some typologies unique to stablecoins: 1. **Money Mule Networks** Organised groups recruit international students or gig workers to act as “cash-out points,” moving illicit funds through stablecoin wallets before converting back to fiat. 2. **Cross-Chain Laundering** Criminals exploit bridges between blockchains (e.g., Ethereum to Tron or Solana) to break traceability, making it harder to follow the money. This tactic was highlighted in multiple reports after North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered hundreds of millions in stolen crypto across chains. 3. **DeFi Layering** Funds are routed through decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, or automated market makers to mix flows and obscure origins. The U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash in 2022 marked a watershed moment, underscoring how DeFi mixers can become systemic laundering tools. 4. **Sanctions Evasion** With traditional banking rails restricted, sanctioned entities increasingly turn to stablecoins. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has flagged stablecoin usage in multiple enforcement actions tied to Russia and other high-risk jurisdictions. Each of these typologies highlights the speed, complexity, and opacity of stablecoin-based laundering. They don’t look like traditional fiat red flags — they demand new methods of detection. ## What Compliance Needs to Look Like for Stablecoins To match the speed of programmable money, compliance must itself become programmable, adaptive, and dynamic. Static, rule-based systems are insufficient. Instead, compliance must shift to a risk infrastructure that is: ### 1. Risk-in-Motion Monitoring Rather than flagging transactions after they settle, monitoring must happen in real time, detecting structuring, layering, and unusual flow patterns as they unfold. ### 2. Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening Name checks aren’t enough. Risk detection must consider wallet metadata, behavioural history, device intelligence, and network analysis to surface high-risk entities hidden behind pseudonyms. ### 3. Wallet Risk Scoring A static “high-risk wallet list” doesn’t work in a world where wallets are created and discarded easily. Risk scoring must be dynamic and contextual, combining geolocation, device, transaction history, and counterparties into evolving risk profiles. This is compliance at the speed of programmable money. ## Tookitaki’s FinCense: Building the Trust Layer for Stablecoins At Tookitaki, we’re not retrofitting legacy tools to fit this new world. We’re building the infrastructure-grade compliance layer programmable money deserves. Here’s how [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite) powers trust on stablecoin rails: * **Risk-in-Motion Monitoring** Detects structuring, layering, and anomalous flows across chains in real time. * **Smart Sanctions & Wallet Screening** Goes beyond simple lists, screening metadata, networks, and behavioural red flags. * **Wallet Risk Scoring** Integrates device, location, and transaction intelligence to give every wallet a living, breathing risk profile. * **Federated Intelligence from the** [**AFC Ecosystem**](https://www.afcecosystem.org) Scenarios contributed by 200+ compliance experts worldwide enrich the system with the latest typologies. * **Agentic AI for Investigations** Accelerates investigations with an AI copilot, surfacing insights and reducing [false positives](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/false-positives). FinCense is modular, composable, and built for the future of programmable finance. Whether you’re a digital asset exchange, fintech, or bank integrating stablecoin rails, it enables you to operate with trust and resilience. ## Conclusion: Scaling Trust with Stablecoins Stablecoins are here to stay. They’re reshaping payments, cross-border transfers, and financial inclusion. But they’re also rewriting the rules of financial crime. The next phase of growth won’t be defined by speed or accessibility alone — it will be defined by trust. And trust comes from compliance that can move as fast and adapt as dynamically as programmable money itself. Stablecoins will define the next decade of finance. Whether they become rails for inclusion or loopholes for crime depends on how we build trust today. Tookitaki’s FinCense is here to make that trust possible. Blogs 20 Aug 2025 6 min read ## Ferraris, Ghost Cars, and Dirty Money: Inside Australia’s 2025 Barangaroo Laundering Scandal *In July 2025, Sydney’s Barangaroo precinct became the unlikely stage for one of Australia’s most audacious money laundering cases. Beyond the headlines about Ferraris and luxury goods lies a sobering truth: criminals are still exploiting the blind spots in Australia’s financial crime defences.* ## A Case That Reads Like a Movie Script On 30 July 2025, Australian police raided properties across Sydney and arrested two men—Bing “Michael” Li, 38, and Yizhe “Tony” He, 34. Both men were charged with an astonishing 194 fraud-related offences. Li faces 87 charges tied to AUD 12.9 million, while He faces 107 charges tied to about AUD 4 million. Authorities also froze AUD 38 million worth of assets, including Bentleys, Ferraris, designer goods, and property leases. At the heart of the case was a fraud and laundering scheme that funnelled stolen money into the high-end economy of cars, luxury fashion, and short-term property leases. Investigators dubbed them “ghost cars”—vehicles purchased as a way to obscure illicit funds. It’s a tale that grabs attention for its glitz, but what really matters is the deeper lesson: Australia still has critical AML blind spots that criminals know how to exploit. ## How the Syndicate Operated The mechanics of the scheme reveal just how calculated it was: * **Rapid loan cycling:** The accused are alleged to have obtained loans, often short-term, which were cycled quickly to create complex repayment patterns. This made tracing the origins of funds difficult. * **Luxury asset laundering:** The money was used to purchase high-value cars (Ferraris, Bentleys, Mercedes) and designer items from brands like Louis Vuitton. Assets of prestige become a laundering tool, integrating dirty money into seemingly legitimate wealth. * **Property as camouflage:** Short-term leases of expensive properties in Barangaroo and other high-end districts provided both a lifestyle cover and another channel to absorb illicit funds. * **Gatekeeper loopholes:** Real estate agents, accountants, and luxury dealers in Australia are not yet fully bound by AML/CTF obligations. This gap created the perfect playground for laundering. What’s striking is not the creativity of the scheme—it’s the simplicity. By targeting sectors without AML scrutiny, the syndicate turned everyday transactions into a pipeline for cleaning millions. ## The Regulatory Gap This case lands at a critical time. For years, Australia has been under pressure from the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.tookitaki.com/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf) to extend AML/CTF laws to the so-called “gatekeeper professions”—real estate agents, accountants, lawyers, and dealers in high-value goods. As of 2025, these obligations are still not fully in place. The expansion is only scheduled to take effect from July 2026. Until then, large swathes of the economy remain outside [AUSTRAC](https://www.tookitaki.com/blog/austrac-aml-ctf-regulations-guide)’s oversight. The Barangaroo arrests underscore what critics have long warned: criminals don’t wait for legislation. They are already steps ahead, embedding illicit funds into sectors that regulators have yet to fence off. For businesses in real estate, luxury retail, and professional services, this case is more than a headline—it’s a wake-up call to prepare now, not later. ## Why This Case Matters for Australia The Barangaroo case isn’t just about two individuals—it highlights systemic vulnerabilities in the Australian financial ecosystem. 1. **Criminal Adaptation:** Syndicates will always pivot to the weakest link. If banks tighten their checks, criminals move to less regulated industries. 2. **Erosion of Trust:** When high-value markets become conduits for laundering, it damages Australia’s reputation as a clean, well-regulated financial hub. 3. **Compliance Risk:** Businesses in these sectors risk being blindsided by new regulations if they don’t start implementing AML controls now. 4. **Global Implications:** With assets like luxury cars and crypto being easy to move or sell internationally, local failures in AML quickly ripple across borders. This isn’t an isolated story. It’s part of a broader trend where fraud, luxury assets, and regulatory lag intersect to create fertile ground for financial crime. ## Lessons for Businesses For financial institutions, fintechs, and gatekeeper industries, the Barangaroo case offers several practical takeaways: * **Monitor for rapid loan cycling:** Short-term loans repaid unusually fast, or loans tied to sudden high-value purchases, should trigger alerts. * **Scrutinise asset purchases:** Repeated luxury acquisitions, especially where the source of funds is vague, are classic laundering red flags. * **Don’t rely solely on regulation:** Just because AML obligations aren’t mandatory yet doesn’t mean businesses can ignore risk. Voluntary adoption of AML best practices can prevent reputational damage. * **Collaborate cross-sector:** Banks, real estate firms, and luxury dealers must share intelligence. Laundering rarely stays within one sector. * **Prepare for 2026:** When the law expands, regulators will expect not just compliance but also readiness. Being proactive now can avoid penalties later. ## How Tookitaki’s FinCense Can Help The Barangaroo case demonstrates a truth that regulators and compliance teams already know: criminals are fast, and rules often move too slowly. This is where [**FinCense**](https://www.tookitaki.com/products/anti-money-laundering-suite), Tookitaki’s AI-powered compliance platform, makes the difference. * **Scenario-based Monitoring** FinCense doesn’t just look for generic suspicious behaviour—it monitors for specific typologies like “rapid loan cycling leading to high-value asset purchases.” These scenarios mirror real-world cases, allowing institutions to spot laundering patterns early. * **Federated Intelligence** FinCense leverages insights from a global compliance community. A laundering method detected in one country can be quickly shared and simulated in others. If the Barangaroo pattern emerged elsewhere, FinCense could help Australian institutions adapt almost immediately. * **Agentic AI for Real-Time Detection** Criminal tactics evolve constantly. FinCense’s Agentic AI ensures models don’t go stale—it adapts to new data, learns continuously, and responds to threats as they arise. That means institutions don’t wait months for rule updates; they act in real time. * **End-to-End Compliance Coverage** From customer onboarding to transaction monitoring and investigation, FinCense provides a unified platform. For banks, this means capturing anomalies at multiple points, not just after funds have already flowed into cars and luxury handbags. The result is a system that doesn’t just tick compliance boxes but actively prevents fraud and laundering—protecting both businesses and Australia’s reputation. ## The Bigger Picture: Trust and Reputation Australia has ambitions to strengthen its role as a regional financial hub. But trust is the currency that underpins global finance. Cases like Barangaroo remind us that even one high-profile lapse can shake investor and customer confidence. With scams and laundering scandals making headlines globally—from Crown Resorts to major online frauds—Australia cannot afford to be reactive. For businesses, the message is clear: compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines, it’s about protecting your licence to operate. Customers and partners expect vigilance, transparency, and accountability. ## Conclusion: A Warning Shot The Barangaroo “ghost cars and luxury laundering” saga is more than a crime story—it’s a preview of what happens when regulation lags and businesses underestimate financial crime risk. With AUSTRAC set to extend AML coverage in 2026, industries like real estate and luxury retail must act now. Waiting until the law forces compliance could mean walking straight into reputational disaster. For financial institutions and businesses alike, the smarter path is to embrace advanced solutions like Tookitaki’s FinCense, which combine scenario-driven intelligence with adaptive AI. Because at the end of the day, Ferraris and Bentleys may be glamorous—but when they’re bought with dirty money, they carry a far higher cost.

Мы попытаемся разобраться с их пагубными последствиями для бизнеса и экономики в целом, а также понять методики, которые корпорации могут использовать, чтобы защитить себя от такой незаконной деятельности. Процесс отмывания денег (ОД) наносит значительный ущерб бизнесу, инвестиционному климату и экономической ситуации в целом. Это существенно **способствует росту преступности и коррупции и вызывает значительное снижение эффективности реального сектора экономики**. В результате эта преступная деятельность проявляется и многими другими последствиями. Масштабы такого противозаконного поведения в глобальном масштабе ошеломляют. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) сообщает, что каждый год от 2 до 5% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП) подвергается отмыванию денег на сумму от 754 миллиардов до 2 триллионов долларов. В юрисдикциях большинства стран **отмывание денег является тяжким преступлением, наказуемым лишением свободы и/или значительным штрафом.** Например, в Соединенных Штатах Америки наказание за соучастие в отмывании денег может быть довольно суровым: это либо штраф размером до 250 000 долларов или лишение свободы сроком до пяти лет. Многие предприятия могут не обращать внимания на реальность того, что их используют для отмывания денег. Несмотря на то, что не все коммерческие организации могут быть привлечены к ответственности за незаконную деятельность, осуществляемую через них, организации, обязанные соблюдать правила по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML), включая банки, должны соответствовать другому стандарту. **Последствия могут быть колоссальными, если противоправное поведение будет обнаружено в процессе аудита.** Например, Danske Bank недавно был оштрафован на 470 миллионов евро (495 миллионов долларов) из-за своего участия в международном скандале с отмыванием денег. Чтобы обезопасить свой бизнес от преступников и наложения нормативных штрафов, необходимо вникнуть в тонкости отмывания денег, включая распространенные схемы, которые обычно используются, и меры, которые можно предпринять для предотвращения этого. ## Что такое отмывание денег (ОД) и почему об этом важно знать Базовое определение процесса отмывания денег характеризуется умышленным сокрытием или искажением источника доходов, полученных незаконным путем, для создания впечатления, что средства были получены из законных источников. **Отмывание денег (ОД) предполагает действия, при которых злоумышленник скрывает источник средств, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности**, такой как незаконный оборот наркотиков, взяточничество или мошенничество. > *Действия по борьбе с отмыванием денег (ОД) часто связаны с борьбой с финансированием терроризма (ФТ), поскольку и ОД, и ФТ влекут за собой перенаправление средств.* Согласно выводам Группы разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ), ежегодно из стран с более низким уровнем дохода отмывается ошеломляющая сумма в 1,6 триллиона долларов, причём доходы, как правило, поступают от политической коррупции. В таких областях **коррупция усугубляет бедность, что ведёт к разрушению окружающей среды и вызывая экономический застой**. Из-за сложной связи между отмыванием денег и коррупцией любые инициативы, направленные на сдерживание распространения незаконных средств, также играют решающую роль в снижении уровня коррупции в глобальном масштабе. Такие виды деятельности, как незаконная продажа оружия, контрабанда и организованная преступность, включая незаконный оборот наркотиков и проституцию, могут приносить значительные суммы денег. Точно так же схемы хищения, инсайдерской торговли, взяточничества и компьютерного мошенничества могут приносить значительную прибыль и создавать стимулы для «узаконивания» доходов, полученных незаконным путём, посредством отмывания денег. Когда преступная деятельность приводит к значительной прибыли, **вовлечённые стороны должны найти способ сохранить контроль над средствами, не привлекая внимания к основной деятельности или причастным лицам**. Преступники делают это, маскируя источник средств, изменяя их форму или перемещая средства в место, где они с меньшей вероятностью привлекут внимание. В свете растущих опасений по поводу отмывания денег на саммите Большой семерки в Париже в 1989 году была создана Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) для выработки согласованного международного ответа. Одной из основных задач ФАТФ была разработка набора из 40 рекомендаций, в которых изложены меры, которые должны принять национальные правительства для реализации эффективных программ по борьбе с отмыванием денег. ## Сколько денег отмывается в год? По самой своей природе отмывание денег — это незаконная деятельность, совершаемая преступниками, которые действуют за пределами стандартных представлений об экономической и финансовой деятельности. В сочетании с другими аспектами скрытой экономической деятельности были предоставлены приблизительные значения, чтобы дать представление о масштабах рассматриваемой проблемы. Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности (УНП ООН) провело всесторонний анализ, чтобы установить размер незаконных средств, полученных от наркотрафика и организованной преступности, и степень отмывания этих средств. В отчёте УНП ООН приблизительно указано, что **в 2009 году преступные доходы составили 3,6% мирового валового внутреннего продукта (ВВП)**, при этом 2,7% (что эквивалентно 1,6 триллионам долларов США) этих доходов было отмыто. Это соответствует широко цитируемой оценке Международного валютного фонда (МВФ), согласно которой в 1998 году общий объём отмывания денег в мире может составлять от двух до пяти процентов мирового ВВП. Используя статистику 1998 года, эти проценты позволяют предположить, что феномен отмывания денег колеблется от 590 миллиардов долларов США до 1,5 триллионов долларов США. На тот момент нижняя цифра была примерно соизмерима с общим объёмом производства в экономике, сопоставимой по размеру с экономикой Испании. Однако при рассмотрении приведённых выше оценок необходимо проявлять осторожность. Они просто предназначены для приблизительного определения масштабов отмывания денег. **Из-за тайного характера транзакций точные статистические данные недоступны**, что делает невозможным точную оценку общемирового количества денег, отмываемых каждый год. Поэтому Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (ФАТФ) воздерживается от публикации каких-либо данных по этому поводу. ## Три основных этапа отмывания денег ### Этап размещения Незаконные средства могут быть интегрированы в финансовую систему прямо или косвенно. На этапе размещения наиболее распространенным методом является дробление больших сумм денег на более мелкие, менее заметные суммы, которые могут быть депонированы на один или несколько банковских счетов с использованием метода **«смурфинга»**. Компании по обслуживанию денег часто используются для осуществления смурфинга. **Другие методы размещения включают в себя:** * **Ложное выставление счетов-фактур** включает создание счетов-фактур за несуществующие товары или услуги для завышения или взимания платы за услуги, которые никогда не оказывались. Разница между фактической стоимостью товаров или услуг и завышенной суммой затем переводится как отмытые деньги. * **Смешивание незаконных денег с законными деньгами** — включает в себя внесение наличных, полученных в результате незаконной деятельности, на банковские счета с законно заработанными средствами, что затрудняет отслеживание незаконных средств правоохранительными органами. * **Покупка иностранной валюты** — включает в себя конвертацию больших сумм незаконных денег в другую валюту, которую затем можно положить на счета в иностранных банках или использовать для покупки активов в других странах. * **Покупка ценных бумаг или страховки за наличные** — предполагает покупку акций, облигаций или страховых полисов за наличные, которые впоследствии можно продать за чистые деньги. * **Азартные игры и ставки на спортивные события** — могут использоваться для отмывания денег путём размещения ставок за наличные деньги, полученные в результате незаконной деятельности, а затем получения выигрыша в виде чистых денег. ### Этап наслоения Процесс, известный как «наслоение», обозначает сложный набор действий, направленных на выявление незаконного происхождения денег и дальнейшую **маскировку их источника путём создания нескольких «слоёв» транзакций**, чтобы запутать след проверки. Эта изощренная практика служит цели сокрытия происхождения незаконно полученных активов, усложняя их обнаружение и отслеживание. Проведение фазы наслоения представляет собой наиболее сложную стадию этой мошеннической операции. Это влечёт за собой серию сложных финансовых транзакций, которые часто пересекают национальные границы посредством международных денежных переводов. Для реализации стратегии наслоения средства могут быть направлены через покупку и продажу различных типов инвестиций или через цепочку счетов, открытых в разных финансовых учреждениях в разных юрисдикциях. Такой капитал, полученный незаконным путём, часто перенаправляется в страны с разрешительными правилами по борьбе с отмыванием денег (БОД) или в страны, которые не сотрудничают с расследованиями по ПОД. ### Этап интеграции После того как незаконные деньги были успешно размещены и распределены, следующим этапом для преступников является реинтеграция или «возвращение» денег себе таким образом, чтобы скрыть их незаконное происхождение, сделав их «чистыми». По завершении этого этапа средства становятся частью законной финансовой системы и могут свободно использоваться преступниками. Основная цель этого этапа — **интегрировать деньги в экономику, не вызывая подозрений и не привлекая внимания правоохранительных органов**. Для достижения этой цели преступники могут приобретать такие активы, как недвижимость, произведения искусства, драгоценные украшения или дорогие автомобили, среди прочего. Эти виды активов могут служить для узаконивания ранее полученного незаконным путём капитала, поскольку они могут восприниматься как приобретённые законным путём. ## Как отмывание денег влияет на бизнес и экономику Отмывание денег представляет собой серьезную угрозу для бизнеса, что приводит к множеству неблагоприятных последствий, таких как потеря доходов, ущерб репутации и штрафы регулирующих органов на миллионы долларов или приостановление действия лицензий. Кроме того, социально-экономические последствия ОД имеют далеко идущие и разрушительные последствия с масштабным эффектом, таким как укоренение коррупции, эскалация преступной деятельности, подрыв доверия иностранных инвесторов, увеличение неравенства доходов и замедление экономического роста. Эти последствия вызывают особую озабоченность, поскольку они могут **осложнять и усугублять ранее существовавшие экономические и социальные проблемы**, создавая дальнейшую дестабилизацию и причиняя вред. Функционирование рынка банковских и финансовых услуг в рамках повышенных правовых, профессиональных и этических стандартов является неотъемлемой частью сохранения его целостности. Репутация финансового учреждения как честного является одним из его самых ценных активов. Предположим, что конкретное учреждение может обрабатывать средства, полученные в результате преступной деятельности, либо из-за взяточничества его сотрудников или директоров, либо из-за того, что они закрывают глаза на незаконный характер таких средств. В этом случае это **учреждение рискует стать активным соучастником преступников** и тем самым стать частью самой преступной сети. Любые доказательства такого соучастия обязательно навредят восприятию других финансовых посредников и регулирующих органов, помимо обычных клиентов. Неконтролируемое отмывание денег также чревато негативными макроэкономическими последствиями, такими как необъяснимые изменения в спросе на деньги, пруденциальные риски для надёжности банков, влияние “загрязнения” на законные финансовые операции и повышенная волатильность международных потоков капитала и обменных курсов из-за непредвиденных трансграничных переводов активов. Кроме того, успешное отмывание денег вознаграждает коррупцию и преступность, нанося ущерб целостности общества в целом, подрывая демократию и ставя под угрозу верховенство закона. Отмыватели денег постоянно ищут новые способы отмывания своих доходов, полученных нечестным путём. **Экономики с расширяющимися или появляющимися финансовыми центрами, но с недостаточными мерами защиты, особенно уязвимы**, поскольку страны с хорошо зарекомендовавшими себя финансовыми центрами внедряют обширные протоколы по борьбе с отмыванием денег. Отмыватели будут использовать различия в национальных системах борьбы с отмыванием денег, перемещая свои сети в страны и финансовые системы со слабыми или неэффективными мерами противодействия. Кто-то может возразить, что развивающиеся страны не могут быть слишком разборчивыми, когда речь идёт о привлечении капитала. Однако откладывать борьбу с мошенниками рискованно. Чем больше откладываются такие действия, тем более укоренившейся может стать организованная преступность. Подобно нарушению целостности конкретного финансового учреждения, присутствие организованной преступности, контролирующей и влияющей на коммерческий и финансовый сектор страны, **наносит ущерб прямым иностранным инвестициям**. > *Таким образом, борьба с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма имеет решающее значение для создания благоприятной деловой среды, что является необходимым условием устойчивого экономического развития.* Потенциальные социальные и политические последствия неустранённого или плохо управляемого отмывания денег могут быть серьёзными. Организованная преступность может проникнуть в финансовые учреждения, захватить контроль над значительной частью экономики посредством инвестиций или подкупить государственных чиновников и даже правительства. Экономическое и политическое влияние преступных организаций может подорвать общественное устройство, общие этические нормы и, в конечном счёте, демократические институты общества. В странах, переходящих к демократическим системам, криминальное влияние может подорвать этот переход. По своей сути **отмывание денег неразрывно связано с преступной деятельностью**, которая его породила. Благодаря отмыванию средств преступная деятельность может продолжаться. ## Как выявить и предотвратить отмывание денег Для обеспечения безопасности бизнеса и предотвращения финансовых преступлений необходимо внедрить комплексную программу соблюдения требований по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AML). Такая программа должна чётко определять процедуры выявления, оценки и сообщения о подозрительной финансовой деятельности. **Следующие меры являются ключевыми компонентами эффективной программы ПОД:** * **Надлежащая проверка клиентов (CDD)**: прежде чем клиенту будет разрешено пользоваться услугами компании, он должен пройти тщательную надлежащую проверку клиентов. Этот процесс включает в себя получение и проверку информации о клиентах, например, их документов, удостоверяющих личность, и оценку того, представляют ли они какой-либо потенциальный риск участия в преступной деятельности. * **Расширенная комплексная проверка (EDD)**: в случаях, когда существует более высокий риск отмывания денег, компании обязаны применять меры расширенной комплексной проверки. Одним из наиболее важных элементов EDD является тщательная проверка источников средств клиентов, чтобы убедиться, что они не получены в результате незаконной деятельности. * **Непрерывный мониторинг клиентов**: это дополнительный уровень управления рисками, который включает в себя постоянный мониторинг транзакций клиентов и проведение периодических проверок для выявления и оценки любых подозрительных действий. * **Независимые аудиты AML:** эти аудиты позволяют предприятиям выявлять и устранять любые недостатки и недочёты в своих стратегиях соблюдения AML до проверок регулирующими органами, чтобы предотвратить санкции или штрафы. * **KYT или мониторинг транзакций:** мониторинг транзакций — это непрерывный процесс обеспечения безопасности, который позволяет компаниям обнаруживать и предотвращать подозрительные транзакции. Надёжная программная платформа KYT может выявлять необычные схемы, тщательно проверять сомнительные переводы и отслеживать транзакции в цифровой или фиатной валюте. Это помогает предотвращать и выявлять отмывание денег и другие финансовые преступления. ## Услуги [АМЛ консалтинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/) [АМЛ поддержка](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-podderzhka/) [AML обучение](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-obuchenie/) [АМЛ аутсорсинг](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-autsorsing/) [Индивидуальные решения для аудита AML для бизнеса](https://coredo.eu/ru/aml-konsalting/aml-audit/) ОСТАВЬТЕ ЗАЯВКУ И ПОЛУЧИТЕ КОНСУЛЬТАЦИЮ * [Открытие банковских счетов](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/) + [По сферам](#) - [Для финансовых компаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-finansovyh-kompanij/) - [Для физических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-fizicheskih-lic/) - [Для юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/dlja-juridicheskih-lic/) - [Для криптокомпаний](https://coredo.eu/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/otkrytie-schetov-dlja-kriptokompanij/) + [По странам](#) - [Открыть счет в ОАЭ (Дубай)](https://coredo.eu/ru/oaje-dubaj/) - [Открыть счет в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/avstrija/) - [Открыть счет в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/velikobritanija/) - [Открыть счет в Сингапуре](https://coredo.eu/ru/singapur-2/) - [Другие страны](/ru/otkrytie-bankovskih-schetov/#countries) * [Регистрация юридических лиц](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) + [Разделы](#) - [Регистрация компании в Чехии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-chehii-2/) - [Регистрация компании в Словакии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-slovakii/) - [Регистрация компании на Кипре](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-na-kipre/) - [Регистрация компании в Люксембурге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ljuksemburge/) - [Регистрация компании в Гонконге](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-gonkonge/) - [Регистрация компании в Эстонии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-jestonii/) - [Регистрация компании в Греции](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-grecii/) - [Регистрация компании в Великобритании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-velikobritanii/) - [Регистрация компании в Ирландии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-irlandii/) - [Регистрация компании в Австрии](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-avstrii/) - [Регистрация компании в Испании](https://coredo.eu/ru/registracija-kompanii-v-ispanii/) - [Другие страны](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/registracija-juridicheskih-lic/) * [Инструменты для финансовых институтов](#) + [Разделы](#) - [Интернет эквайринг](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/internet-jekvajring/) - [Эмиссия карт](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/jemissija-kart-vypusk-debitovyh-kart/) - [SEPA/SWIFT, IBAN интеграция](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/sepa-swift-iban-integracii/) - [Паспортизация лицензий](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/pasportizacija-licenzij/) - [Программное обеспечение](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/instrumenty-dlja-finansovyh-institutov/programmnoe-obespechenie/) * [Бухгалтерское обслуживание](https://coredo.eu/ru/podderzhka-biznesa/buhgalterskoe-obsluzhivanie/) * [Компании на продажу](https://coredo.eu/ru/kompanii-na-prodazhu/) * [О компании COREDO](https://coredo.eu/ru/o-kompanii/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Контакты](https://coredo.eu/ru/kontakty/) * [Общие положения и условия](https://coredo.eu/ru/uslovija-i-polozhenija/) * [Политика использования файлов cookie](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-ispolzovanija-fajlov-cookie/) * [Политика конфиденциальности](https://coredo.eu/ru/politika-konfidencialnosti/) * [Объявление о политике информирования](https://coredo.eu/ru/obyavlenie-o-politike-informirovaniya-whistleblowing/) * [Блог](https://coredo.eu/ru/novosti/) * [Подписаться на новости](#subscribe) * [Информационное предупреждение](https://coredo.eu/ru/informacionnoe-preduprezhdenie/) * [Словарь](https://coredo.eu/ru/dictionary/) [+420 228 886 867](tel:+420 228 886 867 \"Phone\") [info@coredo.eu](mailto:info@coredo.eu \"Email\") K Cervenemu dvoru 3269/25a, Прага, 130 00, Чехия [Карта сайта](https://coredo.eu/ru/karta-sajta/) © 2025 Авторские права ©RES JUDICATA s.r.o.

[ENG](http://din-eka.com/ \"Switch to english version\") Прозрачность и подотчетность - ключевые аспекты современного корпоративного управления ====================================================================================== 07.06.2024 11:50 ![Image 2](https://dineka.ru/upload/medialibrary/6cf/6cfb199dfe2492feb845e128005e447d.png) Многие страны ввели законодательные изменения, направленные на повышение прозрачности корпоративного управления. Эти меры помогают бороться с финансовыми преступлениями, коррупцией и улучшить деловую репутацию компаний на международной арене. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты этих изменений и их влияние на бизнес. ##### Международные изменения в законодательстве * **AMLD в ЕС** Директива Европейского Союза по борьбе с отмыванием денег (AMLD) представляет собой серию мер, направленных на усиление прозрачности и подотчетности. Последние изменения включают требования к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах, создание централизованных регистров и обязательное сообщение о подозрительных транзакциях. Эти меры направлены на предотвращение отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма. * **Законы о корпоративной прозрачности в США** В США Законы о корпоративной прозрачности, такие как Закон о корпоративной прозрачности 2020 года (Corporate Transparency Act), требуют от компаний раскрытия информации о своих конечных бенефициарных владельцах в FinCEN. Это помогает правительственным органам бороться с незаконными финансовыми операциями и повышает уровень корпоративной подотчетности. * **Инициативы G20** Инициативы G20 включают в себя автоматический обмен информацией о финансовых счетах между странами-членами. Это значительно усложняет уклонение от уплаты налогов и способствует более прозрачной и справедливой налоговой системе. Эти меры также включают рекомендации по внедрению стандартов прозрачности и подотчетности на национальном уровне. ##### Международные стандарты и рекомендации Для повышения прозрачности и подотчётности в корпоративном управлении, а также для борьбы с финансовыми преступлениями, на международном уровне были разработаны и внедрены несколько ключевых стандартов и рекомендаций. Рассмотрим их подробнее. * **Директивы FATF** Группа разработки финансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег (FATF) разрабатывает международные стандарты по борьбе с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. Рекомендации FATF включают требования к идентификации клиентов, мониторингу транзакций и отчетности о подозрительных действиях. * **OECD Guidelines** Руководящие принципы Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (OECD) по корпоративному управлению включают рекомендации по прозрачности, подотчетности и соблюдению этических стандартов. Эти принципы помогают компаниям улучшить свои управленческие практики и повысить доверие со стороны заинтересованных сторон. * **ISO 37001** ISO 37001 — международный стандарт по системам управления антикоррупционной деятельностью, который предоставляет руководство по предотвращению, выявлению и реагированию на коррупцию. Внедрение этого стандарта помогает компаниям минимизировать риски коррупции и повысить уровень корпоративной этики. ##### Новые вызовы для корпоративного управления Компании должны уделять больше внимания процессам проверки и утверждения своих контрагентов. Это связано с усилением требований к раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах и топ-менеджерах, которые могут оказывать значительное влияние на деятельность компании. В частности, внимание уделяется следующим аспектам: * Окончательные владельцы (UBO). В законодательстве многих стран усилились требования по раскрытию информации о физических лицах, которые в конечном итоге контролируют компанию. Это помогает бороться с отмыванием денег и финансированием терроризма. * Профессиональные CEO. Компании должны убедиться, что их руководители обладают не только профессиональными навыками, но и соответствуют высоким стандартам этики и подотчётности. * Значимые бенефициары. Необходимо учитывать влияние значимых бенефициаров на стратегические решения компании и обеспечить их прозрачность. ##### Почему это важно? Проверка контрагентов и раскрытие информации о них имеет несколько ключевых преимуществ: * **Снижение рисков.** Компании могут лучше защищаться от финансовых преступлений и коррупции, зная, кто именно контролирует их контрагентов. * **Укрепление репутации.** Прозрачность и подотчётность повышают доверие инвесторов и партнёров. * **Соблюдение законодательства.** Соблюдение международных и национальных требований помогает избежать штрафов и юридических проблем. * **Улучшение бизнес-отношений.** Прозрачные процедуры способствуют укреплению доверия и партнёрских отношений. ##### Санкции за несоблюдение требований Компании, не соблюдающие требования по раскрытию информации и проверке контрагентов, могут столкнуться с серьезными санкциями: * **Финансовые штрафы.** Значительные денежные штрафы, налагаемые регуляторами. * **Юридические последствия.** Судебные разбирательства и уголовные преследования. * **Репутационные потери.** Потеря доверия и деловой репутации. Вот несколько интересных примеров как недостаточные проверки привели к серьёзным потерям: * **Airbnb и незаконная сдача жилья в аренду** В 2020 году компания Airbnb столкнулась с юридическими проблемами в Германии из-за того, что не проверяла легальность сдачи жилья в аренду. Власти Берлина обвинили компанию в том, что она позволяла сдавать квартиры без соответствующих разрешений, что нарушало местные законы о краткосрочной аренде. В результате Airbnb пришлось заплатить значительные штрафы и изменить свои процедуры проверки арендодателей, чтобы соответствовать местным законам. Этот случай подчеркивает важность проверки соответствия контрагентов местным законодательным требованиям. * **Standard Chartered и отмывание денег** В 2019 году банк Standard Chartered был оштрафован на 1,1 миллиарда долларов за нарушение законов о борьбе с отмыванием денег в США и Великобритании. Расследование показало, что банк не проводил достаточную проверку своих клиентов и их транзакций, что позволило преступным организациям отмывать деньги через его счета. Недостаточная проверка привела к финансовым и репутационным потерям для банка и подчеркнула необходимость строгих процедур соблюдения норм по борьбе с отмыванием денег. * **Danske Bank и скандал с отмыванием денег** В 2018 году Danske Bank оказался в центре одного из крупнейших скандалов с отмыванием денег в Европе. Через эстонское подразделение банка прошло около 200 миллиардов евро подозрительных транзакций. В результате банк был оштрафован на сотни миллионов долларов, его руководство подверглось серьезной критике, и банк понес огромные репутационные потери. Расследование показало, что банк не проверял должным образом своих клиентов и не проводил адекватный мониторинг транзакций. * **Volkswagen и нарушение требований по проверке поставщиков** В 2015 году разразился скандал с Volkswagen, когда выяснилось, что компания использовала программное обеспечение для обхода экологических тестов на выбросы. Расследование показало, что компания недостаточно проверяла своих поставщиков и производителей компонентов, что позволило этим нарушениям оставаться незамеченными. Скандал привел к штрафам на миллиарды долларов и нанес серьёзный ущерб репутации компании. ##### Выводы Современные требования к проверке контрагентов и раскрытию информации о бенефициарных владельцах требуют от компаний пересмотра своих внутренних процессов и структур. Прозрачность и подотчётность становятся неотъемлемыми элементами успешного корпоративного управления. Внедрение этих изменений не только поможет компаниям соответствовать законодательным требованиям, но и укрепит их позиции на рынке, повышая доверие со стороны инвесторов и партнёров. Внедрение новых стандартов корпоративного управления и проверок контрагентов играет ключевую роль в глобальной борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями. Более строгие процедуры помогают выявлять и предотвращать попытки отмывания денег и финансирования терроризма (с) Деловой центр \"ДИНЕКА\" Д.Е.

finance, les gatekeepers tels que les comptables et les avocats sont censés se prémunir contre la criminalité financière. Pourtant, ces mêmes acteurs peuvent parfois devenir des partenaires involontaires, voire complices, de systèmes de blanchiment d\\'argent. L\\'expertise qui rend ces professionnels indispensables aux entreprises offre également aux criminels la possibilité de les exploiter dans le cadre d\\'activités illicites. Dans cet article, nous examinerons comment ces intermédiaires peuvent être utilisés pour blanchir des fonds illégaux, la législation relative aux gatekeepers et à la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, ainsi que des exemples concrets d\\'utilisation de ces intermédiaires à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent. Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'un gatekeeper ? ---------------------------- Un **gatekeeper** est une personne ou une entité qui contrôle l\\'accès à quelque chose, agissant souvent comme une barrière ou un filtre entre différentes parties. Dans divers contextes, les gatekeepers ont l\\'autorité ou la responsabilité de réglementer, de gérer ou de contrôler l\\'entrée, la participation ou le flux d\\'informations ou de ressources. ![Image 10: Gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-lawyers.png) Dans le **contexte financier et juridique**, les gatekeepers sont des professionnels tels que des comptables, des avocats, des banquiers, des auditeurs et d\\'autres experts chargés de garantir l\\'intégrité et la légalité des transactions et des activités financières. Quelles sont les tâches des gatekeepers dans le cadre de la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent ? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Le rôle du [gatekeeper dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux](https://febelfin.be/media/pages/publicaties/2021/banken-gatekeepers-in-de-strijd-tegen-witwassen/23291479c0-1694763198/brochure_aml_en.pdf)implique un devoir de vigilance permanent tout au long de la relation d\\'affaires : * 1 **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Comprendre parfaitement l\\'identité et les antécédents du client. Cela se fait généralement lors de l\\'onboarding de nouveaux clients, afin de s\\'assurer que leurs activités sont conformes aux normes juridiques et éthiques. * 2 **Know Your Transaction (KYT)**: Contrôler et comprendre la nature des transactions du client. Le KYT permet d\\'identifier les transactions suspectes ou inhabituelles qui peuvent indiquer une activité illicite, telle que le blanchiment d\\'argent, en signalant les incohérences par rapport au comportement attendu. * 3 **Vérifier l\\'origine des actifs**: S\\'assurer que les actifs impliqués dans les transactions proviennent de sources légitimes. Cela devient particulièrement important lorsque les transactions ou les transferts d\\'actifs d\\'un client sont anormaux ou ne correspondent pas à ses antécédents financiers. * 4 **Risk-Based Approach**: mise en oeuvre de mesures fondées sur le niveau de risque associé à chaque client et à chaque transaction. Les clients ou les transactions considérés comme présentant un risque plus élevé, tels que ceux impliquant des transferts de grande valeur ou des [personnes politiquement exposées (PPE)](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/personne-politiquement-expos%C3%A9e-ppe/), font l\\'objet d\\'une vigilance accrue, tandis que les clients présentant un risque moins élevé peuvent faire l\\'objet de contrôles moins stricts. * 5 **Respecter les embargos financiers**: Respecter les restrictions légales sur les transactions financières avec certaines entités ou certains pays. La conformité est essentielle pour éviter les sanctions et empêcher la facilitation des transactions illicites. * 6 **Limiter l\\'utilisation de l\\'argent liquide**: La limitation des transactions en espèces est une mesure essentielle dans la lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, car l\\'argent liquide est difficile à retracer et est couramment utilisé dans les activités illicites. * 7 **Obligations de déclaration**: Les professionnels désignés sont légalement tenus de signaler aux autorités compétentes, telles que la cellule de renseignement financier (CRF) locale, toute activité suspecte susceptible d\\'indiquer un blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'autres délits financiers. * 8 **Conformité et adaptation continue**: Les gatekeepers doivent se tenir au courant des best practices, réviser les protocoles internes et s\\'assurer qu\\'ils sont bien formés pour reconnaître et traiter les risques liés au blanchiment d\\'argent et à la criminalité financière. Comment les gatekeepers sont-ils utilisés pour le blanchiment d\\'argent ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Les gatekeepers sont utilisés de diverses manières pour contribuer au blanchiment d\\'argent pour le compte de criminels. En voici quelques exemples : **Rôle des professionnels du domaine légal** **Création de sociétés écrans**: Les avocats sont souvent utilisés pour créer des sociétés écrans et des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui dissimulent la propriété et l\\'origine des fonds. Les avocats peuvent concevoir des structures de sociétés à plusieurs niveaux avec des entités dans différentes juridictions, ce qui rend difficile pour les autorités de retracer les flux d\\'argent ou d\\'identifier les véritables propriétaires. [![Image 11: Gatekeepers and shell companies](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-shell-companies-FR.jpg) **Transactions immobilières**: Les avocats jouent un rôle essentiel dans l\\'[organisation des transactions immobilières](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/comment-blanchir-argent-de-immobilier-aml/), la gestion des contrats et le respect des exigences légales et réglementaires. Les criminels exploitent souvent cette possibilité en achetant des propriétés de grande valeur avec de l\\'argent blanchi, ce qui leur permet d\\'intégrer ces fonds illicites dans l\\'économie légitime. [![Image 12: Gatekeepers and real estate](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-real-estate-FR.jpg) **Rôle des comptables et des auditeurs** **Manipulation des états financiers**: Les comptables peuvent se livrer à des activités frauduleuses en falsifiant les documents financiers pour masquer la véritable nature des fonds. Ils peuvent gonfler les chiffres d\\'affaires en créant de fausses transactions commerciales, en émettant de fausses factures ou en enregistrant des ventes inexistantes afin de donner une fausse image de la santé financière d\\'une entreprise. En outre, ils peuvent manipuler les flux de revenus en fabriquant des revenus provenant de produits ou de services inexistants. [![Image 13: Gatekeepers and financial statement manipulation](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-financial-statement-manipulation-FR.jpg) **Les stratagèmes d\\'évasion fiscale**: Les comptables peuvent s\\'engager dans des pratiques telles que la fabrication de dépenses et la sous-déclaration de revenus pour créer un profil financier trompeur. Cette manipulation permet non seulement [de réduire les obligations fiscales](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-and-crime.html), mais contribue également à la mise en place d\\'une structure complexe qui rend de plus en plus difficile l\\'identification de la véritable source des fonds. [![Image 14: Gatekeepers and illegal tax schemes](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg)](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-tax-schemes-FR.jpg) Quels sont les exemples d\\'utilisation de gatekeepers à des fins de blanchiment d\\'argent ? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au Canada, plusieurs avocats ont été impliqués dans des affaires de blanchiment d\\'argent ou d\\'activités financières suspectes, mettant en évidence leur rôle involontaire ou délibéré dans la facilitation d\\'opérations criminelles. Parmi les cas les plus marquants, on peut citer : * **Simon Rosenfeld**, un avocat de Toronto qui a [été condamné en 2005](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/5-canadian-lawyers-accused-of-money-laundering-or-suspicious-financial-transactions-1.6942083) après s\\'être vanté auprès d\\'un agent infiltré du laxisme du Canada en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. Sa peine a été alourdie en appel. * **Florence Yen**, une avocate spécialisée dans l\\'immobilier à Vancouver, qui a été suspendue pendant trois mois en 2021 pour avoir manipulé plus de 14 millions de dollars provenant d\\'un client sans fournir de services juridiques ni enquêter sur l\\'origine des fonds. * **Ronald Pelletier**, radié du barreau en 2023, pour avoir déplacé 31 millions de dollars pour le compte de clients impliqués dans des fraudes boursières aux États-Unis, en utilisant des téléphones à mémoire cachée pour dissimuler ses activités. En Europe, le [scandale de la Danske Bank en 2018](https://www.euronews.com/2022/12/14/danske-bank-fined-470m-over-international-money-laundering-scandal) est un cas bien connu d\\'avocats ayant permis le blanchiment d\\'argent. Ce scandale a révélé le rôle des professionnels, y compris des avocats, dans la facilitation du blanchiment d\\'environ 200 milliards d\\'euros de fonds suspects par l\\'intermédiaire de la succursale estonienne de la banque entre 2007 et 2015. Les avocats ont abusé du contrôle réglementaire indulgent de l\\'Estonie et ont créé des sociétés écrans avec des structures d\\'entreprise complexes qui impliquaient des transactions transfrontalières. Quelle est la réglementation en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les gatekeepers ? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ La législation visant à réglementer les gatekeepers comprend des dispositions qui exigent de ces professionnels qu\\'ils mettent en oeuvre de solides mesures de lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux (AML) et qu\\'ils signalent les activités suspectes. Voici quelques cadres législatifs et mesures clés : **Union européenne** ![Image 15: EU AML directive gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-europe-eu.png) L\\'[Union européenne a adopté plusieurs directives](https://pideeco.be/fr/articles/eu-directives-anti-blanchiment/) (e.g. la 4e et 5e directive AML) qui fixent des exigences en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent pour les personnes chargées du contrôle et d\\'autres professionnels. Il s\\'agit notamment d\\'obligations en matière d\\'évaluation des risques, de vigilance à l\\'égard des clients et de déclaration des transactions suspectes. Les gatekeepers jouent un rôle essentiel en veillant à ce que les entreprises tiennent des registres précis de leurs structures de propriété. Ils sont chargés de faciliter le respect des réglementations qui exigent que ces informations sur la propriété soient accessibles aux autorités compétentes et aux entités obligées. La cinquième directive anti-blanchiment souligne encore cette responsabilité en exigeant que les informations relatives à la propriété soient mises à la disposition des personnes et des entités ayant un intérêt légitime. **États-Unis d\\'Amérique** Le Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) exige des entités de contrôle qu\\'elles établissent et maintiennent des programmes efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, qu\\'elles fassent preuve de diligence à l\\'égard des clients, qu\\'elles établissent des déclarations sur les activités suspectes (SAR) et qu\\'elles se conforment à d\\'autres exigences en matière de rapports. La loi prévoit également des sanctions en cas de non-respect de ces obligations. Les gatekeepers sont également tenus d\\'établir un rapport sur les transactions en devises (CTR) pour tout dépôt, retrait, échange de devises ou autre paiement ou transfert impliquant plus de $10.000 en espèces ou plus au cours d\\'une même journée. ![Image 16: Currency transaction reports for gatekeepers](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-transactions.png) Il existe également la [Gatekeeper Initiative](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminaljustice/gatekeeper_faq.pdf), une initiative gouvernementale visant à imposer des exigences strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent et le financement du terrorisme aux principaux professionnels qui agissent en tant que gatekeepers des systèmes financiers nationaux et internationaux. **Groupe d\\'action financière (GAFI)** Le GAFI reconnaît le rôle essentiel que jouent les gatekeepers dans la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Il encourage les pays à appliquer ses recommandations concernant les gatekeepers dans le cadre de leurs lois et réglementations nationales, afin de renforcer le cadre général de la lutte contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. Dans l\\'[examen horizontal de la conformité technique des entités de contrôle en matière de corruption](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfgeneral/Gatekeeper-TC-Corruption.html) réalisé en 2024, il a été noté que si de nombreux membres du GAFI ont obtenu un score supérieur à 80 % en ce qui concerne l\\'application des recommandations du GAFI sur les entités de contrôle, sept grandes économies - représentant plus de la moitié du PIB mondial - ont obtenu un score inférieur à 50 %. Des obligations essentielles telles que le devoir de vigilance à l\\'égard de la clientèle restent faibles. Il est nécessaire de maintenir un contrôle et un équilibre sur les gatekeepers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Les gatekeepers sont essentiels au système financier, et leur rôle et expertise peuvent être exploités par les blanchisseurs d\\'argent pour intégrer, superposer et finalement légitimer des fonds illicites. C\\'est pourquoi il est essentiel d\\'imposer à ces professionnels des obligations strictes en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent. ![Image 17: Gatekeepers and KYC](https://pideeco.be/assets/images/articles/content/gatekeepers-aml-money-laundering-kyc.png) Des mesures efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d\\'argent, notamment des procédures de connaissance du client (KYC), le suivi des transactions et la déclaration des activités suspectes, permettent de s\\'assurer que les gatekeepers constituent une barrière plutôt qu\\'un canal pour les activités de blanchiment d\\'argent. Pour empêcher les gatekeepers de faciliter le blanchiment de capitaux, il faut adopter une approche globale impliquant l\\'application de la réglementation, des contrôles internes rigoureux et une surveillance proactive. En mettant en oeuvre ces stratégies, nous pouvons renforcer les défenses du système financier contre le blanchiment de capitaux et veiller à ce que les gatekeepers remplissent leur rôle essentiel dans la prévention de la criminalité financière.

Alors que les régulateurs financiers du monde entier ne cessent de souligner l'importance des protocoles AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CRS (Common Reporting Standard) et FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), certaines institutions commettent des erreurs, intentionnelles ou non, et s'exposent à des conséquences bien plus terrifiantes que prévu. Ces réglementations sont conçues pour assurer la sécurité, la transparence et la résistance du secteur financier aux activités illicites telles que le blanchiment d'argent, l'évasion fiscale et le financement du terrorisme. Cependant, la non-conformité entraîne souvent de lourdes sanctions pécuniaires, des perturbations opérationnelles et le spectre effrayant de la ruine de la réputation. Ce billet explore quelques-uns des exemples les plus alarmants d'institutions hantées par les coûts « effrayants » des manquements à la conformité et explique pourquoi le fait de donner la priorité au respect de la réglementation peut vous éviter une frayeur inattendue. ### Violations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent (LAB) constituent la première défense du secteur financier contre le blanchiment d'argent, le financement du terrorisme et d'autres activités économiques criminelles. Les réglementations en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent obligent les institutions financières à mettre en œuvre des procédures rigoureuses, notamment des protocoles de connaissance du client (KYC), des systèmes de surveillance et des rapports sur les activités suspectes. En appliquant ces réglementations, des autorités comme le FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) aux États-Unis et divers régulateurs financiers européens visent à empêcher les criminels d'intégrer des fonds illicites dans le système financier légitime. Pourtant, malgré ces protocoles stricts, de nombreuses institutions ont connu des défaillances qui leur ont coûté cher en termes de finances et de réputation. Certaines des amendes les plus célèbres du secteur en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent rappellent ce qui peut se produire lorsque la diligence raisonnable n'est pas respectée. #### 1. HSBC – Un rappel de 1,9 milliard de dollars sur la négligence en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Dans le cadre de l'une des plus importantes amendes infligées en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, HSBC a été condamnée en 2012 à une pénalité stupéfiante de 1,9 milliard de dollars pour avoir enfreint les lois relatives à la lutte contre le blanchiment. Elle n'avait notamment pas mis en place de contrôles efficaces de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et avait traité des transactions pour des cartels de la drogue au Mexique et d'autres clients à haut risque. Le ministère américain de la justice, en collaboration avec le FinCEN et d'autres agences, a mené l'enquête, qui a mis au jour de graves lacunes en matière de diligence raisonnable à l'égard des clients, des contrôles internes inadéquats et des systèmes de surveillance médiocres. La négligence de HSBC a permis à des criminels de faire transiter des milliards de dollars par ses systèmes sans éveiller de soupçons. Les conséquences ont été terribles pour HSBC. Outre le coup financier, l'institution a dû faire face à une surveillance publique intense, à des batailles juridiques et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Elle a été contrainte de revoir ses procédures de conformité, d'investir des millions dans des technologies de conformité et d'embaucher des milliers de responsables de la conformité. Le nom de la banque, autrefois synonyme de fiabilité, a été associé à l'un des plus grands scandales de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent du secteur - une réputation obsédante qui a perduré longtemps après la sanction. #### 2. Danske Bank – Une toile de milliards blanchis Le scandale de blanchiment d'argent de la Danske Bank est un autre exemple notoire. Entre 2007 et 2015, la succursale estonienne de Danske aurait blanchi environ 230 milliards de dollars de transactions suspectes, provenant principalement de clients russes. Bien que le scandale ait été rendu public en 2018, l'amende infligée par les régulateurs danois a rappelé le coût élevé des défaillances en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent. L'enquête a révélé que la banque ne disposait pas de contrôles suffisants, ce qui a permis à un réseau de criminels d'exploiter ses systèmes pour effectuer des transactions illicites. Les autorités de régulation danoises et estoniennes, ainsi que plusieurs organismes internationaux, ont jugé que la banque était complice de l'un des plus grands systèmes de blanchiment d'argent en Europe. Les répercussions ne se sont pas limitées à des amendes ; la Danske Bank a dû faire face à des poursuites judiciaires, à la contestation des actionnaires et à une grave atteinte à sa réputation. Des cadres supérieurs ont démissionné et la réputation de la banque a été fortement entamée, jetant une longue ombre sur ses opérations et ses relations avec les clients. Ce scandale a mis en évidence les dangers liés à la faiblesse des systèmes de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, illustrant comment le non-respect des protocoles de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent peut entraîner des dommages financiers et des atteintes à la réputation considérables. #### Analyse des manquements à la conformité : Les pièges courants de la lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent Les exemples de HSBC et de Danske Bank mettent en évidence les pièges les plus courants en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent : - Diligence insuffisante à l'égard des clients : Des clients insuffisamment contrôlés peuvent exploiter les systèmes financiers à des fins de blanchiment d'argent. - Faiblesse des contrôles internes : L'absence de cadres solides de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent et de gestion des risques expose les institutions à l'exploitation criminelle. - Systèmes de surveillance inefficaces : En l'absence de suivi des transactions en temps réel et de détection des anomalies, les activités suspectes peuvent passer inaperçues. Dans les deux cas, l'absence de mesures de conformité et l'absence d'une culture de la conformité ont amplifié l'impact. Lorsque les institutions négligent le respect de la réglementation, elles s'exposent involontairement à des amendes substantielles et à des poursuites judiciaires. ### Sanctions et montages offshore La conformité financière est semée d'embûches coûteuses, en particulier en ce qui concerne les violations des sanctions et l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger. Les sanctions pour non-conformité dans ces domaines sont parmi les plus sévères, car les organismes de réglementation du monde entier appliquent des sanctions strictes pour dissuader les institutions financières de contourner les lois économiques ou de soutenir des activités illicites. Les sanctions américaines jouent un rôle essentiel dans la sauvegarde de la sécurité nationale en limitant les transactions financières avec les pays impliqués dans le terrorisme ou les violations des droits de l'homme. Les banques qui ignorent ou tentent de contourner ces restrictions s'exposent à de graves conséquences économiques et à des atteintes à leur réputation. #### 3. BNP Paribas - Une pénalité record de 8,9 milliards de dollars pour violation des sanctions En 2014, BNP Paribas (BNPP), l'une des plus grandes institutions financières françaises, a reçu une amende record de 8,9 milliards de dollars après avoir plaidé coupable d'avoir traité des transactions pour le Soudan, l'Iran et Cuba, des pays soumis à des sanctions américaines strictes. Cette amende massive a mis en lumière les conséquences de la conspiration pluriannuelle de la BNPP visant à contourner les lois américaines sur les sanctions et les stratagèmes élaborés par la banque pour éviter d'être détectée.La BNPP a utilisé des « banques satellites » et des entités sanctionnées déguisées dans des transactions pour contourner les sanctions, faisant transiter plus de 8,8 milliards de dollars par le système américain. Malgré les avertissements juridiques, la banque a poursuivi ces pratiques à des fins lucratives, notamment en soutenant des banques soudanaises liées au terrorisme. Cette situation a eu des répercussions importantes, notamment des amendes imposées par le ministère de la justice, la Réserve fédérale et l'OFAC, des poursuites pénales et une suspension d'un an des opérations de compensation en dollars. La BNPP a également dû licencier des cadres supérieurs et investir massivement dans des réformes de conformité. #### 4. Credit Suisse - Systèmes d'évasion fiscale offshore et pénalité de 1,8 milliard de dollars Le Crédit Suisse, une banque suisse à l'histoire mouvementée, a été impliqué dans l'aide apportée à des contribuables américains pour leur permettre d'échapper à l'impôt en dissimulant des actifs sur des comptes offshore. En 2014, la banque a plaidé coupable à une accusation de complot pour avoir aidé des clients américains à dissimuler leur fortune, ce qui lui a valu une amende de 1,8 milliard de dollars. Cette affaire a relancé l'examen mondial du rôle des banques suisses dans la facilitation de l'évasion fiscale à l'étranger et de l'efficacité des accords de plaidoyer pour prévenir les violations répétées.Un rapport de la commission des finances du Sénat a révélé que le Crédit suisse n'avait peut-être pas respecté l'accord qu'il avait conclu, en mettant en évidence les services qu'il avait rendus à des personnalités de premier plan comme Dan Horsky, qui avait dissimulé 220 millions de dollars par l'intermédiaire de membres de sa famille et de sociétés écrans. Des documents internes montrent que des banquiers chevronnés ont modifié les détails des comptes pour échapper à la surveillance de l'IRS en utilisant la double nationalité pour masquer l'identité des clients. Le rapport a également mis au jour des comptes non divulgués transférés vers d'autres banques, ce qui a suscité des appels en faveur d'une intensification des enquêtes sur le Credit Suisse et d'autres banques suisses. Ces révélations ont entaché la réputation du Credit Suisse et relancé la demande d'une application plus stricte de la FATCA et de la réglementation sur les déclarations à l'étranger, notamment en ce qui concerne les comptes à double nationalité et l'évasion fiscale. #### Les défis de la conformité : Pourquoi les institutions se débattent-elles avec les sanctions et les réglementations offshore ? La conformité aux sanctions et aux réglementations offshore est complexe pour les institutions financières, car elle exige des contrôles, une surveillance et des rapports rigoureux. Les défis à relever sont les suivants :- Contrôle des transactions : Un contrôle efficace est nécessaire pour empêcher les fonds d'atteindre les entités figurant sur la liste noire. Les tactiques de dissimulation de BNP Paribas mettent en évidence les risques de détection des pratiques occultes.- Questions relatives aux données sur les clients : La conformité offshore nécessite une identification précise des clients, en particulier pour les personnes ayant une double nationalité. La situation du Crédit Suisse a révélé des problèmes liés à une déclaration inadéquate de ces comptes.- Coordination transfrontalière : Les institutions doivent s'aligner sur les différentes réglementations mondiales et locales, comme l'a montré le Credit Suisse en gérant les protocoles de conformité entre les différentes juridictions.Les sanctions infligées à BNP Paribas et au Crédit Suisse montrent les graves conséquences des manquements à la conformité, et soulignent la nécessité d'une approche proactive de la conformité pour atténuer les risques financiers et les risques pour la réputation. ### Conclusion #### Éviter les coûts effrayants des violations de la conformité Les amendes faramineuses et les atteintes à la réputation constatées dans des affaires comme celles de HSBC, Danske Bank, BNP Paribas et Credit Suisse révèlent les enjeux considérables de la conformité financière. Ces histoires édifiantes rappellent aux institutions que les manquements en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent, de sanctions ou de réglementations offshore sont coûteux et laissent une ombre durable sur la crédibilité d'une institution et la confiance de ses clients. Avec l'augmentation de la surveillance réglementaire et de la responsabilité publique, la conformité ne peut plus être considérée comme une simple fonction d'arrière-guichet - c'est un élément vital de l'intégrité opérationnelle et de la réussite stratégique.Les institutions financières doivent donner la priorité à des cadres de conformité rigoureux, investir dans des systèmes de contrôle de pointe et instaurer une culture de la responsabilité dans l'ensemble de leurs opérations. Ces mesures proactives sont essentielles pour éviter les conséquences « effrayantes » qui ont hanté d'autres acteurs du secteur. En s'engageant à respecter scrupuleusement les règles de conformité, les institutions se protègent contre de graves répercussions financières et juridiques et préservent leur réputation sur un marché mondial où la confiance et la transparence sont indispensables. #### Share: ### TWC Staff ### Related News [Conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/conformité) ### [08 | Simplifier la conformité dans les îles Caïmans](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/08-simplifier-la-conformite-dans-les-iles-caimans?hsLang=fr) [Article](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/article) ### [Fortnite: les achats dans le jeu et les violations de la vie privée entraînent des amendes massives](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/fortnite-les-achats-dans-le-jeu-et-les-violations-de-la-vie-privee-entrainent-des-amendes-massives?hsLang=fr) [Blog](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/tag/blog) ### [Briser les barrières : les femmes qui ouvrent la voie dans le domaine de la conformité](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr) [+ Read more](https://blog.transworldcompliance.com/fr/briser-les-barrieres-les-femmes-qui-ouvrent-la-voie-dans-le-domaine-de-la-conformite?hsLang=fr)\", summary=\"Danske Bank was involved in a major money laundering scandal, where its Estonian branch allegedly laundered approximately $230 billion in suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015, mainly from Russian clients.

Так, легализация доходов от краж составила ₽120 млрд, от коррупционных преступлений — ₽60 млрд, от преступлений в сфере компьютерной информации — ₽5,2 млрд, а от грабежей — ₽4,6 млрд.

При этом если «красный клиент» не добьется пересмотра решения, обратившись в банк, межведомственную комиссию или суд, то кредитная организация обязана в течение 6 месяцев расторгнуть договор банковского счета (вклада).

Предлагаемый законопроектом механизм изъятия денежных средств во внесудебном порядке «не соответствует Конституции РФ и гражданскому законодательству», говорится в отзыве Счетной палаты. «Согласно статье 35 Конституции РФ никто не может быть лишен своего имущества иначе как по решению суда», - напоминает СП. При этом проект допускает возможность судебного обжалования решение об отнесении клиента к «красной зоне» только после обращения в межведомственную комиссию. Счетная палата предлагает рассмотреть возможность решения таких споров как в административном, так и в судебном порядке, что «в большей степени соответствует конституционным принципам права на защиту», говорится в отзыве. В пояснительной записке к законопроекту отмечается, что доля клиентов высокого риска у банков составляет 0,7%. По данным [ФНС РФ](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%9D%D0%A1_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ФНС РФ\"), на начало 2020 года всего в РФ было зарегистрировано 3,715 млн юрлиц и 4,014 млн индивидуальных предпринимателей.

Впервые в список сомнительных вошли операции, связанные с оборотом цифровой валюты. Кроме того, сомнительными признаны регулярные зачисления средств от третьих лиц с последующим обналичиванием. Из перечня признаков сомнительных операций были исключены нестандартные и необычно сложные инструкции по проведению расчетов, отказ от более выгодных условий оказания услуг и предложение высокой комиссии при оказании услуг. Кроме того, Центробанк теперь не считает сомнительной операцию, когда клиент осуществляет транзакцию через представителя, не вступающего с банком в личный контакт. ### 2020 #### Сокращение объема незаконного обналичивания на 32 млрд рублей Объем незаконного обналичивания средств в российских [банках](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8,_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B8_%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82 \"Финансовые услуги, инвестиции и аудит\") по итогам 2020 года сократился на 32 млрд [рублей](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8C \"Российский рубль\") — до 78 млрд рублей с 110 млрд рублей в 2019-м. Об этом сообщил заместитель председателя правления [ЦБ РФ](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%91_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"ЦБ РФ\") [Дмитрий Скобелкин](/index.php/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0:%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 \"Скобелкин Дмитрий Германович\"). Он назвал этот спад «неплохим показателем», учитывая, что в условиях пандемии коронавируса [[COVID-19] вопрос незаконного обналичивания средств «стоял и стоит достаточно остро». Замглавы Банка [России](/index.php/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Россия\") обратил внимание, что в 2020 году россияне активно снимали наличные деньги, чем пользовались и обнальщики. Однако, как подчеркнул Скобелкин, [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") в целом справились с ситуацией. Объем незаконного обналичивания в 2020 году сократился на 32 млрд рублей По словам Скобелкина, объем сомнительных транзитных операций в банках в 2020 году снизился до 600 млрд рублей со 720 млрд рублей годом ранее. Незаконный вывод денег за рубеж через российские кредитные организации уменьшился на 21,2% — до 52 млрд рублей с 66 млрд рублей. Согласно статистике, которую привел зампред Центробанка, правоохранительные органы возбудили более 20 крупных уголовных дел на основании сообщений, которые банки отправляли в финансовую разведку. Как сообщили в ЦБ РФ, в 2020 году в России зарегистрировано несколько новых схем обналичивания средств. Так, мошенники стали активно использовать схемы с исполнительными листами и с депозитными счетами нотариусов. По данным регулятора, на них пришлось более 40% операций по обналичиванию через счета физлиц. В случае со схемой с исполнительными документами иностранная компания-пустышка взыскивает через суд фиктивный долг с российской фирмы (иногда с заблокированным за сомнительные операции счетом) и тем самым добивается «чистоты» происхождения средств - деньги переводятся не напрямую из компании в компанию, а через службу судебных приставов. В модификации этой схемы, которую стали использовать обнальщики, одной из сторон выступает физлицо. Банки при этом не имеют права препятствовать исполнению решений суда.[[5]](#cite_note-4) #### Принят закон, уточняющий схему работы банков с клиентами в рамках \"антиотмывочных\" норм [Госдума РФ](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%A0%D0%A4 \"Госдума РФ\") в декабре 2020 года приняла закон, который уточняет схему работы банков с клиентами при наличии подозрений, связанных с действием \"антиотмывочного\" законодательства (ФЗ-115). Документ (N948530-7) был внесен в парламент правительством в конце апреля. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | | Как пояснял ранее замминистра финансов Алексей Моисеев, поправки исключают возможность злоупотребления со стороны банков при использовании и отказе в открытии счетов со ссылкой на 115 федеральный закон. \"В частности, предусматривается, что непредставление в кредитную организацию документа, который предназначен для фиксации информации в соответствии с положениями данного закона, не будет являться основанием для принятия решения об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, либо отказе в выполнении распоряжении клиента о совершении операции с денежными средствами или имуществом\", — сказал замминистра. | | Предусматривается информирование клиента об отказе в заключении договора банковского счета, предоставление причины такого отказа, также устанавливается срок для информирования о принятии данного решения: 5 дней. Решение об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета или о его расторжении принимается руководителем кредитной организации или специально уполномоченными им лицами. Сокращается с 10 до 7 дней срок, в течение которого организация обязана сообщить клиенту об устранении оснований, в соответствии с которыми ранее было принято решение об отказе от проведения операции или об отказе от заключения договора банковского счета. #### Власти Чехии арестовали $13 млн, поступившие от российского ИТ-дистрибутора Как стало известно TAdviser, власти [Чехии](/index.php/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Чехия\") по подозрению в отмывании арестовали $13,3 млн, поступившие местной компании Bardet от российского импортера ИТ-оборудования «Техтраст».

Росфинмониторинг отнёс к зонам риска сферы, связанные производством и продажей продукции медицинского назначения, а также распределение бюджетных средств, выделенных государством на поддержку бизнеса и населения. Кроме того, в ведомстве указали на возможное использование схем незаконного обналичивания в условиях в следующих случаях: Росфинмониторинг добавил новые основания для блокировки счетов * создание и расширение инфраструктуры для охраны жизни и здоровья граждан; * онлайн-платформы и услуги, связанные с пандемией; * оборот драгметаллов и драгоценных камней; * вывод денег на счета других фирм перед банкротством юрлиц с целью уклонения от уплаты долгов и налогов; * снижение наличного оборота в отраслях повышенного спроса. По данным федеральной службы, аналогичные риски опубликовала и международная Группа разработки мер по борьбе с отмыванием денег (FATF). В их докладе также упоминается о росте мошенничеств при реализации программ помощи и экономического стимулирования, о махинациях в благотворительной деятельности, а также о возрастании рисков коррупции из фондов чрезвычайных и непредвиденных расходов через обход стандартных процедур закупок.[[7]](#cite_note-6) В группе «[Тинькофф](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F:%D0%A2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%84%D1%84 \"Тинькофф\")» сообщили [«Известиям»](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Известия\"), что одна из сфер, которая сейчас требует повышенного контроля — это мошеннический бизнес в интернете.

В рамках урегулирования дела кредитная организация выплатит штраф на общую сумму более $3 млрд.

Это на 6% больше по сравнению с 2022-м, когда затраты оценивались в $13,52 млрд. Обзор отрасли приводится в материалах Market Research Future, обнародованных в начале сентября 2024 года. Авторы исследования выделяют несколько ключевых факторов, способствующих росту спроса на цифровые решения для борьбы с отмыванием денег. Один из них — технологические достижения, включая внедрение [искусственного интеллекта](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\") и [машинного обучения](/index.php/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5 \"Машинное обучение\"). Эти инструменты позволяют более эффективно выявлять и предотвращать деятельность по отмыванию денег. [ИИ](/index.php/%D0%98%D0%98 \"ИИ\")-алгоритмы способны анализировать огромные массивы данных, выявлять подозрительные закономерности и автоматизировать рутинные процессы. Развитие отрасли также стимулируется благодаря развертыванию облачных решений, обеспечивающих многочисленные преимущества, такие как масштабируемость, более низкая стоимость, гибкое управление рисками, уменьшенное время развертывания и оперативное обновление. Плюс к этому ужесточается контроль над финансовым сектором со стороны регулирующих органов, что требует повышения безопасности.

Рост масштабов авиаконтрабанды связан с тем, что [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\") усилили мониторинг подозрительных транзакций после скандалов с отмыванием денег. Как сообщает газета [The Wall Street Journal](/index.php/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\"), наличные транспортируются на самолетах в обычных чемоданах. В частности, упомянут случай 2020 года, когда из лондонского аэропорта Хитроу в Дубай были перевезены семь чемоданов с деньгами. Их владельцы после прибытия в [ОАЭ](/index.php/%D0%9E%D0%90%D0%AD \"ОАЭ\") задекларировали, что ввозят эквивалент $2,8 млн. Никакие меры в отношении них предприняты не были. [Фото: Unsplash](/index.php/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Convertkit-5SWgIJSsVJo-unsplash.jpg) Через международные аэропорты пассажиры ежегодно провозят сотни миллиардов долларов наличными Объемы авиаконтрабанды растут по нескольким причинам. Одна из них заключается в том, что 3D-сканеры в аэропортах обследуют багаж только на предмет наличия взрывчатых веществ и других потенциально опасных изделий. Большинство аэропортов по всему миру, в том числе в [США](/index.php/%D0%A1%D0%A8%D0%90 \"США\"), не сканируют багаж на наличные деньги, поскольку это весьма затратная процедура с точки зрения оборудования и персонала. Кроме того, некоторые [государства](/index.php/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE \"Государство\") вообще не ограничивают ввоз наличных: в частности, в ОАЭ можно ввезти любую сумму при условии, что она задекларирована. Существующие лазейки, как утверждается, позволяют миллиардам долларов утекать из [Британии](/index.php/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Великобритания\") и других стран в государства с меньшим контролем. Старший следователь Национального агентства по борьбе с преступностью Британии Ян Труби (Ian Truby) говорит, что основной задачей службы безопасности аэропортов является обеспечение безопасности полетов, а не выявление преступлений. А поэтому контрабандная перевозка наличных средств на авиалайнерах набирает обороты. Во многих таких схемах задействованы курьеры, а не сами владельцы денег.[[9]](#cite_note-8) #### В США приговорили к уже отбытому сроку россиянина, обвиняемого в отмывании заработанных на кибератаках денег Обвиняемого в отмывании денег через киберпреступников россиянина Дениса Дубникова суд Портленда (Орегон) приговорил к уже отбытому сроку заключения и штрафу на $10 тыс.

В докладе отмечается, что таких преступлений немного по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денежных средств. Подробнее [здесь](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D1%81_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B9 \"Мошенничество с криптовалютой\"). #### Криптовалюта оказалась не самым популярным способом отмывания краденых денег Несмотря на то, что [криптовалюта](/index.php/%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B0 \"Криптовалюта\") считается очень популярной у [киберпреступников](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Киберпреступников\"), в отмывании средств, похищенных в результате [кибератак](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA \"Кибератак\") на [банки](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8 \"Банки\"), она играет очень незначительную роль. Об этом сообщается в отчете финансовой организации [SWIFT](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:SWIFT \"SWIFT\"), опубликованном в начале сентября 2020 года[[10]](#cite_note-9)[[11]](#cite_note-10). Согласно отчету, случаи отмывания [хакерами](/index.php/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8 \"Хакерами\") похищенных денег через [криптовалюту](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") встречаются очень редко. Количество выявленных случаев отмывания средств через криптовалюту остается сравнительно небольшим по сравнению с суммами, отмываемыми традиционными способами – с помощью «денежных мулов», подставных компаний и инвестиций в другие виды преступной деятельности (наркоторговлю, торговлю людьми и пр.). В качестве примера использования [криптовалюты](/index.php/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8F:%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Криптовалюты в России\") для отмывания денег в отчете SWIFT приведено дело об одной из киберпреступных группировок, занимающихся атаками на банкоматы. Хотя популярным способом отмывания похищенных средств у таких группировок является покупка и перепродажа дорогостоящих товаров, киберпреступники конвертировали похищенную из банкоматов «наличку» в криптовалюту. Еще одним примером является восточноевропейская группировка, запустившая собственную криптоферму в Восточной [Азии](/index.php/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Азия\"). Киберпреступники использовали похищенные у банков средства для финансирования работы криптофермы и генерирования [биткойнов](/index.php/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2 \"Биткойнов\"), которые затем тратились в странах Восточной [Европы](/index.php/%D0%95%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0 \"Европа\"). После ареста участников группировки сотрудники правоохранительных органов обнаружили в доме у их лидера 15 тыс. биткойнов стоимостью $109 млн и ювелирные украшения на общую сумму в $557 тыс., а также два спортивных автомобиля. Криптовалютой для отмывания похищенных средств также пользуется киберпреступная группировка Lazarus, предположительно работающая на северокорейское правительство. Согласно отчету SWIFT, киберпреступники похищают деньги у банков, конвертируют в криптовалюту через множество бирж с целью скрыть их происхождение, а затем снова переводят в реальные деньги и отправляют на счета в [КНДР](/index.php/%D0%9A%D0%9D%D0%94%D0%A0 \"КНДР\"). В редких случаях злоумышленники покупают на похищенные у банков средства предоплаченные криптовалютные карты – физические дебетовые карты, на которых вместо реальных денег можно держать криптовалюту. Снимать средства с таких карт можно через специальные банкоматы, кроме того, их можно использовать для оплаты товаров и услуг. Однако, как подчеркивают эксперты, представленные выше примеры – это, скорее, исключение, чем правило. Такие случаи встречаются очень редко по сравнению с традиционными методами отмывания денег. Тем не менее, по мнению специалистов, в будущем число подобных случаев будет расти. #### Американские адвокаты будут расследовать масштабные случаи отмывания денег в Эстонии [Эстония](/index.php/%D0%AD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F \"Эстония\") заключила договор с действующим в США адвокатским бюро Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP об оказании правовых услуг эстонскому государству по вопросам, связанным с фактами международного отмывания денег[[12]](#cite_note-11).

В 2018-2019 годах [американский](/index.php/%D0%A1%D0%A8%D0%90 \"США\") финансист, владелец Hermitage Capital Билл Браудер подал заявления об отмывании денег через эстонские отделения датского банка Danske Вank и шведского банка Swedbank. Через эстонский филиал датского банка Danske Bank в 2007-2015 годы прошел 201 млрд евро подозрительного происхождения. \"Серые\" сделки связаны с бизнесом клиентов-нерезидентов, прекративших на тот момент свою деятельность. По делу были задержаны 10 бывших сотрудников [Danske Bank](/index.php/Danske_Bank \"Danske Bank\"). Задержанные были, главным образом, менеджерами по работе с клиентами, все они обвиняются в отмывании денег, общая сумма сомнительных транзакций составила около 300 млн евро. По делу были задержаны 10 бывших сотрудников Danske Bank. Задержанные были, главным образом, менеджерами по работе с клиентами, все они обвиняются в отмывании денег, общая сумма сомнительных транзакций составила около 300 млн евро. По словам Браудера, эстонские банковские сотрудники под руководством главы отделения датского банка Айваром Рехе (Aivar Rehe) создали условия для масштабного отмывания денег и скрывали это. 23 сентября 2019 года Рехе покончил с собой. Полиция и прокуратура не сообщили о причинах суицида. По данным издания [The Wall Street Journal](/index.php/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\"), [Центробанк России](/index.php/%D0%A6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8 \"Центробанк России\") еще в 2013 году предупреждал эстонское отделение банка о возможных незаконных перечислениях денег российскими клиентами, но Danske Bank необходимых мер не принял.

Juli 2024 - 22 Minuten Lesezeit **[Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/wie-funktioniert-geldwaesche/)** – ein Begriff, der längst nicht nur in Kriminalromanen auftaucht, sondern reale und tiefgreifende Konsequenzen für Wirtschaftssysteme weltweit darstellt. Insbesondere **Deutschland** hat sich, vielleicht unerwartet für viele, zu einem wahren Hotspot bzw. **Geldwäscheparadies** entwickelt. In diesem Artikel widmen wir uns den zentralen Fragen: **Warum** ist Deutschland zu einem Eldorado für Geldwäsche avanciert? **Wie** schneidet die Bundesrepublik im europäischen Vergleich ab, und **welche** **Folgen** hat das Geldwäscheparadies Deutschland für die Wirtschaft und den Finanzsektor? Die Antworten auf diese Fragen sind vielschichtig und führen uns in die Tiefen des internationalen Finanzwesens, zu Schwachstellen in nationalen Rechtssystemen und den politischen wie ökonomischen Dynamiken, die Deutschland in dieser Rolle festigen. Wir betrachten die **Hintergründe**, die strukturellen Probleme und die Verstrickungen, die Deutschland zur Zieladresse für schmutziges Geld machen. Zudem stellen wir die **Strategien und Maßnahmen** vor, die auf nationaler und europäischer Ebene ergriffen werden, um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzuwirken und zeigen auf, **welche Schritte** noch notwendig sind, um effektive Kontrollmechanismen zu etablieren. Inhalt [Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788086) [Europäischer Vergleich](#t-1722253788087) [Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788088) [Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland](#t-1722253788089) ## Ursachen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### Gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen Deutschland verfügt über **umfangreiche gesetzliche Bestimmungen** zur Bekämpfung der [Geldwäsche](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/phasen-der-geldwaesche/), darunter das [Geldwäschegesetz (GwG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/), die [6 Geldwäscherichtlinien](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html) sowie [§ 261 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__261.html). Trotz dieser Regulatorien gibt es Schwächen in der Umsetzung. Die Verfolgung von Geldwäschefällen hängt stark von der **Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Behörden** wie Polizei, Finanzbehörden und der Justiz ab. Eine häufige Kritik ist, dass es zu lange dauert, bis verdächtige Aktivitäten untersucht und rechtlich verfolgt werden. Zudem fehlen oft klare Vorgaben für die präventive Eindämmung illegaler Vermögensumwandlung in bestimmten Branchen, wie z.B. im Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel. ### Finanzaufsicht und Kontrolle Die [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/pflicht-zur-bestellung-eines-geldwaeschebeauftragten/) in Deutschland steht zunehmend in der Kritik, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die **Zuständigkeiten und die Effizienz der Aufsichtsbehörden**. Während die **Bundesanstalt für Finanz-dienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin)**für den Finanzsektor zuständig ist, liegen die Aufsichtspflichten für andere Bereiche wie z.B. Autohäuser, Immobilienmakler, Juweliere etc. bei den lokalen Aufsichtsbehörden. Dieses System führt zu einem **\"Flickenteppich\"** an undurchsichtigen Zuständigkeiten, was die Wirksamkeit der Geldwäschebekämpfung erheblich beeinträchtigt. Zusätzlich sorgt die **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)**, die zentrale Meldestelle für Verdachtsmeldungen, für massive Kritik. Der FIU wird Fach- und Knowhow-Mangel sowie ein erheblicher Personalmangel vorgeworfen. Dies führt dazu, dass viele Verdachtsmeldungen nicht zeitnah bearbeitet werden können. Die ineffiziente Struktur und mangelnde Ressourcen der FIU schwächen die Geldwäscheprävention und lassen Kriminellen zu viel Spielraum. ### Banken und Finanzdienstleister **Banken und andere Finanzinstitute** sind **Schlüsselakteure** im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Sie sind gesetzlich verpflichtet, Verdachtsmeldungen über fragwürdige Transaktionen abzugeben und interne Kontrollen zur Prävention von Finanzwäsche durchzuführen. Dennoch gibt es immer wieder Fälle, in denen Banken ihrer **Sorgfaltspflicht** nicht nachkommen. Ursachen hierfür sind oft unzureichende interne Kontrollen, mangelnde Schulung des Personals oder bewusstes Ignorieren von Vorschriften. Große Banken sind häufig in Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, was zeigt, dass trotz bestehender Regelungen die praktische Umsetzung mangelhaft ist. ### Hohe Bargeldnutzung Deutschland hat traditionell eine **hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen**. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. Dies führt zu mehreren spezifischen Schwächen: #### **Anonymität der Transaktionen** * Bargeldtransaktionen sind anonym und hinterlassen keine digitalen Spuren, was es den Strafverfolgungsbehörden erschwert, die Herkunft und den Fluss der Gelder nachzuverfolgen. Dies macht Bargeld zu einem bevorzugten Mittel für Kriminelle, die illegale Gelder waschen möchten. #### ****Mangelnde Transparenz**** * Große Bargeldtransaktionen sind weniger transparent als elektronische Transaktionen. Selbst wenn solche Transaktionen gemeldet werden müssen, ist es schwieriger, verdächtige Muster zu erkennen und zu analysieren. Dies führt zu Lücken in der Prüfung und Erkennung von Geldwäscheaktivitäten. #### ******Erschwerte Durchsetzung von Gesetzen****** * Die hohen Bargeldnutzungsraten erschweren die Durchsetzung von Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetzen. Während Banken und andere Finanzinstitute strengen Regulierungen und Meldepflichten unterliegen, sind Bargeldtransaktionen oft weniger reguliert, insbesondere wenn sie außerhalb formaler Finanzinstitute stattfinden. ### Kritische Sektoren: ### ### Immobilien, Kunst- und Auktionshäuser, Autohäuser Bestimmte [Sektoren](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/warnung-vor-neuer-betrugsmasche-fuer-gwg-relevante-haendler/) sind besonders anfällig für Geldwäsche, darunter der **Immobiliensektor, Kunst-** und **Auktionshäuser** sowie **Autohäuser**. Diese Sektoren bieten aufgrund hoher Transaktionssummen und oftmals unzureichender Überwachung ideale Bedingungen für die Umwandlung illegaler Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte. #### **Immobiliensektor** Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt ist besonders anfällig für \"schmutziges\" Geld. **Große Bargeldtransaktionen** und **komplexe Eigentumsstrukturen** machen es schwierig, die Herkunft von Geldern nachzuverfolgen. In Städten wie Berlin, Hamburg und München wird der Immobilienmarkt oft genutzt, um Schwarzgeld zu waschen. Der Erwerb von Luxusimmobilien oder die Investition in Bauprojekte sind gängige Methoden, um illegale Gelder in den legalen Wirtschaftskreislauf einzuschleusen. Seit dem **1. April 2023** gibt es zwar in Deutschland ein **Bargeldverbot beim Immobilienkauf (**[**§ 59 Abs. 11 GwG**](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gwg_2017/__59.html)**)**, um die Finanzwäsche einzudämmen, dennoch bleibt die Umsetzung und Überwachung dieser Regelungen eine Herausforderung. #### **Kunst- und Auktionshäuser** Der Kunst- und Antiquitätenhandel ist ein weiterer Sektor, der anfällig für Geldwäsche ist. Hier **fehlen oft klare Vorgaben und Meldepflichten**, die eine wirksame Überwachung und Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen ermöglichen würden. Es gibt **keine** flächendeckende, verpflichtende **Registrierung** **und Lizenzierung** von Kunst- und Antiquitätenhändlern, was die systematische Überwachung erschwert. Für **Transaktionen über 10.000 Euro** bestehen jedoch **Meldepflichten**, die häufig nicht konsequent umgesetzt werden. Kunsthändler und Auktionshäuser sind verpflichtet, bei hochpreisigen Transaktionen die Herkunft der Gelder und die Identität der Käufer umfassend zu überprüfen und zu dokumentieren. #### **Autohäuser** Autohäuser sind ebenfalls ein kritischer Sektor, da hier **hohe Summen in bar** bezahlt werden können, um illegale Gelder in legale Vermögenswerte umzuwandeln. In Deutschland gilt eine **Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro für Fahrzeugkäufe**. Transaktionen, die diesen Betrag überschreiten, müssen dokumentiert und die am Kauf Beteiligten müssen identifiziert werden. Trotz dieser Regelungen gibt es oft Lücken in der Überwachung und Durchsetzung, was die Kontrolle und Dokumentation solcher Transaktionen erschwert. ### Unternehmen und Steueroasen Viele Unternehmen nutzen **komplexe Firmenstrukturen**, darunter auch Briefkastenfirmen bzw. allgemein Offshore-Konstrukte, um Geldwäsche zu betreiben. **Offshore-Konstrukte** sind rechtliche und finanzielle Strukturen, die in Ländern oder Gebieten mit günstigen Steuer- und Regulierungsgesetzen (z.B. Bulgarien, Luxemburg, Schweiz, Malta...) eingerichtet werden. Diese Gebiete werden oft als Steueroasen bezeichnet. Solche Konstrukte beinhalten häufig die **Gründung von****Briefkastenfirmen oder Tochtergesellschaften**, die hauptsächlich dazu dienen, steuerliche Vorteile zu nutzen und die Herkunft von Geldern zu verschleiern. Diese Strukturen erschweren die Nachverfolgung illegaler Gelder erheblich. Deutschland hat zwar Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Nutzung solcher Konstrukte zu bekämpfen, jedoch bleiben internationale Verflechtungen ein großes Hindernis. Steueroasen bieten weiterhin **Schlupflöcher für Unternehmen**, die illegale Gelder verstecken oder waschen möchten. Die Transparenz und Offenlegung von Unternehmensstrukturen ist daher ein zentraler Punkt im Kampf gegen Geldwäsche. Um Geldwäsche in Deutschland effektiv zu bekämpfen, müssen die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen kontinuierlich verbessert werden. Eine stärkere internationale Zusammenarbeit und gezielte Maßnahmen zur Überwachung der kritischen Branchen und der Finanzinstitute sind unerlässlich. Nur durch eine umfassende und koordinierte Strategie kann die Geldwäsche nachhaltig eingedämmt werden. **Schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen vor **Geldwäsche-Risiken**!** Fordern Sie noch heute Ihre kostenlose Erstberatung an und profitieren Sie von unserer langjährigen Expertise im Bereich der Geldwäscheprävention. [Jetzt Beratungsgespräch sichern](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/anfrage/) ## Europäischer Vergleich Die **Gesetzgebung** zur Bannung der Geldwäsche **variiert in Europa erheblich**. Während einige Länder strenge Regulierungen und effektive Durchsetzungsmechanismen implementiert haben, stehen andere noch vor massiven Herausforderungen. In diesem Abschnitt vergleichen wir die Ansätze mehrerer europäischer Länder und analysieren, wie **Deutschland im Vergleich** abschneidet. ### **Länder mit besonders zielführenden Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche** **Die Niederlande** gelten als Vorreiter in der Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche. Sie haben ein zentrales Meldesystem für verdächtige Transaktionen, das von der Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-NL) verwaltet wird. Dieses System ermöglicht eine schnelle Erkennung und Verfolgung dubioser Aktivitäten. Die enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden trägt maßgeblich zum Erfolg bei. * Zentrales Meldesystem, enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Banken und Behörden * Trotz strenger Regulierungen Probleme bei der Abwehr grenzüberschreitender Geldwäsche **Frankreich** hat ebenfalls umfangreiche Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung der Geldwäsche eingeführt. Die französische Finanzaufsichtsbehörde, Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), und Tracfin, eine spezielle Einheit zum Kampf gegen Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung, überwachen und regulieren Finanztransaktionen streng. Frankreich ist bekannt für seine konsequente Strafverfolgung und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von EU-Richtlinien zur Geldwäschereduzierung. * Strenge Kontrolle und konsequente Umsetzung der EU-Richtlinien * Komplikationen bei der Beaufsichtigung von [Kryptowährungen](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/kryptowaehrungen-und-geldwaeschepraevention/) und neuen Finanztechnologien **Das Vereinigte Königreich** hat einige der strengsten Anti-Geldwäsche-Gesetze in Europa. Die National Crime Agency (NCA) und die Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) spielen eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Überwachung und Durchsetzung. Großbritannien hat strenge Meldepflichten und umfassende Maßnahmen zur Überprüfung und Verifizierung von Kundenidentitäten eingeführt. * Strenge Gesetze und rigorose Nachverfolgung durch NCA und FCA * London als globales Finanzzentrum bleibt Hotspot für Geldwäscheaktivitäten ### **Länder mit großen Herausforderungen bei der Geldwäschebekämpfung** **Deutschland** hat, wie bereits oben erwähnt, in den letzten Jahren seine Gesetze zur Abwehr der Geldwäsche verschärft. Trotz dieser Fortschritte wird Deutschland oft kritisiert. Die FIU wird bzgl. Fach-, Knowhow- und Personalmangel bemängelt. Ebenso die Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) steht aufgrund begrenzter Ressourcen und komplexer Finanzströme vor einigen Hürden. Insbesondere in den bereits genannten Sektoren und bei der Beobachtung von Nichtfinanzunternehmen (\"Flickenteppich\") herrscht Ineffizienz der Behörden. Zudem hat Deutschland traditionell eine hohe Präferenz für Bargeldzahlungen. Diese Kultur der Barzahlung bietet zahlreiche Vorteile für Geldwäscher, da Bargeldtransaktionen schwerer zu verfolgen sind als elektronische Transaktionen. * Umfassende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen * Ineffizienz der Behörden, Personalmangel, allg. hohe Bargeldnutzung Obwohl die **Schweiz** kein EU-Mitglied ist, spielt sie eine bedeutende Rolle im europäischen Finanzsystem. Die Schweiz hat in den letzten Jahren ihre Gesetze zum Widerstand gegen Geldwäsche verschärft und arbeitet eng mit internationalen Organisationen zusammen. Die Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA) überwacht Finanzinstitute und sorgt für die Einhaltung der Anti-Geldwäsche-Vorschriften. Die Schweiz bleibt jedoch aufgrund ihrer Bankgeheimnisse, attraktiven Steuerregelungen und ihrer sogenannten Zollfreigrenzen ein Hotspot für illegale Geldströme. * Enge Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen Organisationen und verschärfte Gesetze * Bankgeheimnis, attraktive Steuerregelungen und Zollfreigrenzen fördern Geldwäsche **Italien** hat mit erheblichen Hindernissen im Bereich der Geldwäsche zu kämpfen, insbesondere durch die Präsenz der Mafia und anderer krimineller Organisationen. Die italienische Regierung hat eine Vielzahl von Gesetzen und Regulierungen eingeführt, um Geldwäsche zu bekämpfen, darunter die Einrichtung der Anti-Mafia-Direktion (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, DIA). Trotz dieser Maßnahmen bleibt die konsequente Umsetzung ein ständiges Problem. * Einrichtung spezialisierter Anti-Mafia-Einheiten * Starke Präsenz der Mafia und ineffektive Umsetzung von Gesetzen ### **Fazit des Vergleichs** Ein Vergleich der europäischen Länder zeigt, dass **jedes Land gewisse Stärke und Schwächen** bei der Geldwäschebeseitigung aufweist, aber Staaten wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich und das Vereinigte Königreich** insgesamt **sehr erfolgreiche Maßnahmen** zur Geldwäscheneutralisierung implementiert haben. Diese Länder setzen auf enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Behörden und Finanzinstituten, strenge Regulierungen und beharrliche Strafverfolgung.Länder wie die **Schweiz und Italien** hingegen stehen hier vor **enormeren Stolpersteinen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter verbessern, um Geldwäsche entgegenzuwirken. **Deutschland** zeigt durch die stetige Verschärfung der gesetzlichen Regularien zwar einen **guten Ansatz**, muss jedoch ebenso seine Maßnahmen optimieren, insbesondere im Bereich der personellen Ausstattung und der Inspektion der kritischen Sektoren. ## Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche hat **erhebliche wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen für Deutschland**. Durch das Einfließen von illegalem Geld in die Wirtschaft werden Marktmechanismen verzerrt. Investitionen in Immobilien, Kunst und Luxusgüter mit illegalen Geldern können die Preise in diesen Märkten künstlich in die Höhe treiben. Dies kann zu einer Blase führen, die bei ihrem Platzen erhebliche **wirtschaftliche Schäden** verursachen kann. Außerdem **entgehen dem Staat** durch Geldwäsche **erhebliche Steuereinnahmen**, die sonst für öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Infrastrukturprojekte verwendet werden könnten. ### **Soziale und politische Auswirkungen** Geldwäsche **untergräbt das Vertrauen der Bürger in staatliche Institutionen und den Finanzsektor**. Wenn illegale Aktivitäten ungestraft bleiben, entsteht der Eindruck, dass Kriminalität nicht effektiv bekämpft wird und dass Gesetze nicht für alle gleichermaßen gelten. Dies kann zu sozialem Unmut und einem Rückgang der gesellschaftlichen Moral führen. Politisch kann dies Druck auf die Regierung ausüben, strengere Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, was wiederum die **politische Stabilität** beeinflussen kann. ### **Rechtliche Folgen** Die **rechtlichen Konsequenzen** illegaler Geldtransaktionen sind **weitreichend**. Individuen und Unternehmen, die der Geldwäsche überführt werden, sehen sich erheblichen Strafen gegenüber, einschließlich **hoher Geldstrafen** und **langjährigen Gefängnisstrafen**. Darüber hinaus können Unternehmen ihre **Geschäftslizenzen verlieren**, was ihre Fähigkeit, international zu operieren, stark einschränkt. Prominente Fälle zeigen, dass die Justiz zunehmend härter gegen Geldwäscher vorgeht. ### **Internationale Reputation** Geldwäsche hat auch starke **Auswirkungen auf die** **internationale Reputation Deutschlands**. Wenn ein Land als „Geldwäscheparadies“ angesehen wird, kann dies das **Vertrauen** **internationaler Investoren und Geschäftspartner****beeinträchtigen**. Internationale Organisationen wie die Financial Action Task Force (FATF) bewerten die Effektivität der Geldwäschebannung in verschiedenen Ländern. Negative Bewertungen können dazu führen, dass Deutschland **unter erhöhter Beobachtung** steht und möglicherweise **internationalen Druck** zur Verschärfung seiner Gesetze und Maßnahmen erfährt. Die Konsequenzen der Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind somit vielschichtig und betreffen verschiedene Bereiche der Gesellschaft. Wirtschaftliche Verzerrungen, sozialer und politischer Vertrauensverlust, rechtliche Strafen und die Beeinträchtigung der internationalen Reputation sind nur einige der gravierenden Auswirkungen. Um diesen negativen Folgen entgegenzuwirken, ist eine verstärkte und koordinierte Anstrengung zur Vorbeugung von Geldwäsche notwendig. ## Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche in Deutschland ### **Gesetzliche Reformen** Eine der wichtigsten Maßnahmen zur Entgegenwirkung der Geldwäsche ist die **kontinuierliche Verbesserung** der gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Deutschland hat diese bereits durch das GwG, die [GwG-Richtlinien](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/vierte-eu-geldwaescherichtlinie/) und den **§ 261 des StGBs verschärft**, aber es gibt weiterhin Raum für Verbesserungen. Regelmäßige **Überprüfungen und Anpassungen der Gesetze** sind notwendig, um auf neue Geldwäschemethoden zu reagieren. Zudem sollten härtere Strafen für Verstöße und eine bessere Ausstattung der Strafverfolgungsbehörden implementiert werden. #### **Ergänzung: EU-Gesetzespaket** Nach intensiven Verhandlungen und Abstimmungen wurde das [**AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**](https://www.hilfssheriff.de/eu-gesetzespaket-die-umsetzungsfrist-laeuft/) nun offiziell im Amtsblatt veröffentlicht. Dieses umfassende Regelwerk besteht aus drei wesentlichen und detaillierten Rechtsakten: **Die AMLA-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1620)** Die[**AMLA-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401620) etabliert die **neue EU-Behörde für die Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung (AMLA)**. Diese Behörde wird in Frankfurt am Main ansässig sein und **ab Mitte 2024** ihre Tätigkeit aufnehmen. Ihre Hauptaufgaben umfassen die direkte und indirekte Aufsicht über Verpflichtete im Finanzsektor, die einem hohen Risiko der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung ausgesetzt sind. **Die Geldwäsche-Verordnung (Verordnung (EU) 2024/1624)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Verordnung**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401624) zielt darauf ab, die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für **Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung** zu verhindern. Sie tritt am **10. Juli 2027** in Kraft, mit spezifischen Ausnahmen für **Fußballagenten und Profifußballvereine**, die bis zum **10. Juli 2029** Zeit haben, die notwendigen Anpassungen vorzunehmen. **Einführung einer EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** Ein weiter wichtiger Bestandteil der **Geldwäsche-Verordnung** ist die **Einführung** einer **EU-weiten Bargeldobergrenze** in Höhe von **10.000 Euro**. Diese Regelung gilt für Barzahlungen zwischen Unternehmen sowie zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern, **nicht jedoch für Transaktionen zwischen Privatpersonen**. EU-Mitgliedstaaten haben die Option, eine niedrigere Obergrenze festzulegen. Die Regelung tritt voraussichtlich **Mitte 2026** in Kraft und stellt besonders für Länder wie Deutschland, die bisher keine Bargeldobergrenze hatten, eine bedeutende Änderung dar. In Deutschland existiert bisher keine generelle Obergrenze für Bargeldzahlungen. Allerdings muss sich der Käufer bei Bargeldzahlungen über 10.000 Euro ausweisen und die Herkunft des Geldes nachweisen. Der Händler ist verpflichtet, diese Informationen zu dokumentieren und aufzubewahren. **Die Geldwäsche-Richtlinie (Richtlinie (EU) 2024/1640)** Die [**Geldwäsche-Richtlinie**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202401640) legt die **Mechanismen** fest, die von den Mitgliedstaaten zur Verhinderung der Nutzung des Finanzsystems für Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung umgesetzt werden müssen. Sie **gilt nicht unmittelbar in den Mitgliedstaaten**, sondern muss in nationales Recht umgesetzt werden. Die Frist für die meisten Vorgaben ist der **10. Juli 2027**. Diese neuen Regelungen, einschließlich der Bargeldobergrenze, stellen einen bedeutenden Schritt in den Bemühungen der EU dar, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung effektiv zu bekämpfen und die Integrität des Finanzsystems zu gewährleisten. ### **Stärkung der Finanzaufsicht** Die **BaFin, FIU** bzw. allgemein die **deutschen Aufsichtsbehörden** spielen eine **zentrale Rolle** bei der **Beseitigung der Geldwäsche**. Um ihre Effektivität zu steigern, müssen die **personellen und technischen Ressourcen** sowie das **Fachwissen** erweitert werden. Dies umfasst z.B. die Einstellung zusätzlicher Experten und die Einführung moderner Analysetools zum Monitoring verdächtiger Transaktionen. Eine bessere internationale Zusammenarbeit und der Austausch von Informationen mit anderen Behörden können ebenfalls die Effizienz bei der Geldwäscheeindämmung erhöhen. ### **Technologische Lösungen** Zwar bringt der Einsatz von **Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI)** natürlich einerseits neue große Herausforderungen (z.B. gefälschte Ausweisdokumente, Deepfakes) mit sich, andererseits kann der **Einsatz moderner Technologie** die Geldwäscheeindämmung hingegen fördern. KI und maschinelles Lernen bieten **neue Möglichkeiten** zur **Erkennung und Analyse von Mustern**, die auf illegale Finanzströme hinweisen. Diese Technologien können große Datenmengen in Echtzeit überwachen und verdächtige Aktivitäten schneller und präziser identifizieren als herkömmliche Methoden. Darüber hinaus können **Blockchain-Technologien** zur Nachverfolgung von Transaktionen und zur Erhöhung der Transparenz im Finanzsektor beitragen. ### **Internationale Kooperation** Geldwäsche ist ein globales Problem, das eine internationale Zusammenarbeit erfordert. **Gemeinsame Initiativen** und der **Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices** sind entscheidend, um grenzüberschreitende Geldwäsche zielführend zu bekämpfen. Die Teilnahme an internationalen Taskforces und die Unterstützung globaler Standards zur [Geldwäscheprävention](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaeschebeauftragter-aufgaben-rechte-pflichten-risiken/) sind von größter Wichtigkeit. Das bereits beschlossene **EU GwG-Paket**sowie die Schaffung einer **EU einheitlichen****zentralen Anti-Geldwäsche Behörde**stellt hier einen wichtigen Schritt bei der Entgegenwirkung illegaler Finanzabwicklungen dar. ### **Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Sensibilisierung** Ein oft vernachlässigter Aspekt der Geldwäscheabwehr ist die **Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit** und die Förderung eines besseren Verständnisses für die Risiken und Folgen von Geldwäsche. Durch gezielte **Aufklärungskampagnen** sowie [**(Mitarbeiter-)Schulungen**](https://exkulpa.de/geldwaeschepraevention/geldwaesche-schulung-mitarbeiter/) können Bürger und Unternehmen über die Anzeichen und Meldemöglichkeiten von Geldwäsche informiert werden. Dies erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass verdächtige Aktivitäten erkannt und gemeldet werden. Diese Maßnahmen sind **zentrale Bausteine** einer erfolgreichen Strategie. Nur durch die Kombination dieser Ansätze kann Deutschland den Kraftakt der Geldwäschereduzierung meistern und seine Wirtschaft, Unternehmen sowie seine Verbraucher schützen. **Geldwäscheprävention** leicht gemacht: **Online-Schulung** für Ihr Team Unsere Online-Geldwäschepräventionsschulung bietet Mitarbeitern die Kenntnisse, die sie benötigen, um Geldwäsche zu erkennen und zu verhindern, gemäß den gesetzlichen Anforderungen.

[Jetzt Team anmelden](https://exkulpa.de/akademie/gwg-schulung-fuer-mitarbeiter/) ## Fallbeispiele Im Folgenden noch einige**Skandalbeispielfälle** von Geldwäsche, in die unter anderem **europäische Länder** verwickelt waren: ### **Fallbeispiel: Deutsche Bank** Die **Deutsche Bank** ist mehrfach wegen ihrer Verwicklung in Geldwäscheskandale in die Schlagzeilen geraten. Ein prominenter Fall ist die **Beteiligung** an einem riesigen Geldwäsche-Schema, das als **\"Russischer Spiegelhandel\"** bekannt ist. Zwischen 2011 und 2015 wurden über die Moskauer, Londoner und New Yorker Niederlassungen der Deutschen Bank etwa **10 Milliarden Dollar** gewaschen. Die Bank musste wegen unzureichender Kontrollmechanismen **Strafen** in Höhe von **630 Millionen Dollar** an die US- und britischen Behörden zahlen. ### **Fallbeispiel: Danske Bank** Die **Danske Bank** war in einen der **größten Geldwäscheskandale Europas** verwickelt. Über die estnische Niederlassung der Bank wurden zwischen 2007 und 2015 rund **200 Milliarden Euro** verdächtiger Gelder, hauptsächlich aus Russland, Aserbaidschan und der Ukraine, gewaschen. Der Skandal führte zu einem massiven Verlust an Vertrauen und einer erheblichen Belastung des Rufs der Bank. Die dänischen und estnischen Behörden sowie internationale Regulierungsbehörden führten umfassende Untersuchungen durch, was zu **hohen Geldstrafen und einem Rücktritt des CEO** führte. ### **Fallbeispiel: 1MDB-Skandal** Der **1MDB-Skandal** ist ein **globales Beispiel** für weitreichende Geldwäsche und Korruption. Der malaysische Staatsfonds 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) war in einen massiven Geldwäscheskandal verwickelt, bei dem **Milliarden von Dollar** durch ein komplexes Netzwerk von **Offshore-Konten und Scheinfirmen** gewaschen wurden. Banken in der Schweiz, Singapur und den USA waren beteiligt. In Deutschland spielte die Deutsche Bank erneut eine Rolle, indem sie Transaktionen im Zusammenhang mit 1MDB abgewickelt hat. Der Skandal führte zu **weltweiten Ermittlungen und zahlreichen Verhaftungen**. ### **Fallbeispiel: Wirecard** Der **Wirecard-Skandal** ist ein jüngeres Beispiel für umfassende Finanzkriminalität und Geldwäsche in Deutschland. Das Unternehmen Wirecard, ein Zahlungsdienstleister, war in betrügerische Aktivitäten verwickelt, bei denen angebliche Vermögenswerte in Höhe von **1,9 Milliarden Euro** fehlten. Die Geldwäscheaspekte des Skandals betreffen die komplexen internationalen Transaktionen und das Verschwinden großer Geldsummen durch **Briefkastenfirmen** in verschiedenen Ländern. Der Skandal führte zu einer **umfangreichen Untersuchung** durch deutsche und internationale Behörden und dem **Zusammenbruch des Unternehmens**. ### **Fallbeispiel: HSBC** Die **britische Bank HSBC** war in mehrere Geldwäscheskandale verwickelt, darunter die Bereitstellung von Finanzdienstleistungen für Drogenkartelle in Mexiko und Kolumbien. Zwischen 2006 und 2010 wusch HSBC schätzungsweise **881 Millionen Dollar** an Drogengeldern. Die Bank gestand Versäumnisse bei der Geldwäscheprävention ein und zahlte **1,9 Milliarden Dollar an Strafen** im Rahmen eines Vergleichs mit den US-Behörden. Dieser Fall zeigte die globalen Dimensionen von Geldwäsche und die Notwendigkeit strengerer Kontrollen bei internationalen Banken. Diese Fallstudien verdeutlichen die **vielfältigen Methoden** und **enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche in Europa und weltweit**. Sie zeigen, wie leicht Finanzinstitute in illegale Aktivitäten verstrickt werden können und welche gravierenden Folgen dies für die beteiligten Unternehmen und die globale Wirtschaft hat. Durch die Untersuchung dieser Fälle können wichtige Lehren für die Verbesserung der Geldwäscheprävention und -bekämpfung gezogen werden. ## Fazit **Geldwäsche** bleibt ein **erhebliches Problem** in Deutschland und weltweit. Trotz bestehender Gesetze und Regulierungen gibt es zahlreiche Schwächen und Hürden bei der Gegenwehr. Die **Ursachen** für Geldwäsche in Deutschland sind vielfältig, darunter **gesetzliche Lücken**, **unzureichende Aufsicht**, die **Rolle von Banken und Finanzdienstleistern**, die **kritischen Sektoren** und die Nutzung **komplexer Firmenstrukturen** sowie **Steueroasen**. Ein **europäischer Vergleich** zeigt, dass Länder wie die **Niederlande, Frankreich** und **das** **Vereinigte Königreich** besonders **fruchtbare Maßnahmen** zur Eindämmung der Geldwäsche eingeführt haben. Im Gegensatz dazu stehen **Deutschland, die Schweiz** und **Italien**vor **umfangreicheren Komplikationen** und müssen ihre Maßnahmen weiter optimieren. Die **Konsequenzen** der Geldwäsche sind weitreichend, einschließlich **wirtschaftlicher Verzerrungen**, **sozialem** und **politischem Vertrauensverlust**, **rechtlichen Strafen** und **Beeinträchtigungen** der internationalen **Reputation**. Fallbeispiele wie die Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, 1MDB, Wirecard und HSBC illustrieren die vielfältigen Methoden und enormen Dimensionen der Geldwäsche. Die **Abwehr** der Geldwäsche erfordert **kontinuierliche Anpassungen und Verbesserungen**. Neue Technologien und komplexere Finanzströme stellen laufend neue Schwierigkeiten dar. Deutschland muss weiterhin seine gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Kontrollmechanismen verbessern, um mit den sich wandelnden Methoden der Geldwäsche Schritt zu halten. Ein wichtiger Schritt in diese Richtung ist das kürzlich verabschiedete **AML-Gesetzespaket der EU**, das unter anderem eine **EU-weite Bargeldobergrenze von 10.000 Euro** einführt. Diese Maßnahme zielt darauf ab, die Transparenz bei größeren Finanztransaktionen zu erhöhen und die Nutzung des Finanzsystems für illegale Aktivitäten zu erschweren. Ein verstärkter Fokus auf die internationale Zusammenarbeit ist unerlässlich. Nur durch gemeinsame Anstrengungen und den Austausch von Informationen und Best Practices kann Geldwäsche konsequent entgegengewirkt werden. Die Integration **moderner Technologien** wie Künstlicher Intelligenz und **Blockchain** kann ebenfalls dazu beitragen, die Erkennung und Verfolgung von illegalen Finanzströmen zu verbessern.

Это одно из самых масштабных преступлений, с которыми мировая экономика имеет дело столетиями. Finance.ua расскажет о самых резонансных случаях и схемах отмывания денег в мире за последние годы. Оглавление 1. [Что такое отмывание денег](#headline_1) 2. [«Панамские документы»](#headline_4) 3. [«Райские документы»](#headline_8) 4. [Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank](#headline_10) 5. [Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом](#headline_13) 6. [Liberty Reserve](#headline_15) Finance UA Обновлено 11 июля 2024 Отмывание денег имеет серьезные далеко идущие негативные последствия для экономики, общества и целостности финансовой системы. Это уже давно глобальная проблема, которая угрожает финансовым системам и способствует росту преступной деятельности. По данным МВФ, уровень отмывания денег составляет 2−5% мирового ВВП. В причастности к таким действиям в последние годы были уличены известные банки, политики, знаменитости и компании. ## Что такое отмывание денег Прежде всего, разберемся подробнее, что означает отмывание денег. Это преступление, связанное с сокрытием или попыткой скрыть незаконное происхождение полученных средств. В рамках этого процесса человек или учреждение превращает незаконные средства в законные через сложные каналы. Деньги проходят различные этапы, включая конвертацию и перевод в официально признанное учреждение. Например, человек получил деньги путем преступной деятельности (мошенничество, торговля наркотиками, контрабанда оружия, терроризм и т. п.), а затем вливает эти средства на официальный рынок. Как это он делает? Покупает недвижимость, транспортные средства, компании и т. д., таким образом превращая их происхождение в законное. Тот, кто отмывает деньги, обходит финансовую систему страны и манипулирует ею, чтобы вводить и тратить неправомерно полученные деньги. Рассмотрим 5 громких историй с отмыванием денег, которые стали известны в последние годы и получили международный резонанс. ## «Панамские документы» Утечка «Панамских документов» (Panama Papers) в 2016 году стала монументальным разоблачением, которое обнародовало многочисленные резонансные случаи отмывания денег, уклонение от уплаты налогов и обход международных санкций. Утечка информации касалась банков, юридических фирм и чиновников во всем мире, раскрывая масштабы незаконной финансовой деятельности, скрытой через оффшорные банки и подставные компании. «Панамские документы» — это история с утечкой зашифрованных конфиденциальных документов, которые были собственностью панамской юридической фирмы Mossack Fonseca, специализирующейся на работе с оффшорами. Эти документы в апреле 2016 года опубликовала немецкая газета Süddeutsche Zeitung, назвав их «панамскими документами». Таким образом удалось разоблачить сеть из более 214 тыс. налоговых гаваней, в которые были привлечены люди и организации из 200 разных стран. В центре этих историй стоит Mossack Fonseca — панамский поставщик оффшорных компаний с десятками офисов по всему миру. Компания продает свои оболочки фирм в таких городах как Цюрих, Лондон и Гонконг. Mossack Fonseca является посредником для тех, кто хочет зарегистрировать компанию в «налоговом раю» и пользоваться льготами. Mossack Fonseca тесно сотрудничала с такими финансовыми гигантами как HSBC, Deutsche Bank и Credit Suisse, чтобы помочь их клиентам скрыть свои средства. Так, клиенты Mossack Fonseca могли приобрести анонимную компанию всего за 1 тыс. долларов. Но за эту цену можно получить просто пустую оболочку. За дополнительную плату Mossack Fonseca предоставляла фиктивного директора и при желании скрывала настоящего акционера компании. В результате возникает оффшорная компания, чья подлинная цель и структура собственности зашифрована извне. ### Кто из известных людей «засветился» в «Панамских документах»? **Бывший премьер-министр Исландии Сигмундюр Гюннлейгссон** Как выяснили журналисты, Гюннлейгссон прятал миллионы долларов инвестиций исландских банков в оффшорных компаниях. Согласно документам, Гюннлейгссон и его жена купили оффшорную компанию Wintris в 2007 году, однако не указали ее в декларации. В 2010 году исландский премьер продал 50% компании Wintris своей жене за 1 доллар. **Бывший премьер-министр Грузии Бидзина Иванишвили** Иванишвили скрыл от налоговой тот факт, что владеет компанией Lynden Management Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах, не зафиксировав ее ни в одной декларации. Через эту компанию Иванишвили и его партнеры контролировали около 20% акций американской фармацевтической компании Raptor Pharmaceuticals. **Бывший премьер-министр Иордании Али Абу Рагеб** Журналисты обнаружили, что за несколько месяцев до истечения своего срока в должности премьера Рагеб зарегистрировал оффшорную компанию Jaar Investment Ltd, открывшую счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. Кроме того, политик вместе с супругой стал директором Jay Investment Holdings Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. До декабря 2014 года Рагебу принадлежали три компании на Сейшельских островах, а его дети были привлечены как директора в нескольких других компаниях, в частности Desert Star Investment Capital Ltd, которая имела счета в Arab Bank в Женеве. **Бывший вице-президент Ирака Ияд Аллави** Согласно расследованию, в 1985 году Аллави зарегистрировал через Mossack Fonseca компанию I.M.F. Holdings Inc. В 2013 году общая стоимость ее активов составила 1,5 млрд долларов. Еще одна компания, которую Аллави не указал в своей декларации — Moonlight Estates Limited. **Отец бывшего премьер-министра Великобритании Дэвида Кэмерона** Покойный отец бывшего британского премьера Дэвида Кэмерон Иен Кэмерон помогал создать и развивать оффшорную компанию Blairmore Holdings Inc в 1982 году и был вовлечен в ее деятельность вплоть до своей смерти в 2010-м. В 1998 году Blairmore была оценена в 20 млн долларов. **Президент Азербайджана Ильхам Алиев** Алиев и его супруга в 2003 году купили компанию Rosamund International Ltd на Британских Виргинских островах. Тогда Алиев был депутатом парламента, а позже вступил в должность президента. Следовательно, политик, указанный директором и совладельцем Rosamund International Ltd, нарушил закон, запрещающий президенту заниматься бизнесом. В 2008 году две дочери Алиева приобрели компании Arbor Investments, LaBelleza Holdings Limited и Harvard Management Limited. Директором этих трех фирм оказался предприниматель Хасан Гозал. Он вместе со своим братом Абдолбары владел десятью компаниями, входящими в холдинг Intersun, где Абдолбары был президентом, а Хассан — вице-президентом. Таким образом, холдинг Intersun получил несколько крупных контрактов от государственной нефтяной компании Азербайджана, где Алиев еще до главы государства был первым вице-президентом. **Король Саудовской Аравии Салман ибн Абдул-Азиз Аль Сауд** Согласно «Панамским архивам», через оффшорные компании король Саудовской Аравии владел яхтой и недвижимостью в Лондоне, которую оценили в 34 млн долларов. На имя монарха зарегистрирован ряд компаний, в том числе Safason Corporation SA SPF, Verse Development Corporation, InRow Corporation, Crassus Limited и Park Property Limited. **Футболист Лионель Месси** Согласно обнародованным данным, Месси и его отцу принадлежит оффшорная компания Mega Star Enterprises, зарегистрированная в Панаме. Впервые она была упомянута в архивах Mossack Fonseca еще 13 июня 2013 года. На следующий день испанская прокуратура выдвинула против обеих Месси обвинения в многомиллионных налоговых махинациях. **Ближайшее окружение российского диктатора владимира путина** В «Панамских архивах» были упомянуты четыре компании, связанные с россией — Sonnette Overseas, International Media Overseas, Sunbarn и Sandalwood Continental. Все они были зарегистрированы в оффшорах через Mossack Fonseca и связаны с окружением путина. Так, International Media Overseas и Sonnette Overseas принадлежали близкому другу диктатора россии виолончелисту Сергею Ролдугину. В расследовании также упоминаются оффшорные компании спикера диктатора рф Дмитрия пескова, министра экономического развития Алексея Улюкаева, сына российского олигарха и друга путина Игоря Ротенберга, и других российских политиков. Выведенная ими в оффшоры сумма на 2016 год могла достигать 2 млрд долларов. ## «Райские документы» В ноябре 2017 года журналисты Международного консорциума журналистских расследований (ICIJ) обнародовали данные тайных документов о налоговых лазейках и бизнес-контактах чиновников из 50 стран мира, в том числе и Украины. Эта утечка получила название «Райские документы» (Paradise Papers) и содержала данные госреестров полутора десятков экзотических островов, где регистрируют оффшорные компании. Речь идет о 13,4 млн финансовых документов с данными о том, как богатейшие люди и компании мира тайно вкладывают деньги в оффшорные зоны, чтобы «защититься» от налогов или сохранить секретность деловых соглашений. В материалах, охватывающих период с 1950-го по 2016 год, фигурируют имена более 120 мировых политиков. Среди самых громких имен в документах — покойная королева Великобритании Елизавета II, а также корпорации, такие как Nike, Apple и Facebook. Большая часть материала, а именно 6,8 млн документов, касается деятельности юридической фирмы Appleby, действовавшей в 10 различных юрисдикциях. Но в другой части речь идет об оффшорах корпораций, спортсменов и политиков во всем мире. **Королева Британии Елизавета II** По данным из «Райских документов», около 10 млн фунтов стерлингов из частного состояния королевы Елизаветы II были инвестированы в оффшоры. Деньги в фонды на Каймановых островах и Бермудах вкладывало Герцогство Ланкастерское, что обеспечивало королеву доходами и управляло инвестициями в пределах ее частной собственности в 500 млн фунтов стерлингов. **российский предприниматель Юрий Мильнер** «Райские документы» обнаружили «кремлевский след» в компаниях Facebook Inc. и Twitter Inc. По данным расследователей, один из важных инвесторов обеих компаний — фонд DST Global, принадлежащий российскому миллиардеру Юрию Мильнеру, был финансово связан с российскими госкомпаниями. Так, на деньги, полученные от ВТБ Банка, фонд Мильнера приобрел в 2011 году акции Twitter. Инвестиции же в Facebook фонда DST Global фактически профинансировала дочерняя компания «Газпрома» — «Газпром инвестхолдинг», которую возглавлял тогда бизнесмен Алишер Усманов. Мильнер и партнеры продали свои акции Facebook и Twitter в 2012 и 2013 годах. **Бывший министр торговли США Уилбур Росс** По данным документов, бывший американский министр через серию оффшоров имел долю в компании Navigator, тесно сотрудничавшей с газовой компанией Sibur. Совладельцем Sibur был муж дочери путина. **Apple** Благодаря некоторым особенностям законодательства в оффшорах Apple несколько лет не платила миллиарды налогов. В частности, до 2014 года компания использовала лазейку в налоговом законодательстве США и Ирландии, известную как double Irish. Это схема оптимизации налоговых обязательств посредством использования двух ирландских и одной нидерландской компаний. Она позволила Apple постоянно производить продажу за пределами Северной и Южной Америки — а это почти 55% дохода — через ирландские дочерние компании, которые фактически были оффшорами. Таким образом, компания не платила никаких налогов. **Nike** Компания снижала налоговые ставки через свой филиал в Нидерландах. Схема работала таким образом: когда человек покупал товар, например, в Лондоне, то деньги за него уходили в главную британскую дочернюю компанию Nike. Затем денежные средства поступали в Нидерланды, где расположена штаб-квартира компании. В течение 2005−2014 годов компания могла перечислять деньги оттуда на Бермуды, где зарегистрирована ее «дочка» — Nike International Ltd. ## Скандал с отмыванием денег Danske Bank Крупнейший банк Дании Danske Bank был замешан в масштабном скандале с отмыванием денег, связанном с подозрительными транзакциями примерно на 200 млрд евро через эстонский филиал. Скандал возник в 2018 году после раскрытия изоблачителем в эстонском отделении Danske, который сообщил, что банк проигнорировал признаки, указывающие на «потенциально преступные операции» по перемещению миллиардов долларов на Запад с 2008 по 2017 годы, в том числе от российских клиентов. Многие клиенты банка были компаниями с признаками фиктивности, зарегистрированными в Великобритании. Датская юридическая фирма Bruun&Hjejle провела проверку Danske Bank и пришла к выводу, что сотрудники банка сознательно могли быть соучастниками нелегальных операций. Также в банке не контролировалось отмывание денег, там не знали владельцев многих счетов и не имели автоматического мониторинга входных транзакций. Более того, банк даже не выяснял, находятся ли клиенты под санкциями. В 2022 году Danske Bank признал себя виновным в сговоре с целью совершения банковского мошенничества. Признал, что предоставлял банковские услуги подозрительным клиентам — в том числе и в стране-агрессоре — через свой эстонский филиал, хотя знал о рисках отмывания денег. ## Отмывание денег Полом Манафортом Американский политтехнолог, экс-глава избирательной кампании Дональда Трампа — Пол Манафорт был разоблачен и осужден за отмывание средств, полученных за работу консультантом украинской Партии регионов, ее лидера и экс-президента Украины Виктора Януковича, а также Оппозиционного блока. Манафорт вместе с коллегой Ричардом Гейтсом в период с 2006 по 2015 годы заработали в Украине десятки миллионов долларов. С целью скрыть эти деньги, они в течение 2006−2016 годов отмывали средства через многочисленные компании, партнерства и банки в США и других странах. Манафорт и Гейтс действовали как агенты правительства Украины, Партии регионов, Януковича, не задекларировав в США эту деятельность и заработанные вследствие нее средства должным образом. Заметим, что по американскому законодательству такая деятельность является лоббированием в пользу иностранного государства и требует государственной регистрации. По подозрениям ФБР, Манафорт получил от «Партии регионов» и от россии 80−100 млн долларов. По данным обвинения, политтехнолог использовал миллионы долларов незадекларированных и не облагаемых налогом средств для роскошной жизни и покупки дорогой недвижимости в США. То же делал и Гейтс, также помогавший Манафорту получать эти средства с оффшорных счетов. В общей сложности через эти оффшорные счета прошло более 75 млн долларов. В обвинительном акте Манафорта были перечислены десятки компаний, созданных им вместе с Гейтсом, и сотни денежных переводов от этих компаний в пользу обоих деятелей, использованные в их схеме. В марте 2019 года Манафорт был приговорен почти к 4 годам тюрьмы за мошенничество, а впоследствии — еще к 3,5 годам за отмывание денег, препятствование правосудию и несообщение о лоббистской работе. В том же году международная журналистская организация OCCRP установила, что Янукович и Манафорт принимали участие в отмывании средств через Swedbank. Янукович вывел с помощью банка минимум 3,6 млн долларов. ## Liberty Reserve Основанная в США компания Liberty Reserve была аналогом платежной системы PayPal, но для тех, у кого нет счета в банке. В рекламе компания называла себя «самой большой системой платежей и денежных переводов». Впоследствии федеральные прокуроры назвали Liberty Reserve одной из самых крупных в истории «прачечных» для отмывания денег. Согласно судебным документам, компания отмыла в общей сложности около 8 млрд долларов. Принцип работы Liberty Reserve был такой: 1. Для создания учетной записи не требуется никакой информации, кроме адреса электронной почты. 2. Чтобы положить деньги на счет, нужно купить местную валюту через обменник в интернете. 3. За перевод денег со счета в Liberty Reserve на счет в другой системе компания получает 1% от суммы транзакции. За дополнительные 75 центов можно было купить анонимный перевод — сервис открыл номер кошелька, из которого поступал перевод. Анонимность платежей в Liberty Reserve привлекла кардеров (угонщиков данных с **[кредитных карт](https://finance.ua/cards/credit-a)**. — Ред.), продавцов нелегальных данных, организаторов финансовых пирамид и других, кто вел не совсем честный бизнес. Однако среди аккаунтов владельцев в Liberty Reserve были и добросовестные пользователи. В общей сложности в платежной системе было зарегистрировано около 5 млн аккаунтов. Основатель Liberty Reserve — бывший киевлянин Артур Будовский — в 2016 году был приговорен к 20 годам заключения. Суд признал его виновным в использовании компании для проведения огромной многонациональной операции по отмыванию денег. Прокурор Прит Бхарара назвал Liberty Reserve «банком преступного мира». Для тех, кто зарабатывает свои деньги нелегально, отмывание средств является необходимым способом избежать уголовного преследования, тратя в то же время свои нелегальные доходы. Но эта многоуровневая финансовая схема часто приводит к краху, поскольку огромные суммы денег никогда не остаются тайной надолго.

An investigation by Danish law firm Bruun&Hjejle found that Danske Bank employees may have knowingly participated in illegal activities, and the bank failed to control money laundering, did not know the owners of many accounts, and lacked automated transaction monitoring.

Новости стран мира О мерах Резервного банка ЮАР к Capitec Bank 1 января 2025 года опубликована информация о применении Резервным банком ЮАР к крупнейшему южноафриканскому банку Capitec Bank1 штрафных санкций за нарушение требований законодательства в сфере ПОД/ФТ. По результатам проведённой проверки в деятельности банка выявлены нарушения, связанные с ненадлежащим исполнением обязанностей по применению мер НПК (усиленных мер НПК), в частности, с нарушениями проводилась идентификация клиентов и бенефициарных владельцев клиентов, не применялись меры по установлению источника происхождения их средств, в установленные сроки не направлялись в ПФР СПО и СПД. Сумма штрафа за нарушения противолегализационного законодательства для банка составила более 56 млн южноафриканских рэндов (более 260 млн рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, банку объявлен выговор.

О решении Министерства юстиции США в отношении активов Danske Bank A.S. 7 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о решении передать Эстонии часть активов, конфискованных в рамках дела об ОД с участием эстонского подразделения крупнейшего датского банка Danske Bank A.S. (Danske Bank Estonia)3. В соответствии с заключённым с Минюстом США соглашением за содействие и существенный вклад Эстонии в проведение расследования в отношении Danske Bank Estonia американскими властями стране будет возвращена сумма в размере 50 млн долларов США (более 4,2 млрд рублей в эквиваленте) для целей совершенствования национальной системы противодействия финансовым преступлениям (особенно ОД/ФТ, мошенничеству и киберпреступности), развития программ обучения специалистов в противолегализационной сфере, а также криминалистической экспертизы цифровых данных и проведения кампаний по повышению осведомлённости населения о финансовых преступлениях.

О совместном докладе ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в Италии 7 января 2025 года опубликован доклад о результатах совместного исследования ПФР Италии и Банка Италии о масштабах ОД в стране4. В докладе отмечается, что задача по определению точного размера ОД в стране заведомо представляется труднодостижимой и крайне проблематичной в связи со скрытым характером незаконных финансовых потоков, а также наличием ряда ограничений, связанных с доступными данными и недостатками в применяемых до настоящего времени методологиях оценки. В рамках указанного исследования в целях получения наиболее точной оценки ОД в стране итальянским ПФР и Банком Италии использовалась усовершенствованная методология, предусматривающая процедуру тщательного отбора СПО для анализа содержащихся в них данных, применение специализированного алгоритма машинного обучения для выявления надёжной информации из массива доступных данных и использование метода статистической подборки для вычисления 3 В период 2008-2016 гг. Danske Bank в целях получения максимально возможной прибыли умышленно нарушал требования американского противолегализационного законодательства, содействовал ОД через американскую финансовую систему и в конечном итоге стал представлять собой существенную угрозу для её стабильности. Danske Bank признал ответственность за введение в заблуждение американских банков и проведение через американскую финансовую систему подозрительных операций для высокорисковых клиентов на суммы, исчисляемые в миллиардах долларов США. В 2022 г. по результатам проведённого американскими властями расследования Danske Bank был оштрафован на более чем 2 млрд долларов США (более 204,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). 4 The size of money laundering and other illicit financial conduct for Italy.

О мерах Министерства юстиции США к криптовалютной бирже BitMEX 15 января 2025 года опубликован пресс-релиз Министерства юстиции США о применении к международной криптовалютной бирже BitMEX5 штрафных санкций в связи с выявленными нарушениями требований Закона США о банковской тайне (BSA/AML)6. По результатам проверки Прокуратуры Южного округа штата Нью-Йорк установлено, что криптовалютной биржей умышленно нарушались требования BSA/AML при оказании услуг американским клиентам. В частности, биржей не была разработана, внедрена и не применялась эффективная программа по ПОД/ФТ. При этом в компании сознательно, c одобрения руководства компании, применялись минимальные требования по идентификации клиентов при принятии их на обслуживание (у клиентов запрашивалась только информация об адресе электронной почты). Топ-менеджмент компании был осведомлён о том, что проживающие на территории США клиенты как минимум с 2018 года пользовались для проведения операций торговой платформой BitMEX. При этом механизмы внутреннего контроля по ПОД/ФТ компании были абсолютно неэффективны и позволили BitMEX провести через американскую финансовую систему миллионы долларов США. За умышленное нарушений требований BSA/AML BitMEX выплатит штраф в размере 100 млн долларов США (около 8,5 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Кроме того, для биржи установлен двухлетний срок, в течение которого ей предписано устранить выявленные недостатки в части выполнения требований BSA/AML.

KuCoin осуществляла в США нелицензированную деятельность в качестве оператора по переводу денежных средств. Кроме того, в период с 2017 г. по март 2024 г. криптовалютной биржей не выполнялись требования противолегализационного законодательства, связанные с применением мер НПК, информированием ПФР о подозрительных операциях, в результате чего через биржу были проведены подозрительные операции (со средствами, полученными в результате незаконной торговли на площадках даркнет, использования вредоносного программного обеспечения, программ-вымогателей и мошеннических схем) на миллиарды долларов США. Даже после внедрения процедур НПК биржа не смогла обеспечить должным образом идентификацию уже существующих клиентов. Сумма штрафа для компании составила более 297,4 млн долларов США (более 25,1 млрд рублей в эквиваленте). Источник информации: официальный сайт Министерства юстиции США в сети Интернет. Об отчёте Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 г. 28 января 2025 года опубликован отчёт Федерального управления финансового надзора Германии (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin) о рисках финансового сектора за 2025 год. К основным рискам, угрожающим стабильности финансового сектора Германии (наряду с рисками, связанными с уязвимостями сектора недвижимости; рисками невозврата кредитов юридическими лицами; рисками кибербезопасности; рисками, связанными с изменениями на финансовом рынке; рисками рыночной концентрации в результате IT аутсорсинга), отнесены риски, связанные с ненадлежащим применением мер в сфере ПОД/ФТ. Приоритетность задач по снижению рисков ОД/ФТ в финансовом секторе Германии продолжает сохраняться на высоком уровне (с учётом того, что 96% всех СПО, поступивших в немецкое ПФР в 2023 г., были направлены представителями финансового сектора). Также BaFin зафиксирован рост рисков, связанных с использованием неофициальных систем по переводу/перемещению денежных средств и ценностей (например, хавала), новых технологий, виртуальных международных номеров банковского счёта (IBAN), криптоактивов.

О руководстве Европола по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями 30 января 2025 года Полицейской службой Европейского союза (Европола) опубликовано руководство по вопросам оперативного взаимодействия между следственными органами и финансовыми организациями в целях противодействия ОД/ФТ и другим финансовым преступлениям10. В руководстве отмечается важная роль государственно-частных партнёрств и иных аналогичных механизмов в обеспечении эффективного взаимодействия между финансовыми организациями, ПФР и следственными органами при проведении расследований преступлений, в частности ОД, в части обмена персональными данными и/или конфиденциальной информацией, связанной с уголовными расследованиями. После вступления в силу нового европейского противолегализационного законодательства стала очевидна ценность такого взаимодействия, которое позволило обмениваться не только данными о типологиях преступлений, но и специфическими данными по конкретным уголовным делам, что способствует повышению эффективности расследований и возврата преступных активов. В настоящее время государственно-частные партнёрства, обеспечивающие обмен информацией по вопросам ПОД, в той или иной форме существуют во всех странах Европы. Однако, механизмы, которые позволяют обмениваться персональными данными, относящимися к конфиденциальным расследованиям правоохранительных органов, существуют11 только в Великобритании, Дании, Ирландии, Латвии, Нидерландах и Швеции. В состав таких механизмов взаимодействия обычно входят: ПФР, полицейские ведомства, прокуратура, налоговые и надзорные органы; значимые (на национальном уровне или с операционной точки зрения) финансовые организации, 9 Пруденциальный надзор за деятельностью De Volksbank (с учётом его значимости для финансового рынка) осуществляет непосредственно ЕЦБ. 10 EFIPPP Practical Guide for Operational Cooperation between Investigative Authorities and Financial Institutions. 11 На момент публикации руководства.

Сотрудничество между компетентными органами и финансовыми организациями может осуществляться в следующих целях: - разработки новых направлений расследования; - обеспечения сбора доказательной базы по текущим расследованиям; - пресечения угроз финансовых преступлений посредством применения превентивных мер; - расширения возможностей финансовых организаций по защите от финансовых преступлений. Отмечается, что следственные органы, как правило, недооценивают тот факт, что финансовые организации играют ключевую роль в качестве «гейткиперов»12 в системе ПОД/ФТ при выявлении незаконных финансовых потоков и обладают всесторонними компетенциями и эффективными цифровыми решениями, обеспечивающими выявление преступной деятельности. Вместе с тем для того, чтобы наиболее эффективно использовать потенциал частного сектора в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями, представляется возможным изменить характер взаимодействия между компетентными ведомствами и частным сектором, которое в настоящее время в большей степени основано на исполнении частным сектором указаний со стороны государственных органов, и переориентировать его на коллективное системное реагирование на угрозы финансовых преступлений. Это в конечном итоге будет способствовать повышению эффективности уголовных расследований и укреплению потенциала частного сектора в части выявления и предотвращения финансовых преступлений.

Sa succursale estonienne disposait d’un portefeuille de clients internationaux qui recouraient fréquemment à des sociétés écrans, leur permettant de contourner la réglementation fiscale. La banque danoise a fait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment en lien avec une société française dont la gérante a été condamnée en procédure de comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité en janvier 2024. Le 18 septembre 2024, la convention judiciaire d’intérêt publique (“CJIP”) conclue entre le procureur de la République financier et la société Danske Bank A/S a été validée par le président du tribunal judiciaire de Paris[1]. Cette dernière faisait l’objet d’une enquête pour blanchiment de fraude fiscale commis en bande organisée, affaire dans laquelle la gérante personne physique d’une société d’import-export, a été condamnée pour blanchiment de [fraude fiscale](https://navacelle.law/fr/expertise/droit-penal-fiscal/) par le tribunal correctionnel de Paris, le 9 janvier 2024[2]. ##### En février 2014, le parquet de Paris a été destinataire d’une plainte pour recel d’escroquerie et blanchiment, du fonds d’investissement Hermitage Capital[3]. En juin 2014, TRACFIN a transféré[4] une note au parquet de Paris, faisant état d’une activité suspecte sur les comptes bancaires de la société française d’import-export Decobat. En effet, au titre de sa mission de service de renseignement, TRACFIN dispose de moyens d’investigation divers lui permettant de recueillir des éléments susceptibles de caractériser une infraction de blanchiment du produit d’une infraction punie d’une peine privative de liberté supérieure à un an ou du financement du terrorisme au sens de l’article L.561-30-1 du Code monétaire et financier[5]. ##### Le 8 juillet 2014, une enquête préliminaire portant notamment sur les activités d’importation en Russie de cette société a été ouverte[6]. Une information judiciaire a par la suite été ouverte le 9 avril 2015 des chefs de fraude fiscale en bande organisée, blanchiment et recel d’escroquerie en bande organisée pour des faits commis en France et de manière indivisible à l’étranger depuis 2008[7]. L’instruction a révélé que la succursale estonienne de la banque danoise, la Sampo Bank, détenait un portefeuille de milliers de clients résidant en dehors de l’Estonie (le “PNR”)[8], qu’elle savait à haut risque en raison des pays de résidence des clients, leur recours fréquent à des sociétés écrans susceptibles de masquer l’identité de leurs bénéficiaires effectifs, de l’expéditeur ou du destinataire des transactions et effectuaient des transactions suspectes[9]. Il apparaissait ainsi que la succursale était dotée d’un dispositif de conformité insuffisant concernant le PNR[10], étant donné qu’il permettait aux clients d’ouvrir des comptes et d’enregistrer des transactions sans contrôle ou diligence raisonnable[11]. L’enquête a ainsi révélé que la gérante de Decobat avait pu ouvrir deux comptes auprès de la Sampo Bank, au nom de deux sociétés écrans, utilisés comme comptes de transit pour contourner les règles fiscales et douanières[12]. En effet, la société Decobat exportait ses marchandises vers la Russie en les vendant à une société de droit russe mais en réalisant via des _brokers_ des déclarations douanières à l’import dans les pays baltes _,_ qui étaient minorées revoyant à la baisse l’évaluation des droits de douanes et de la TVA. La société russe transférait ensuite ses bénéfices au Luxembourg vers des comptes ouverts dans les Îles Vierges britanniques et au Luxembourg par le biais de ses comptes ouverts à la Sampo Bank[13]. Les audits de Danske Bank effectués jusqu’en 2014, ainsi que d’autres procédures de contrôle interne, ont systématiquement conclu à un contrôle des clients jugé satisfaisant, révélant une attitude passive et complaisante de l’entreprise, malgré les alertes de la Financial Supervisory Authority (“FSA”) danoise[14]. L’inefficacité de ces mécanismes a permis à la dirigeante de Decobat, résidente fiscale française, de transférer plus de 3 millions d’euros depuis ses deux autres sociétés vers des comptes au Luxembourg, au nom de sociétés offshore dont elle était la bénéficiaire effective[15]. ##### La Danske Bank A/S était alors été mise en examen pour des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, commis entre 2007 et 2014, aggravés par la circonstance qu’ils étaient perpétrés en bande organisée, utilisant plusieurs intermédiaires dont les opérations visaient uniquement à dissimuler la destination des fonds détournés et à en faire profiter des bénéficiaires à l’étranger[16]. Ces pratiques ont notamment conduit à la condamnation de la banque danoise en 2022, d’abord par les autorités danoises pour manquement aux obligations de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement des activités terroristes, puis par les autorités américaines pour conspiration en vue de commettre une fraude bancaire[17]. En France, la banque danoise a reconnu les faits reprochés, incriminés aux articles 324-1, 324-2, 324-3, 324-4, 324-7, 324-8 et 324-9 du Code pénal[18], lui permettant de bénéficier de la CJIP, alternative aux poursuites dont l’avantage est notamment de limiter l’amende d’intérêt public[19]. Aux termes de la [CJIP négociée](https://www.justice.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2024-09/CJIP_DANSKE_BANK_AS_20240827.pdf) avec le parquet national financier (“PNF”), elle a accepté de payer de la somme de 6 028 799€ au titre de l’amende d’intérêt public[20], après analyse des facteurs majorants, tel que le caractère répété des faits ou l’insuffisance du programme de conformité[21] et minorants, à l’instar des mesures correctives mises en place au sein de la Danske Bank ou encore de sa coopération dans l’enquête[22]. Elle a également consenti à verser 300 000 euros pour indemniser l’État français, dont 10 000 euros pour le préjudice matériel et 290 000 euros pour le préjudice moral[23]. Cette approche se distingue de celle de la Cour de cassation qui a retenu à plusieurs reprises que le délit de blanchiment de fraude fiscale ne cause à l’État aucun préjudice moral susceptible d’être réparé dès lors que le préjudice “_découlant des faits de blanchiment de fraude fiscale, caractérisé par le discrédit jeté sur les politiques de lutte contre le blanchiment_” n’est pas distinct du préjudice causé à l’intérêt général réparé par l’action du ministère public[24]. Sauf à démontrer l’existence d’un préjudice moral autre que celui lié au discrédit, cette CJIP a permis à l’État de bénéficier de la réparation d’un préjudice dont l’existence n’aurait potentiellement pas été reconnue dans le cadre d’un procès devant un Tribunal correctionnel.

The case involved Danske Bank's Estonian branch, which maintained a portfolio of high-risk international clients who frequently used shell companies to evade tax regulations. The bank was investigated for facilitating money laundering activities linked to a French import-export company, whose manager was convicted in January 2024. The investigation revealed that Danske Bank's compliance controls were inadequate, allowing clients to open accounts and conduct transactions without proper due diligence. The CJIP, validated by the Paris Judicial Court on September 18, 2024, required Danske Bank to pay a public interest fine of €6,028,799 and an additional €300,000 in compensation to the French state. The settlement took into account aggravating factors such as repeated offenses and compliance program deficiencies, as well as mitigating factors like corrective measures and cooperation with authorities. Danske Bank also faced previous penalties in Denmark and the US for related AML failures and fraud.

Судя по внутренней переписке, в компании это было поводом для шуток. #### Автор: 12 ноября 2024 г. Март 2013 года. Алексей Аверсон, клиент-менеджер в эстонском Swedbank, только что завершил встречу с потенциальными корпоративными клиентами и получил шутливое сообщение от коллеги: «Как дела на отмывочном рынке?» «Ко мне вчера приходили товарищи отмыватели с золотыми часами. Предлагали сотрудничать», — ответил Аверсон. Он добавил, что Роберт Китт, тогдашний глава отдела по работе с корпоративными клиентами и будущий гендиректор компании, в курсе событий: «Китт почти согласился, а я нет». «Китт согласился? — удивился коллега. Серьезно? Он не осознает риски?» «Его не интересует борьба с отмыванием денег, его интересует бизнес. Он один из нас, пусть будет председателем комитета :)», — отшутился Аверсон. Судя по всему, он говорил о группе банковских менеджеров и руководителей, ответственных за общение с ценными корпоративными клиентами (Китт не ответил на обвинения в сокрытии отмывания денег в банке, Аверсон отказался от подробных комментариев). Это так называемые HRNR-клиенты: высокорисковые компании-нерезиденты, многие из которых ([как позже выявило расследование](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/swedbanks-high-risk-secrets)) контролировали российские олигархи. Они обращались в эстонский Swedbank за помощью с регистрацией и управлением счетами для сложных офшорных сетей, через которые выводили миллионы долларов из России. HRNR-клиенты посодействовали успеху банка: как [сообщали СМИ](https://www.svt.se/special/swedbank/rapporten/) со ссылкой на внутренние документы Swedbank, с 2008 по 2018 год на их долю пришлось более 100 миллиардов евро от общего оборота. Благодаря этому Swedbank стал вторым по величине банком в Эстонии. Все поменялось в 2019 году, когда журналисты шведского телеканала SVT раскрыли, что Swedbank и [Danske Bank](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat/the-contract-factory-inside-danske-bank-estonias-money-laundering-machine) использовали для перемещения средств (суммарно почти шесть миллиардов долларов) через подозрительные счета в странах Балтии. Расследование OCCRP и «Важных историй» показало, что Swedbank помог одному из самых прибыльных клиентов, российскому олигарху и экс-министру Михаилу Абызову, вывести сотни миллионов долларов на офшорные счета на Кипре, Британских Виргинских Островах, в Сингапуре и Белизе. Из них 53 миллиона долларов, как позже установил российский суд, Абызов похитил из двух сибирских энергетических компаний. (С Абызовым не удалось связаться для получения комментариев, поскольку он находится в тюрьме. Когда OCCRP впервые сообщил о его счетах в Swedbank, его адвокат отказался комментировать результаты расследования.) Новости о том, что Swedbank организовал масштабную отмывочную схему для крупных корпоративных клиентов, стали основанием для международного расследования. Шведское разбирательство завершилось лишь в этом году: в сентябре бывшую руководительницу Swedbank Биргитте Боннесен [приговорили](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/swedish-court-sends-ex-ceo-of-swedbank-to-prison) к 15 месяцам тюрьмы. Суд постановил, что Боннесен, которая с 2016 по 2019 год занимала в банке должность гендиректора, а перед этим три года возглавляла отдел по работе с клиентами из стран Балтии, обманывала общественность и акционеров насчет рисков отмывания денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Власти Эстонии надеялись на аналогичный исход, открыв дело в отношении ряда топ-менеджеров, руководителей и сотрудников банка. Однако процесс застопорился, когда выяснилось, что необходимо сотрудничество России. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли, поставив под сомнение способность мировых судов преследовать коррупционеров в случаях, когда требуется содействие России или других авторитарных режимов. Журналисты не могли получить судебные документы, пока дело было открыто. Теперь же в распоряжении Delfi Estonia, партнера OCCRP, оказались следственные документы, согласно которым сотрудники банка систематически нарушали протоколы в сфере обеспечения прозрачности, чтобы помочь российским олигархам, входившим в число главных клиентов, сохранить анонимность. 300 файлов, которые эстонская прокуратура предоставила после запроса на основании Закона о свободе информации, включают отредактированные полицейские записи и внутренние документы из эстонского отделения Swedbank, в том числе письма, переписку и служебные записки. Судя по сообщениям, менеджеры по работе с клиентами вроде Аверсона (зачастую они первыми встречали новых клиентов, и их карьера зависела от удовлетворения клиентских потребностей) открыто обсуждали отмывание денег и даже шутили об этом. «Я бы не открыл ему счет, но чувак принес бутылку Hennessy X.O., — написал Аверсон коллеге в августе 2014 года. — Тогда я решил: “фиг с ним, хоть есть за что”». «Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио, — похвастался другой менеджер о клиенте. — Много отмывают, ничего не боятся». Еще один сотрудник банка написал, что его бывший коллега «по уши погряз в отмывании». Что ж, [наш коллега] В хорошо поработал [с клиентом]. Теперь отправим туда независимую делегацию. В идеале хотелось бы посмотреть без его комментариев, насколько там все прозрачно. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Не пугай там [у клиента] слишком сильно [менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. А то В заверяет, что все прекрасно, а потом появляетесь вы и наводите шухер.)) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ты же там с ним уже был, да? Все же выглядело чисто и прозрачно? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Мне нравится, как звучит «чистое и прозрачное отмывание денег».))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Ну на месте разберемся — ни у меня, ни у M\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* нет достойных часов… К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Хехехехе :9))))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Тормози, не так прямо. Все равно все тщательно проверим с Алексеем [Аверсоном]. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Понял. И вам часы нужны. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Я не привередливый) Деньги тоже норм. К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Окей. Деньги ликвиднее часов. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. А [клиент] вообще еще активен? К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Один из самых прибыльных в моем портфолио. Много отмывают, ничего не боятся. К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. Главное, что ничего не скрывают.)))) К Клиент-менеджер 2 31 января 2013 г. Точно, скоро будут платежи подписывать: «отмытые деньги, взятка, грязные деньги». К Клиент-менеджер 1 31 января 2013 г. В эстонских следственных документах есть транскрипты коммуникаций между сотрудниками Swedbank. Тут менеджеры по работе с клиентами обсуждают планы банка отправить делегацию к HRNR-клиенту, чтобы проверить его деятельность на «чистоту». Их смешит концепция «прозрачного отмывания денег». Чат переведен (оригинал на смеси русского, эстонского и английского языков), некоторые части сокращены для ясности. Имена клиентов и менеджеров, которые не были подозреваемыми в ходе расследования, скрыты. В эстонском филиале Swedbank отказались комментировать письма и другие материалы, которые получили журналисты, но сказали, что расследование закрыли «за неимением преступления». Они отметили, что на сайте юридической фирмы Clifford Chance, которую в 2019 году банк нанял для расследования возможного отмывания денег, опубликован отчет. Представители Аверсона сообщили, что он сотрудничал со следствием, а теперь хочет оставить события десятилетней давности в прошлом. ## Попав в страны Балтии, Swedbank начал активно набирать клиентов-нерезидентов Swedbank вышел в страны Балтии в 1998 году, купив контрольный пакет банковской группы Hansabank. Десятилетие спустя Swedbank полностью поглотил Hansabank и жаждал развития бизнеса: менеджеры, в особенности русскоговорящие, как Аверсон, активно собирали клиентов. «Swedbank искал нерезидентов, — рассказал Аверсон следователям в сентябре 2020 года. — Нам сказали, что нужно привести сотни или даже тысячи клиентов». Аверсону достался бывший клиент Hansabank — российская компания «Кузбассразрезуголь» (КРУ). КРУ была одним из крупнейших клиентов эстонского Swedbank: капитал предприятия оценивался в сотни миллионов долларов, а его корпоративную сеть составляли почти 200 фирм. Контролировали компанию российские олигархи Андрей Бокарев и Искандер Махмудов. Однако согласно служебной записке, которой Аверсон в 2011 году сопроводил «экстренный» запрос на открытие счетов для развивающейся офшорной сети КРУ, не все фирмы были зарегистрированы на них. Банковский сотрудник объяснил, что КРУ — важный клиент, которому требовались дополнительные офшорные компании, не связанные напрямую с Бокаревым и Махмудовым, для минимизации налогов в России. В 2011 году портфолио Аверсона расширилось: КРУ продала одну из компаний Абызову — мультимиллионеру и близкому соратнику тогдашнего российского президента Дмитрия Медведева. Бизнес-группа Ru-Com Абызова участвовала во многих энергетических, строительных и сельскохозяйственных проектах. Аверсон ездил в Москву, чтобы лично подготовить бумаги для сделки. Через несколько месяцев ему сообщили, что Абызов хочет открыть множество офшорных счетов для Ru-Com. «Клиент обещает внести приличные депозиты в Swedbank», — написал Аверсон коллегам. Близость Абызова к тогдашнему президенту Медведеву делала его «политически значимым лицом» с повышенными коррупционными рисками, а значит, к нему должны были применить усиленный контроль. Однако согласно служебной записке, банковский комитет по работе с HRNR-клиентами без лишних вопросов согласился принять Ru-Com и Абызова — «главного бенефициара компаний-нерезидентов». Как сообщил Аверсон следователям, позже в Swedbank ввели некоторые ограничения касательно подбора клиентов. «Банк не работал с игорными и алкогольными бизнесами, у остальных компаний даже не спрашивали о происхождении активов», — поделился он. Вчера тоже — «Увеличьте мой лимит на 1 млн евро, нужно дать в долг «партнерам». Полный бардак. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Мои или чьи-то еще? А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Нет, нет, это клиенты [клиент-менеджера] М\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. К Клиент-менеджер 23 апреля 2014 г. Хехе, это фигня. Теперь [клиент по прозвищу] Крокодил перевел 8 миллионов в Россию. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. Вот это кредит. Но миллион — это мелочь. А Алексей Аверсон 23 апреля 2014 г. В разговоре между клиент-менеджером Swedbank Алексеем Аверсоном и коллегой основное внимание уделяется запросу неназванного клиента HRNR на перевод крупной суммы денег. IВ мае 2012 года Медведев, тогда премьер-министр, назначил Абызова министром по делам открытого правительства. Судя по всему, работа в правительстве не помешала бизнесу россиянина. Империя Ru-Com продолжила процветать. Согласно внутреннему документу за январь 2014 года, Swedbank открыл для Ru-Com 53 банковских счета. Хорошие новости вскоре попали в головной офис в Швеции: Китт переслал Боннесен сообщение, в котором Аверсон называет Абызова «одним из самых инновационных бизнесменов в России» и отмечает, что объем депозитов на счетах Ru-Com достиг 30 миллионов евро. ## Схемы с участием КРУ и Ru-Com привлекли внимание банковских контролеров Какое-то время КРУ и Ru-Com были крупнейшими клиентами-нерезидентами эстонского филиала Swedbank, однако к 2016 году в банке засомневались в правильности такого положения дел. Андреас Хоббелин, контролер Swedbank Group из Норвегии, начал задавать вопросы насчет КРУ и того, в какой степени аффилированные предприятия вроде Carbo One (компания по торговле углем, которой официально владели два других бизнесмена) на самом деле контролируют Махмудов и Бокарев. Махмудов тогда засветился в международных медиа в связи со схемой отмывания денег, выявленной в рамках испанской операции против российских преступников, известной как «Тройка». (Махмудов и Бокарев позже попали под санкции Минфина США [за связи с организованной преступностью](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1731).) [Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов](/processed/containers/assets/features/iskander-makhmudov.jpg/ef38d5c485ca2a8a058bda1a06fdd9fd/iskander-makhmudov.jpg) Фото: УГМК-Холдинг, Wikimedia Российский олигарх Искандер Махмудов К лету вопросы Хоббелина дошли до Аверсона, которого отправили на Кипр для личной встречи с одним из официальных собственников компании, гражданином Узбекистана. Аверсон позже сообщил, что его собеседник «произвел впечатление адекватного человека, очень спокойного и уверенного». Один из руководителей Swedbank, Хейки Раадик, надеялся, что благодаря неприметным владельцам Carbo One может остаться клиентом компании. При подготовке материалов о Carbo One для контролеров он пытался минимизировать связи компании с российскими олигархами. «Я бы удалил это сообщение: \"Махмудов и Бокарев имеют влияние на компанию, однако нет документальных подтверждений того, что [официальные собственники] — подставные лица\". Постарайтесь о них как можно меньше/короче упоминать», — написал он. Банкир выразил надежду на то, что этот вопрос не дойдет до банковского комитета по этике. Тем не менее в 2017 году Carbo One, Махмудов и Бокарев привлекли внимание Мари-Лийс Кург, начальницы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в эстонском филиале Swedbank. Кург ранее возглавляла аналогичный отдел в другом крупном эстонском банке, SEB. Swedbank нанял ее для совершенствования работы в сфере прозрачности. Однако все ее требования по соблюдению правил встречали жесткое сопротивление. «Разница в культуре комплаенс-контроля в двух банках меня поразила», — сказала она OCCRP. Обеспокоенная происходящим, Кург направила отчет о подозрительной активности в эстонское подразделение финансовой разведки (FIU) — правительственное агентство, ответственное за расследование случаев отмывания денег и других финансовых преступлений. Она указала, что Махмудов и Бокарев — «истинные бенефициары более 200 клиентов (компаний) в юрисдикциях с низким налогообложением», которых обслуживает Swedbank. «По данным неофициальных источников, клиенты замешаны в коррупционной деятельности и, вероятно, отмывании денег», — написала Кург в сопроводительном письме. В переписке с супервайзерами в Swedbank она предупредила, что дальнейшее сотрудничество с высокорисковыми клиентами вроде Carbo One поставит банк в трудное положение. Ранее в Deutsche Bank, обрабатывавшем некоторые транзакции Swedbank, сказали, что больше не будут принимать платежи «политически значимых лиц». Кург спросила, проходили ли средства Carbo One через Deutsche Bank за последние 18 месяцев. «Если да, вероятно, мы имеем дело с нарушением условий договора», — пояснила она. «Я все выходные переживала», — написала Кург. Получив отчет о подозрительной активности, FIU вызвало на допрос Кург и Свена Киввистика, тогдашнего главу отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег в странах Балтии. Судя по внутренней переписке, руководители Swedbank забеспокоились. Китт назвал ситуацию «болезненной. Очень болезненной». «Мы имеем дело не с копами-новичками, — написал Киввистик, отметив, что один из следователей имел за плечами опыт более двадцати лет работы в полиции. — Его точно нельзя недооценивать». Менеджеры банка просчитывали, как Киввистику лучше общаться с FIU, чтобы минимизировать последствия показаний Кург. «Вопрос в том, как нейтрализовать активного и глупого человека, перед которым сидят опытные следователи, — написал Китт Киввистику о Кург. — Они сразу поймут по языку тела, если ты попытаешься ее оговорить». Кург говорит, что вскоре после допроса в FIU ее уволили. «Это был очень сложный период в моей карьере, — поделилась она. — Я не могла объяснить внезапное увольнение». Киввистик отказался от комментариев. ## Российский приговор Абызова помог Swedbank избежать наказания в Эстонии Судя по всему, в эстонском Swedbank поняли, что продолжать отношения с крупнейшим HRNR-клиентом — плохая идея, и в конце 2016 года прекратили сотрудничать с компаниями Ru-Com. К моменту, когда Кург направила отчет властям, та же участь постигла КРУ. Когда Swedbank дистанцировался от КРУ и Ru-Com, Аверсон — клиент-менеджер, который был ключевым звеном в работе с ними, — покинул банк и нашел нового работодателя — Абызова. Будучи директором одной из кипрских компаний россиянина, Аверсон отвечал за руководство [элитными активами](https://youtu.be/y35SmhHa4jA) Il Tesoro в Тоскане, включающими несколько вилл, теннисный корт, виноградники, оливковые рощи и вертолетную площадку. Сам Абызов в 2018 году покинул Россию, не получив второй срок в должности министра. В следующем году в ходе короткой поездки домой его арестовали и обвинили в хищении более 53 миллионов долларов из сибирских энергетических холдингов и выводе средств за границу. В декабре 2023 года его приговорили к 12 годам тюрьмы. Официальное расследование в отношении банка в Эстонии открыли в июле 2019 года. В центре внимания оказался тот факт, что Swedbank обманывал банки-корреспонденты и следователей, скрывая, что Абызов был главным бенефициаром структур Ru-Com. В 2015 году, когда в FIU запросили данные о владельцах нескольких фирм Ru-Com, эстонский филиал предоставил имена номинальных владельцев — хотя, как подтверждает переписка Аверсона, в банке знали, что за компаниями стоял Абызов. Два года спустя правоохранители отправили еще один запрос. Судя по утечке, банковский сотрудник обратился к коллеге за советом: «Знаю, что у тебя какие-то договоренности с Туулингом (Тоомас Туулинг — предшественник Кург на должности главы отдела по борьбе с отмыванием денег) касательно того, что некоторых нельзя называть, чтобы они сохранили анонимность». (Туулинг сообщил OCCRP, что это неправда, и у него «не было договоренностей с целью скрыть личность клиента или утаить информацию от властей». Он сказал, что банк не предоставил FIU информацию об Абызове, поскольку данные о бенефициарах держали отдельно от общей клиентской базы, доступной сотням сотрудников, чтобы защитить важных клиентов от возможных утечек. «Вне зависимости от того, где хранили информацию, менеджеры обязаны были передавать точные данные Комитету по работе с высокорисковыми клиентами», — добавил он.) Арест Абызова был важен для эстонского следствия, ведь требовалось доказать, что деньги, которые, предположительно, отмывали в Swedbank, — это доходы от преступной деятельности (в Эстонии, как и во многих других странах, даже при веских доказательствах отмывание денег не считается правонарушением без наличия предикатного преступления). Юридическая фирма Clifford Chance, которую Swedbank нанял после скандала 2019 года, установила, что с 2014 по 2019 год через эстонский филиал прошло более 21 миллиарда евро подозрительных транзакций. Однако в центре эстонского расследования оказалась лишь малая часть этой суммы — 53 миллиона долларов, которые, как установили правоохранители, провели через счета Абызова, прежде чем вывести на Кипр или обратно в Россию. Однако российский приговор олигарха предоставил адвокатам Swedbank уникальную возможность: они заявили, что Абызов — жертва политически мотивированного разбирательства, поскольку судья, который вел его дело, также вынес решения в пользу правительства в двух громких разбирательствах в отношении борцов с коррупцией. Защита настаивала на том, что Абызов может быть очередной жертвой кремлевского преследования. Доводы защиты о предвзятости приговора поставили правоохранителей в уязвимое положение: им требовались судебные документы из России. Из-за санкций и войны в Украине двустороннее сотрудничество между странами остановлено, и подать соответствующий запрос невозможно. Несмотря на наличие существенных доказательств обработки подозрительных транзакций, слабого документирования и контроля в Swedbank, а также компрометирующих внутренних коммуникаций, власти не смогли довести до конца один из самых громких скандалов вокруг отмывания денег в Эстонии. В феврале 2024 года дело закрыли. ### Что делать, если отмывают деньги из «захваченного государства»? Эксперты по борьбе с коррупцией говорят, что произошедшее в эстонском филиале Swedbank вызывает опасения касательно возможности расследовать случаи отмывания денег c участием изолированных стран или государств под санкциями вроде России. «Это обычная ситуация, — говорит юрист Transparency International Куш Амин. — Правоохранители, которые просят правовой помощи у захваченного государства, понимают, что, скорее всего, не добьются уровня сотрудничества, необходимого для доказательства предикатного преступления к отмыванию средств. Особенно если в деле замешаны высокопоставленные чиновники или физические и юридические лица со связями в политике». Амин рассказал, что во Франции придумали возможное решение этой проблемы. Там доказательства требуют не от обвинения, а от защиты: необходимо обосновать легальность подозрительных транзакций. «Эта тактика, так называемая опровержимая презумпция, предоставляет правоохранителям лазейку в случае, если предикатное преступление совершено в стране, которая не готова сотрудничать, — говорит Амин. — Введение опровержимой презумпции — один из вариантов решения проблем, связанных, например, с отслеживанием нелегальных финансовых потоков из России». По мнению Алара Лехесметса, представителя эстонской прокуратуры, опровержимая презумпция может повысить успешность будущих расследований. «Однако пока, насколько мы знаем, законодатели не предпринимали шагов в этом направлении», — отметил он. Как говорит Маркко Кюннапу, советник в Минюсте Эстонии, получить доказательства из России было непросто и до того, как война в Украине прервала сотрудничество между странами. Тем не менее, несмотря на неудачу с Swedbank, он считает, что расследовать случаи отмывания денег с предикатными преступлениями в России возможно. ## Многие причастные к расследованию сотрудники Swedbank ушли из банковской сферы Многие банкиры, причастные к делу Swedbank, сменили сферу деятельности. Бывший гендиректор банка Китт возглавляет теплоснабжающую компанию. Состоявший в правлении Раадик — финдиректор Таллинского технического университета. Оба отказались от подробных комментариев из соображений защиты конфиденциальности. «Разбирательство было долгим; если бы у прокуратуры были ко мне какие-то претензии, дело бы не закрыли», — сообщил Раадик OCCRP. Китт сказал, что попавшие к журналистам файлы — «версия одной стороны, то есть обвинения». Адвокат Аверсона говорит, что его клиент сотрудничал со следствием. «Аверсон хочет оставить прошлое позади. Он работает в Эстонии, платит налоги и заботится о своей семье», — добавил он. Представительница эстонского филиала Swedbank сказала, что финансовое учреждение «полностью сотрудничало» с прокуратурами Эстонии и Швеции. Она добавила, что банк «неуклонно соблюдает» протоколы противодействия отмыванию денег. «Swedbank в числе банков с наименьшим уровнем риска на местном рынке и ориентирован на обслуживание местных клиентов», — сказала она. Кург, экс-контролер в Swedbank, руководит частным стартапом в сфере управления рисками. Она говорит, что произошедшее ее не отпускает. «Важно помнить, что контролеры работают не против компании, а преследуют более глобальную цель: защитить бизнес и минимизировать риски, последствия которых могут оказаться разрушительными, — пояснила она. — К сожалению, в случае Swedbank риски материализовались». 12 ноября 2024 г. 12 ноября 2024 г. ### **Присоединяйтесь.** **Привлеките власть к ответу.** [Поддержать](https://membership.occrp.org/accomplice) Поддержка читателей помогает OCCRP разоблачать организованную преступность и коррупцию по всему миру.

Das unter Führung der S&D-Fraktion ausgehandelte Gesetzespaket wird die Spielregeln stark verändern und dazu beitragen, Skandale zu verhindern, wie wir sie in den letzten Jahren nur allzu oft erlebt haben. Das übergeordnete Ziel der neuen Rechtsvorschriften ist die Vereinheitlichung der geltenden nationalen Regeln – die zu fragmentiert und nicht gut aufeinander abgestimmt sind –, mit dem Ziel, die Vorschriften besser durchsetzen zu können und den gemeinsamen Kampf gegen Geldwäsche zu verstärken. Die Bedeutung der neuen Regeln lässt sich anhand einiger konkreter Beispiele illustrieren: Für Superreiche, zu denen auch russische Oligarchen zählen, wird es sehr viel schwerer, das System zu überlisten und Kontrollen zu umgehen. Die Vorschriften dienen außerdem dazu, im Fußball aufzuräumen, und die Risiken einzudämmen, die aus der Vergabe „goldener Visa“ resultieren. **Eero** **Heinäluoma, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Wirtschaftsausschuss, sagte:** „Heute ist ein guter Tag für die Bürger und Unternehmen in der EU und ein schlechter Tag für Oligarchen und Terroristen. Die lang erwartete Reform war angesichts der Skandale in den letzten Jahren, an denen die Danske Bank und die Credit Suisse beteiligt waren, und der jüngsten Enthüllungen aus Zypern wahrhaft notwendig. Die neuen Regeln werden die Dunkelmänner hinter undurchsichtigen rechtlichen Strukturen ans Licht bringen. Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt zu mehr Unternehmenstransparenz. Sie gilt auch für Unternehmen mit Sitz außerhalb der EU: Falls diese in der EU Geschäfte machen wollen, müssen sie ihre Eigentumsverhältnisse im Register wirtschaftlicher Eigentümer offenlegen. Da bei der Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung Bargeld eine große Rolle spielt, werden Barzahlungen über 10.000 Euro in der EU verboten. Dadurch können Transaktionen mithilfe hoher Geldbeträge besser kontrolliert werden, um Geldwäsche zu verhindern.“ **Paul Tang, sozialdemokratischer Verhandlungsführer für das EU-Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket im Justizausschuss, meinte:** „Eins unserer Hauptziele war, dafür zu sorgen, dass Wirtschaftskriminelle nicht länger durch den Kauf teurer Autos, Jachten und Privatflugzeuge Geldwäsche betreiben können. Die neuen Vorschriften erschweren es den Reichen und Mächtigen, ohne richtige Kontrollen in der EU zu investieren und Sanktionen zu umgehen, da ihre Prestigeobjekte nun den Behörden gemeldet werden müssen. Durch diese historische Einigung entstehen das erste einheitliche europäische Regelwerk zur Geldwäschebekämpfung und eine neue EU-Behörde mit umfassenden Kontroll- und Koordinierungsbefugnissen. Nicht nur der Finanz-, sondern auch der Nichtfinanzsektor wird künftig wesentlich strengeren Regeln und einer verstärkten Aufsicht unterworfen. Wichtig ist, dass die Regeln auch für die Kryptobranche gelten.“ **Hinweis für die Redaktion:** Das Anti-Geldwäsche-Paket besteht aus einer Verordnung und einer Richtlinie zur Verhinderung von Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung sowie einer Verordnung zur Errichtung einer neuen EU-Behörde, deren Aufgabe es sein wird, Geldwäsche und Terrorismusfinanzierung zu unterbinden. Über die letztgenannte Verordnung wurde bereits letzten Monat Einigkeit erzielt, während der Rest des Pakets gestern Abend festgezurrt wurde. **Hier eine Liste der wichtigsten von der S&D-Fraktion durchgesetzten Punkte in dem Paket:** **In der Verordnung zur Bekämpfung der Geldwäsche:** * Erweiterung der Liste von Einrichtungen, die die Vorschriften befolgen müssen, um hochrangige Profifußballvereine und -agenten, Anbieter von Kryptowerten, Vermittler von „goldenen Visa“ sowie Personen, die mit Luxusgütern handeln. Da das Fußballgeschäft und seine Risiken in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten jedoch sehr unterschiedlich sind, können für kleinere Vereine Ausnahmen gelten, falls das Risiko nachweislich gering ist und sie von der Kommission genehmigt werden.

Согласно договоренности, полученные от США миллионы направляются на профилактику, выявление и расследование финансовых преступлений, включая отмывание денег, киберпреступления и финансирование терроризма. Соглашение одновременно укрепляет взаимодействие Эстонии и США в противодействии финансовым преступлениям и подчеркивает нашу совместную приверженность принципам правового государства во всем мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов курирует комиссия, в состав которой входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом конкурсном раунде поддержаны девять предложений на общую сумму 25,7 млн евро. Комиссия исходила из того, что проекты должны представлять собой логическое целое и усиливать потенциал не отдельных учреждений, а системно укреплять борьбу с финансовой преступностью. Целью является поддержка профилактики, совершенствование практик расследования, технологическая поддержка и устойчивое обучение. Это поможет обеспечить осведомленность специалистов, работающих в столь сложной сфере, о последних достижениях, рисках и технологических изменениях, а также способность успешно применять полученные навыки и знания. Инициативы нацелены на предупреждение коррупции, повышение осведомленности о финансовых мошенничествах, эффективное выявление, арест и конфискацию преступных доходов, наращивание потенциала в борьбе с киберпреступлениями, улучшение возможностей по выявлению и анализу доходов от криптоактивов, а также на укрепление финансового надзора для более эффективного противодействия отмыванию денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент полиции безопасности, Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция и все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. «То, что штрафные средства по делам об отмывании денег направляются на проекты по сокращению экономической преступности, имеет символическое значение. Поскольку финансовые преступления крайне специфичны, сложны и технически емки, особенно важно, что благодаря этим ресурсам мы сможем усилить возможности следователей, прокуроров и судей эффективно рассматривать такие дела», - сказала канцлер Министерства юстиции и цифровых дел Тийна Уудеберг. «Показательно и то, что часть средств направляется непосредственно на профилактику, в том числе создается стратегическая рамка для предотвращения коррупции», - добавила она. Канцлер Министерства внутренних дел Тармо Мийлитс отметил, что дополнительные ресурсы позволят совершить важный рывок в расследовании технически сложных, как правило требующих международного сотрудничества и наносящих большой ущерб киберпреступлений. «Доходы от киберпреступности занимают высокое место рядом с оборотом наркотиков и коррупцией, поэтому особенно важно опережать преступников на шаг в навыках, знаниях и технических возможностях», - подчеркнул он. «Не менее важно выстроить устойчивую систему обучения, чтобы развитие компетенций в расследовании финансовых преступлений стало одним из столпов борьбы с преступностью. Совместно реализуемые проекты сделают работу правоохранительных органов эффективнее, чтобы поиск, арест и конфискация имущества, связанного с преступлениями, были результативнее, а снижение прибыльности преступной деятельности - успешнее», - указал Мийлитс. Министерство финансов акцентировало внимание на наращивании потенциала Финансовой инспекции по предотвращению отмывания денег. «Благодаря проектам у налоговой службы появится возможность получать сведения о транзакциях с криптоактивами, чтобы взыскивать неуплаченные налоги и обмениваться данными для выявления связанных преступлений», - сказала канцлер Министерства финансов Мерике Сакс. «Очень хорошо, что проекты предусматривают и информирование общества, и профилактику, например, чтобы люди не становились жертвами финансовых мошенничеств», - подчеркнула она.

Кроме того, средства будут использованы для повышения осведомлённости о финансовых и киберпреступлениях, а также для развития процедур по аресту и конфискации преступных доходов, в том числе в рамках международного сотрудничества. Соглашение также укрепляет сотрудничество между Эстонией и США в борьбе с финансовыми преступлениями и демонстрирует, что обе страны совместно отстаивают принципы правового государства во всём мире. Отбор и реализацию соответствующих проектов координирует комиссия, в которую входят канцлеры Министерства юстиции и цифровых технологий, Министерства финансов и Министерства внутренних дел Эстонии, а также представитель США в качестве наблюдателя. В первом туре проектов было поддержано девять инициатив на общую сумму 25,7 миллиона евро. При отборе комиссия исходила из принципа, что проекты должны образовывать логически связанное целое и усиливать потенциал не только отдельных учреждений, но и системно укреплять борьбу с финансовыми преступлениями. Целью было обеспечить, чтобы проекты способствовали как профилактике, так и совершенствованию следственной практики, технологической поддержке и устойчивой системе обучения. Это поможет гарантировать, что в столь сложной сфере работают специалисты, хорошо осведомлённые о последних тенденциях, рисках и технологических изменениях, и способные эффективно применять полученные знания и навыки. Проекты направлены на предотвращение коррупции, повышение осведомлённости о финансовом мошенничестве, улучшение выявления, ареста и конфискации преступных доходов, укрепление возможностей по борьбе с киберпреступностью, повышение потенциала по выявлению и анализу криптодоходов, а также на усиление финансового надзора для более эффективной борьбы с отмыванием денег. Реализацией проектов занимаются Прокуратура, Департамент полиции и погранохраны, Налогово-таможенный департамент, Департамент окружающей среды, Департамент государственной безопасности (КАПО), Академия внутренней безопасности, Финансовая инспекция, а также все три министерства, участвующие в работе комиссии. _Читайте по теме:_ [**Цахкна: Передача штрафных денег доказывает глубину

Nov. 2017 | 09:00 Uhr | von Gerd Mischler Aktualisiert am: 16. Jan. 2024 ## Wirecard, Siemens, VW # Die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale in Deutschland Manager-Versagen oder kriminelle Energie: Für diese 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale mussten die Beteiligten oft beides aufbringen. Diese Firmen waren mit besonderem „Engagement“ dabei. Können Sie sich noch erinnern? Schon so einige deutsche Unternehmen und Manager haben Negativschlagzeilen gemacht. Wir haben die größten Skandale für Sie zusammengestellt. (Bild: Goss Vitalij - stock.adobe.com) Ob Steuerbetrug, Schneeballsystem oder großflächige Bilanzfälschung: Deutsche Unternehmen haben sich in der Vergangenheit einiges einfallen lassen, um in die (negativen) Schlagzeilen zu kommen. Wir haben die 10 größten Wirtschaftsskandale zusammengetragen – garantiert subjektiv und ausdrücklich nicht wertfrei. #### Platz 10: Arcandor – Thomas Middelhoff veruntreut Millionen Obwohl es ihm nicht gelungen war, den Handelskonzern Arcandor und seine Töchter Karstadt, Quelle, Primondo und Thomas Cook zu retten, lässt sich Vorstandschef Thomas Middelhoff kurz vor der Pleite im Jahr 2009 rund 2,3 Millionen Euro Bonus auszahlen. Dafür wurde er wegen Veruntreuung zu drei Jahren Haft verurteilt, von denen er zwei absitzen musste. Middelhoff pendelte außerdem auf Firmenkosten für 1,1 Millionen Euro mit dem Hubschrauber von seiner Villa in Bielefeld zur Arbeit in die Essener Arcandorzentrale und ließ sich mit Privatjets in seine Villa in St. Tropez und nach New York fliegen. Einen Beigeschmack hinterließ auch der Verkauf von fünf Immobilien an einen Fonds, an dem Middelhoff und seine Frau beteiligt waren. Der Fonds vermietete die fünf Kaufhäuser für durchschnittlich gut 8,5 Millionen Jahresmiete an Karstadt. Für ihre 164 anderen Filialen zahlte die Kette dagegen nur jeweils 1,7 Millionen Euro Miete. #### Platz 9: Mannesmann-Vodafone – Abfindungsaffäre bei Übernahme Der Deal ist perfekt. Am 4. Februar 2000 stimmt nach einer spektakulären Abwehrschlacht der Mannesmann-Aufsichtsrat der Übernahme des Industriekonzerns durch Vodafone für 178 Milliarden Euro zu. Noch am selben Tag verteilen im Aufsichtsratsausschuss für Vorstandsangelegenheiten Deutsche-Bank-Vorstand Josef Ackermann, Mannesmann-Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Funk und IG-Metall-Boss Klaus Zwickel 30 Millionen Euro „Anerkennungsprämien“ an Topmanager bei Mannesmann. Obwohl eine Stuttgarter Kanzlei deshalb am 24. Februar 2000 Anzeige wegen des Verdachts auf Untreue erstattet, verteilt der Ausschuss im März weitere 32 Millionen Euro an bereits pensionierte Mannesmann-Vorstände. Das Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf spricht Ackermann, Funk und Zwickel zunächst vom Vorwurf der Untreue frei. Später hebt der Bundesgerichtshof das Urteil auf. Im zweiten Anlauf wird das Verfahren gegen eine Zahlung von 5,8 Millionen Euro eingestellt. ## Platz 8: Flowtex - Schneeballsystem mit fiktiven Bohrmaschinen In den 90er Jahren betrog der badische Unternehmer Manfred Schmider Banken und Versicherungen um rund zwei Milliarden Euro. Seine Firma Flowtex produzierte Horizontalbohrsysteme, mit denen man unterirdisch Kabel verlegt, ohne die Straßen aufzureißen. Flowtex verkaufte zahlreiche dieser Systeme an Investoren und leaste sie anschließend zurück. Dieses Vorgehen ist an sich nicht unüblich, nur dass in diesem Fall die meisten der Geräte gar nicht existierten. Das Unternehmen täuschte einen hohen Bestand an Bohrern vor, indem es an die wenigen real exisiterenden Systeme immer neue Seriennummern schraubte. Um die Leasingraten zahlen zu können, musste die Firma im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr fiktive Maschinen verkaufen – es war ein Schneeballsystem. Im Februar 2000, nur Tage vor dem geplanten Börsengang, wurden Schmider und weitere Verantwortliche festgenommen. Er war sieben Jahre in Haft, bevor er auf Bewährung entlassen wurde. Im Jahr 2016 wurde er in der Schweiz dann erneut zu einer Haftstrafe verurteilt - wegen Geldwäsche. ## Das sind die 6 größten Schneeballsysteme der Geschichte 1. **Madoff Investment Securities**. Anlageverluste: 60 Milliarden Euro - Die nach ihrem Gründer Bernhard Madoff benannte Investmentfirma galt lange Zeit als einer der zuverlässigsten Partner an der Wall Street. Allerdings stellte sich 40 Jahre später heraus, dass Madoff die Renditen seiner Kunden mit den Einlagen neuer Kunden bezahlte. Seine Söhne zeigten ihn schließlich an und ein Gericht verurteilte ihn zu 150 Jahren Gefängnis. Sein Betrug betraf Millionen von Menschen und trieb etliche in den Selbstmord. 2. **MMM.** Anlageverluste: Über 1,85 Milliarden Euro - 1989 gründete Sergey Mavrodi in Moskau mit seinem Bruder und seiner Frau MMM. Das Unternehmen verkaufte sehr erfolgreich Bürogeräte, bis Probleme mit dem Finanzamt auftraten. Daraufhin wechselte MMM in den Finanzsektor und gab alsbald eigene Aktien heraus. Diese wurden ohne erkennbaren Grund stetig teurer. Die Zahl der Anleger stieg rapide an, nachdem eine Rendite von bis zu 1.000 Prozent kolportiert wurde. Innerhalb von sechs Monaten stieg der Wert der Wertpapiere um das 127-fache. Im Jahr 1994 versprach das Unternehmen Dividenden in Höhe von 3.000 Prozent pro Jahr. Allerdings wurden die hohen Zinsen auf alte Einlagen immer nur durch das Anziehen neuer Einlagen finanziert. Als das Geld nicht mehr ausreichte, reduzierte MMM die Papiere auf den Ausgabewert. Das System brach zusammen. Unmittelbar nach dieser Nachricht begingen 50 Menschen Selbstmord. Mavrodi wurde verhaftet und verurteilt. Seine Machenschaften betrafen rund 15 Millionen Menschen. 3. **Stanford International Bank**. Anlageverlust: 7,4 Milliarden Euro - Der erfolglose Immobilienmakler Robert Allen Stanford gründete 1986 in Antigua und Barbuda die Stanford International Bank. Diese Bank gab Einlagenzertifikate als Alternative zu einer Einlage aus und warb mit Renditen weit über dem Marktwert. Die Einlagen schienen durch das Vermögen gedeckt zu sein, da Stanford die Bilanzen der Bank frisierte. Die hohen Zinsen auf die Einlagenzertifikate wurden tatsächlich nur durch das Geld neuer Anleger gezahlt. Dies funktionierte 23 Jahre lang, bis Robert Allen Stanford im Jahr 2012 wegen Betrugs zu einer Haftstrafe von 110 Jahren verurteilt wurde. 4. **European Kings Club**. Anlageverlust: 1 Milliarde Euro´- Der Fall \\'European Kings Club\\' war das größte europäische Schneeballsystem und war von 1992 bis 1994 im DACH-Bereich aktiv. Der Klub sollte seinen Mitgliedern, KMU-Unternehmern, finanzielle Unterstützung bieten. Um Mitglied zu werden, musste man sich einen Anteil für umgerechnet 715 Euro kaufen. Dafür sollten dann jeden Monat etwa 102 Euro ausgezahlt werden - natürlich mit den Anteilserlösen der neuesten Mitglieder. Das funktionierte, bis die Behörden die Gründerin des Clubs, Damara Bertges, und ihren Partner verhafteten. Die Finanzämter beschlagnahmten 255,6 Millionen Euro und gaben sie an die Investoren zurück. 5. **Caritas / John Stoica**. Anlageverluste: 930 Millionen Euro - Innerhalb eines Jahres betrog John Stoica mit seiner Firma Caritas (die Namensgleichheit mit der karitativen kirchlichen Organisation war beabsichtigt) rund 4 Millionen Rumänen. Er versprach Zinsen von 800 Prozent in 3 Monaten. Sogar Teile der Regierung und Verwaltung unterstützten das Unternehmen. Das Schneeballsystem brach schnell zusammen. Viele Rumänen hatten investiert und es bestand die Furcht vor Straßenprotesten und weiteren Reaktionen wütender Investoren. Caritas nahm etwa 3 Milliarden US-Dollar ein und besaß auf dem Höhepunkt des Erfolgs ein Drittel aller rumänischen Banknoten. John Stoica verbrachte 1,5 Jahre im Gefängnis. 6. **Mutual Benefits Corporation**. Anlageverluste: 1,15 Milliarden Euro - Im Jahr 1994 gründete Joel Steinger die Mutual Benefits Corporation, obwohl die US-Börsenaufsichtsbehörde den Verkauf von Wertpapieren bereits verboten hatte. Die Vorgehensweise war folgende: Die Mutual Benefits Corporation kaufte Versicherungspolicen von Patienten mit unheilbaren Krankheiten, verkaufte sie an Dritte weiter und wurde zum Vermittler zwischen der Versicherungsgesellschaft und den neuen Eigentümern. Diese zahlten monatliche Beiträge und sollten im Gegenzug einen guten Prozentsatz der Sterbegeldzahlung erhalten. Das Unternehmen lieferte falsche Berichte über die Krankheiten der Versicherungsnehmer. Da jedoch kaum jemand tatsächlich starbst, wurden mit dem Geld neuer Investoren alte Investoren bezahlt. Im Jahr 2001 übergab ein Mitarbeiter von Mutual Benefits Informationen an die Polizei. Joel Steinger wurde daraufhin im Jahr 2014 zu 20 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. #### Platz 7: MAN – Schmiergeldauszahlungen in bar Dreist: Wer im Dienste der Volkswagentochter bis 2009 Kunden schmieren wollte, ließ sich die erforderliche Summe in bar an der Kasse auszahlen. Später verschleierte der Münchner Nutzfahrzeughersteller die Korruption mit Briefkastenfirmen und Scheinverträgen mit vermeintlichen Beratern in Slowenien und Liechtenstein. Die insgesamt rund 50 Millionen Schmiergelder schlug [MAN](https://www.produktion.de/schwerpunkte/mega-maschinen/man-und-basf-wollen-die-groesste-waermepumpe-der-welt-bauen-691.html) auf den Preis für seine Busse und Lkw drauf. So ließen sich die Münchner den Betrug von den Steuerzahlern in den Abnehmerstaaten finanzieren. Im Jahr 2009 flogen die Machenschaften auf. Die Affäre kostete MAN über 250 Millionen Euro – größter Posten war mit 150,6 Millionen Euro die Geldbuße der Staatsanwaltschaft. #### Platz 6: Scania - Rekord-Bußgeld für LKW-Kartell 1997 bis 2010 sprachen sich mehrere europäische LKW-Hersteller über Preise ab und über die Einführung neuer Emissionstechnologien sowie die Weitergabe der damit verbundenen Kosten. Die ersten Treffen der leitenden Manager:innen fanden in Brüssel und auf Messen statt. Später verlagerte sich die Organisation zu den Tochterunternehmen der deutschen Hersteller. MAN ließ das Kartell schließlich auffliegen und ging als Kronzeuge straffrei aus, während die anderen Hersteller Geldbußen zahlen mussten. DAF, Daimler Iveco und Volvo/Renault teilten sich eine Rekord-Kartellbuße von insgesamt 2,93 Milliarden Euro. Scania arbeitete nicht mit den Ermittlern zusammen und büßte deshalb in einem getrennten Verfahren mit 880 Millionen Euro. #### Platz 5: Siemens – Größter Schmiergeldskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte Am 15. November 2006 durchsuchen Fahnder Büros an 30 [Siemens](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft/175-jahre-siemens-vom-zeigertelegraf-zum-digitalisierer-337.html)-Standorten. Auch Privatwohnungen führender Manager des Konzerns blieben nicht unbehelligt. Sie finden Beweise für wenigstens 4.300 Schmiergeldzahlungen. Damit hatte sich der Elektronik- und Telekommunikationskonzern zwischen 1999 und 2006 Aufträge in Ägypten, Saudi-Arabien, Indonesien und Griechenland erkauft. Insgesamt 1,3 Milliarden Euro blätterten die Münchner dafür hin. Außerdem unterhielt der Dax-Konzern mit mehreren Hundert Millionen Euro gefüllte schwarze Kassen in Österreich, Liechtenstein und der Schweiz und machte sich so der Geldwäsche schuldig. Aufsichtsratchef Heinrich von Pierer und Vorstandsvorsitzender Klaus Kleinfeld müssen ihren Hut nehmen. Der Skandal kostet Siemens rund 2,9 Milliarden Euro an Strafen, Steuernachzahlungen und Anwaltskosten. ## Platz 4: Deutsche Bank - dienstbar für Geldwäsche im großen Stil Wenn es um Skandale geht, darf die Deutsche Bank nicht fehlen. Jahrelang drückte sie gern ein Auge zu, wenn es um verdächtige Geldflüsse ging und musste in den USA und Großbritannien deshalb diverse Strafen begleichen: 2017 zahlte sie 630 Millionen US-Dollar, weil sie verdächtigen Geldflüssen aus Russland nicht nachgegangen war. Zusätzlich kam im selben Jahr noch eine Geldstrafe in Höhe von 41 Millionen US-Dollar dazu, weil sie Vorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Geldwäsche nicht eingehalten hatte. Dagegen ist die diesjährige Strafzahlung gar nicht so teuer: \"Nur\" 186 Millionen Dollar forderte die FED im Juli 2023 von der Bank - auch diesmal wegen ungenügender Maßnahmen gegen Geldwäsche. Es geht um die frühere Geschäftsbeziehung zur estnischen Tochter der Danske Bank. Die Danske Bank hatte in den Jahren 2008 bis 2016 diverse US-Banken betrogen und wurde in einem der größten US-Geldwäscheskandale zu einer Milliarden-Geldbuße verurteilt. Die Deutsche Bank wickelte verdächtige Transaktionen im Wert von mehr als 267 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Danske Bank ab. #### Platz 3: Volkswagen-Dieselbetrug – Größter Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte In der Motorsteuerung von wenigstens elf Millionen Fahrzeugen verbaute Volkswagen bis 2015 illegale Abschalteinrichtungen. Damit ist „Dieselgate“ der größte Industrieskandal der deutschen Geschichte und ein schamloser Betrug an Kunden und Behörden. Verwickelt in die kriminellen Machenschaften sind fast alle Marken des Konzerns sowie der Zulieferer Bosch. Die Konzerntochter Audi soll bei der Entwicklung der verbotenen Software eine Vorreiterrolle gespielt haben. Der Dieselbetrug kostete den langjährigen [VW](https://www.produktion.de/rohstoffe/schrott/georgsmarienhuette-und-vw-recyceln-schrott-gemeinsam-617.html)-Chef Martin Winterkorn den Job. Ein Strafverfahren wegen möglicher Marktmanipulation gegen VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess und Aufsichtsratschef Hans Dieter Pötsch wurde gegen eine Zahlung von neun Millionen Euro eingestellt. Rupert Stadler wurde wegen Betrugs zu einer Bewährungsstrafe von einem Jahr und neun Monaten sowie einem Bußgeld von 1,1 Millionen Euro verurteilt. ## Platz 2: Wirecard - spektakulärster Bilanzskandal der deutschen Wirtschaftsgeschichte An der Geschäftspraxis und den Bilanzzahlen des deutschen Fintech-Hoffnungsträgers Wirecard kamen schon mehr als ein Jahrzehnt vor der Insolvenz Zweifel auf, aber die Firma schaffte es trotzdem in den Dax. Im Jahr 2019 deckt ein Bericht der britischen Zeitung \\'Financial Times\\' Unregelmäßigkeiten bei Geschäften in Singapur auf. Nach einigem Hin und Her kam 2020 der jähe Absturz des Unternehmens, als klar wurde, dass auf Treuhandkonten 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlen. CEO Markus Braun trat zurück und wurde festgenommen, während Vorstandsmitglied Jan Marsalek unter einem Vorwand das Land verließ und die Flucht ergriff. Am 25. Juni 2020 meldete der Dax-Konzern Insolvenz an. Es stellte sich heraus, dass wesentliche Teile des Geschäfts tatsächlich nie stattgefunden hatten. Der damalige Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz geriet unter Druck, weil die ihm unterstellte Bafin trotz aller Hinweise wenig gegen den Zahlungsdienstleister unternommen hatte. 2022 begann der Strafprozess gegen Markus Braun, Oliver Bellenhaus und den ehemaligen Wirecard-Chefbuchhalter. Sie sind angeklagt wegen Marktmanipulation, Untreue, falscher Darstellung und gewerbsmäßigen Bandenbetrugs. Marsalek wäre sicherlich mit auf der Anklagebank, ist aber bis heute flüchtig und wird mit internationalem Haftbefehl gesucht. Im Juli 2023 meldete er sich mit einem Brief beim Landgericht München, welcher Braun entlasten sollte. Zeugenaussagen zeichneten im Prozess das Bild eines Konzerns, in dem es chaotisch zuging und der Vorstand kein besonderes Interesse an der Rechtstreue zeigte. Auch die Firmenkultur ließ wohl zu wünschen übrig: \"Pornografie war ganz normal bei uns\", gab ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter der internen Revision im Zeugenstand zu Protokoll. Brauns Anwälte versuchten unterdessen mit 450 Beweisanträgen zu belegen, dass Marsalek und Kronzeuge Bellenhaus sowie zahlreiche Mittäter die Schuld tragen, während Braun ahnungslos war. Ob sie das Gericht überzeugen können? Aktuell zeichnet sich erstmal eine Verlängerung der Verhandlung ab. Für diesen filmreifen Skandal gibt es hier im Ranking Platz 2. #### Platz 1: Cum-Ex-Skandal – Größter Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Die kriminelle Energie deutscher Banken und ihrer Anleger kennt keine Grenzen. Mit „Cum-Ex“- und „Cum-Cum“-Wertpapiertransaktionen zwischen mehreren Anlegern rundum den Dividendenstichtag einer Aktie verwirrten die Kreditinstitute von 2005 bis 2011 gezielt den Fiskus. So sehr, dass Finanzbeamte am Schluss nicht mehr erkennen konnten, welcher Bankkunde auf die Ausschüttung Kapitalertragsteuer gezahlt hatte, und welcher nicht. So konnten sich auch Anleger die Steuer zurückerstatten lassen, die sie gar nicht bezahlt hatten. Insgesamt prellten Banken und Aktionäre den deutschen Steuerzahler so um bis zu 32 Milliarden Euro – der größte Steuerbetrug in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik. *Überarbeitet von Julia Dusold und Dagmar Merger (14.08.2023)* ## Sie möchten gerne weiterlesen? ### Jetzt kostenlos registrieren oder einloggen: Newsletter-Anmeldung Bleiben Sie zu allen Themen, Trends und Innovationen der Branche informiert. ## Auch interessant ## Aktuelle Beiträge [Wirtschaft](https://www.produktion.de/wirtschaft.html) 15.

The investigation focuses on the bank’s handling of high-risk transactions, including correspondent banking relationships and the adequacy of its know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Key risk indicators cited include insufficient verification of beneficial ownership, inadequate screening of politically exposed persons (PEPs), and lapses in transaction monitoring that may have allowed suspicious activity reports (SARs) to go unfiled or delayed.\\n\\nRegulators have emphasized the seriousness of unresolved compliance deficiencies, with Danske Bank facing potential consent orders or settlements as part of enforcement actions. The bank’s responsiveness to these probes and the severity of any penalties imposed will significantly impact its risk profile. Past enforcement precedents in the sector suggest that failure to remediate AML/KYC gaps can lead to substantial fines and operational restrictions, underscoring the critical importance of robust sanctions compliance and real-time transaction oversight.\\n\\nAs Danske Bank navigates the regulatory landscape shaped by this money laundering inquiry, the institution’s ability to strengthen its AML controls and remediate identified weaknesses remains pivotal. The outcome of these enforcement actions will be closely watched as indicators of the bank’s commitment to regulatory compliance and risk mitigation in the evolving financial sector.',\n",
       "  'Danske Bank Under Scrutiny for Complex Money Laundering Patterns in Financial Transactions\\n\\nA detailed analysis uncovers suspicious layering techniques and anomalous cash flows linked to Danske Bank’s operations in the European banking sector.\\n\\nDanske Bank, a major financial institution operating primarily in Northern Europe, has been the subject of intense scrutiny regarding potential money laundering activities within its correspondent banking framework. Transaction monitoring data reveals a series of unusual counterparties and complex cash-flow patterns that suggest efforts to obscure beneficial ownership and circumvent standard know-your-customer (KYC) protocols. These patterns include rapid movement of funds through multiple jurisdictions and the use of politically exposed persons (PEPs) to mask illicit origins, raising red flags in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance reviews.\\n\\nTypical AML processes at Danske Bank involve stringent KYC checks, ongoing transaction monitoring, and the filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs) when anomalies are detected. However, forensic transaction analysis identifies layering techniques characterized by multiple, seemingly unrelated transfers designed to disrupt audit trails. The involvement of high-risk jurisdictions and shell entities as counterparties further complicates the detection of illicit flows. These indicators often trigger enhanced due diligence measures, yet the persistence of unusual cash flows points to potential gaps in enforcement or evasion tactics within Danske Bank’s AML framework.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have reportedly initiated probes into Danske Bank’s compliance with AML regulations, focusing on the adequacy of its transaction monitoring systems and the effectiveness of sanctions screening. Discussions of possible consent orders and settlement agreements have emerged, reflecting ongoing efforts to address identified vulnerabilities. Allegations include insufficient oversight of correspondent banking relationships and failure to timely report suspicious activities, which could result in significant fines and mandated remedial actions.\\n\\nDanske Bank remains at the center of concerns regarding its exposure to money laundering risks through complex transactional layering and questionable counterparties, underscoring the critical importance of robust AML controls and vigilant enforcement in the banking sector.',\n",

The bank’s governance structures and risk management frameworks have been questioned in light of alleged lapses that potentially enabled money laundering activities involving high-risk jurisdictions.\\n\\nKey AML and know-your-customer (KYC) processes such as enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (PEPs), beneficial ownership verification, and transaction monitoring appear to have suffered from inconsistent application and oversight. Suspicious activity reports (SARs) were reportedly delayed or inadequately filed, while controls over cross-border correspondent banking transactions lacked sufficient granularity to detect complex layering schemes. Furthermore, sanctions screening protocols and ongoing customer risk assessments did not consistently align with regulatory expectations, exposing Danske Bank to elevated compliance risks.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have initiated a probe into Danske Bank’s internal governance and control environment, focusing on whether systemic control breakdowns contributed to the facilitation of illicit funds. The bank is reportedly engaged in discussions regarding a potential consent order or settlement to address identified deficiencies. Enforcement agencies are emphasizing the need for robust remedial measures, including strengthened third-party oversight and enhanced transaction surveillance capabilities, to mitigate future operational risks.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s case underscores the critical importance of rigorous internal controls and governance mechanisms in preventing money laundering, highlighting how control failures and procedural gaps can undermine AML efforts within complex banking operations.',\n",

The bank’s operations in correspondent banking and cross-border transactions have come under particular focus, raising questions about the adequacy of its internal controls and compliance frameworks within a complex jurisdictional landscape.\\n\\nCentral to the controversy are Danske Bank’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, which reportedly failed to detect or prevent suspicious activity reports (SARs) involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) and entities with opaque beneficial ownership structures. Weaknesses in transaction monitoring and gaps in sanctions screening contributed to the prolonged exposure to illicit funds, underscoring systemic vulnerabilities in the bank’s risk management. The bank’s consent order and subsequent efforts to strengthen internal controls reflect an acknowledgment of these deficiencies, though media sentiment analysis suggests persistent skepticism about the effectiveness of remedial measures.\\n\\nRegulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions have led to high-profile investigations and discussions of potential settlements involving substantial fines. Danske Bank has faced allegations of inadequate oversight and failure to comply with AML regulations, prompting enforcement agencies to intensify their focus on the institution’s compliance culture. The ongoing nature of these probes, coupled with media coverage emphasizing the scale and duration of the laundering scheme, continues to fuel reputational risk and erode public confidence in the bank’s governance.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s ongoing challenge remains balancing remediation efforts with rebuilding stakeholder trust amid a complex web of allegations tied to money laundering, reflecting broader concerns about the institution’s commitment to robust AML and KYC standards.',\n",

The bank’s correspondent banking activities and retail operations reportedly involved complex ownership structures that obscured true beneficial owners, complicating efforts to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs) and sanctioned entities. These opaque arrangements raised red flags typically addressed through enhanced due diligence, yet Danske Bank’s transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting mechanisms appeared insufficient to detect or escalate high-risk profiles effectively.\\n\\nThe regulatory probe into Danske Bank’s compliance framework has highlighted gaps in sanctions screening and the management of PEP exposure, contributing to alleged facilitation of illicit financial flows. Authorities overseeing anti-money laundering enforcement have reportedly engaged in a consent order process, with potential settlement discussions addressing the bank’s lapses in KYC controls and AML program effectiveness. While exact penalties remain undisclosed, the investigation underscores systemic weaknesses in Danske Bank’s ability to maintain robust beneficial ownership verification and to file timely suspicious activity reports.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s case illustrates the critical importance of rigorous KYC and beneficial ownership transparency in preventing money laundering risks, emphasizing the need for intensified screening and transaction monitoring to uphold AML standards in the global banking sector.',\n",

The bank’s extensive correspondent relationships across multiple jurisdictions may challenge its ability to maintain robust know-your-customer (KYC) standards and effective transaction monitoring. Typical red flags in this context include complex beneficial ownership structures, politically exposed persons (PEPs) involvement, unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with customer profiles, and dealings with sanctioned entities or regions. These risk indicators require heightened due diligence and prompt suspicious activity reports (SARs) to regulators.\\n\\nRegulatory probes into Danske Bank’s AML framework could focus on whether the institution has adequately identified and mitigated risks inherent in its correspondent banking channels. Hypothetical enforcement actions may involve consent orders or settlements addressing alleged lapses in KYC compliance and transaction oversight, particularly in relation to cross-border exposures to high-risk jurisdictions. Such regulatory attention underscores the challenges faced by banks in balancing expansive international networks with stringent AML obligations and sanctions adherence.\\n\\nAs Danske Bank navigates the complexities of correspondent banking, the ongoing examination of its AML controls and cross-border exposure remains central to understanding potential vulnerabilities in its financial crime defenses.',\n",

The bank’s correspondent banking services have reportedly been exploited to facilitate illicit funds transfers, raising questions about the robustness of its internal controls within the banking sector.\\n\\nCentral to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance are rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, including thorough verification of beneficial ownership and enhanced due diligence for politically exposed persons (PEPs). Danske Bank’s transaction monitoring systems are expected to generate suspicious activity reports (SARs) when detecting anomalies or patterns indicative of money laundering. However, lapses in these processes—such as insufficient identification of high-risk clients or failure to flag complex cross-border transactions—may have contributed to regulatory concerns. The bank’s adherence to sanctions screening and ongoing customer consent orders also form critical components of its risk mitigation framework.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have initiated probes into Danske Bank’s AML controls, focusing on whether the institution adequately fulfilled its compliance obligations or whether systemic weaknesses allowed illicit activities to persist. The investigations include reviews of the bank’s SAR filings and the effectiveness of its correspondent banking oversight. Potential outcomes could involve settlements or consent orders imposing fines and mandating operational reforms. These enforcement actions underscore the importance of stringent consumer protection measures and data privacy safeguards, especially when financial crime investigations intersect with sensitive customer information.\\n\\nAs Danske Bank navigates these challenges, the core issue remains the intersection of criminal money laundering allegations with the bank’s responsibility to protect consumer data privacy and uphold regulatory standards designed to prevent financial abuse.',\n",

The bank’s correspondent banking network and cross-border transactions have been spotlighted for vulnerabilities that may enable the layering and integration stages of money laundering, particularly in jurisdictions with less stringent oversight.\\n\\nAML and KYC processes at Danske Bank are designed to detect suspicious activity through enhanced transaction monitoring and customer due diligence. However, typologies such as the use of opaque beneficial ownership structures and politically exposed persons (PEPs) have reportedly challenged the robustness of these controls. Indicators like rapid movement of funds through trade invoices, inconsistent documentation, and frequent changes in account ownership signal potential trade-based money laundering. Additionally, exploitation of shell companies with unclear economic purpose complicates the bank’s ability to file timely and effective suspicious activity reports (SARs).\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have hypothetically initiated probes into Danske Bank’s compliance frameworks, focusing on gaps in sanctions screening and KYC verification. The bank has faced consent orders and negotiated settlements in related jurisdictions, reflecting a heightened enforcement posture aimed at remedying systemic AML weaknesses. These regulatory actions underscore the ongoing challenges Danske Bank encounters in aligning its transaction monitoring systems with evolving laundering typologies and correspondent banking risks.\\n\\nDanske Bank’s experience illustrates the persistent challenge financial institutions face in addressing sophisticated money laundering schemes, emphasizing the need for continuous refinement of AML controls and heightened scrutiny of high-risk typologies within its operations.',\n",

The bank’s challenges appear rooted in weaknesses surrounding the oversight of third-party service providers, whose insufficient compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols may have facilitated illicit financial flows across multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\nCentral to Danske Bank’s AML framework are processes such as enhanced due diligence on beneficial ownership, politically exposed persons (PEP) screening, sanctions checks, and ongoing transaction monitoring. However, the involvement of external vendors in customer onboarding and suspicious activity reporting (SARs) has raised concerns about inconsistent application of these controls. Risk indicators including unusual transaction patterns, high-risk jurisdictions, and complex ownership structures were reportedly not adequately flagged or escalated, partially due to gaps in vendor management and insufficient real-time monitoring capabilities.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have launched probes into Danske Bank’s compliance failures, focusing on the bank’s reliance on third parties for critical AML functions. These investigations have resulted in consent orders and settlement discussions, with allegations centering on inadequate oversight of correspondent banking channels and failure to report suspicious activities promptly.

      "**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n",
      "\n",
      "Danske Bank has been implicated in one of the largest money laundering scandals in European history, with over €200 billion in suspicious funds processed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The bank has admitted guilt, faced criminal convictions, and paid fines totaling over €2.5 billion across multiple jurisdictions, including the US, Denmark, France, and Estonia. The violations were systemic, spanning nearly a decade, and involved failures in AML controls, client due diligence, and transaction monitoring. While major settlements have been reached and executive resignations have occurred, ongoing investigations and recent fines indicate that the risk is not fully resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total Fines Paid Calculation:**\n",
      "- €470 million (2024-11-18)\n",
      "- $2 million (2025-08-29) ≈ €1.85 million (at $1 = €0.925)\n",
      "- Over $2 billion (2025-06-20) ≈ €1.85 billion\n",
      "- €6,028,799 + €300,000 = €6.33 million (2025-05-27)\n",
      "- $50 million (2025-10-08) ≈ €46.25 million\n",
      "- €6.3 million (2024-09-18) [French settlement]\n",
      "- Additional fines referenced but not quantified (hundreds of millions, billion-dollar fine, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total (rounded, using largest confirmed numbers and avoiding double-counting):**\n",
      "- €470 million + €1.85 billion + €6.33 million + €1.85 million + €46.25 million + €6.3 million = **€2,380,730,000** (approx. €2.38 billion)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Nature:** Systemic money laundering through Estonian branch (2007–2015), with €200+ billion in suspicious transactions, mainly from Russian clients.\n",
      "- **Criminal Conviction:** Admitted guilt to conspiracy to commit bank fraud (2024-07-11).\n",
      "- **Regulatory Failures:** Inadequate AML controls, poor client due diligence, and failure to act on warnings (e.g., from Central Bank of Russia in 2013).\n",
      "- **Leadership Accountability:** CEO and key executives resigned; Estonian branch closed in 2019.\n",
      "- **Jurisdictions:** Denmark, Estonia, US, UK, France, and broader EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. CURRENT STATUS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Resolved:** Major settlements with US, Danish, and French authorities; Estonian branch closed; executive resignations.\n",
      "- **Ongoing:** Investigations by Danish, Estonian, US, and UK authorities (as of 2025-06-20); recent fines (2025-08-29, 2025-10-08) indicate continued regulatory scrutiny.\n",
      "- **Geographic Spread:** Multi-jurisdictional (EU, US, Russia, Baltics).\n",
      "- **Recent Activity:** Fines and settlements as recent as October 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. TRAJECTORY**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pattern:** Repeated, large-scale violations over many years; fines and settlements continue into 2025.\n",
      "- **Improvement:** Some evidence of reform (branch closure, leadership change, settlements), but ongoing investigations and recent fines suggest risk remains elevated.\n",
      "- **Quote:** \"Danske Bank was fined over $2 billion by US authorities in 2022 as a result of an investigation into its Estonian branch's involvement in processing suspicious transactions for high-risk clients through the US financial system.\" (2025-06-20)\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. RISK RATING**\n",
      "\n",
      "**HIGH**  \n",
      "- Justification: Systemic, multi-year, multi-jurisdictional AML failures; total fines exceed €2 billion; ongoing investigations; recent fines; criminal conviction; pattern of repeated violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. PARTNERSHIP RECOMMENDATION**\n",
      "\n",
      "**AVOID PARTNERSHIP**  \n",
      "- Rationale: Ongoing criminal and regulatory investigations, unresolved risk, and a pattern of systemic AML failures with recent enforcement actions. The scale and recency of violations, combined with the magnitude of fines and multi-jurisdictional scrutiny, indicate that Danske Bank remains a high-risk partner for AML compliance.\n",
