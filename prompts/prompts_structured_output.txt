[ {"url_summary_prompt":" You are analyzing RAW CONTENT extracted from web source to determine if it contains financial crime/compliance information.
Target entity: "{entity_name}"

TASK 1 - EXTRACT DATE (date_published field):
Find the publication date or event date in the content:
- Look for: publication date, article date, press release date, or event date
- Format as: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., "2023-05-15")
- If multiple dates exist, prefer the publication date over event dates
- If no clear date is found, use: "Unknown"
- Common date locations: header, byline, footer, or first paragraph

TASK 2 - CLASSIFY (claim_type field):
Determine the PRIMARY claim type from the content:
- allegation: Unproven accusations or allegations of wrongdoing
- investigation: Active investigations, probes, or inquiries  
- charge: Formal criminal or civil charges filed
- conviction: Guilty verdicts, convictions, or findings of liability
- plea: Plea agreements, admissions, or guilty pleas
- fine: Monetary penalties, fines, or financial sanctions imposed
- settlement: Settlements, resolved cases, or negotiated agreements
- clearance: Exonerations, dismissals, or cases dropped/closed without findings
- sanction_listing: Sanctions designations, blacklisting, or regulatory listings
- other: Content has no financial crime information OR doesn't fit categories above

TASK 3 - SUMMARIZE (summary field):
Write a detailed factual summary of financial crime/compliance information found in the content.

SCOPE - Include ONLY if explicitly mentioned:
- AML/KYC/transaction monitoring deficiencies or failures
- Money laundering allegations, investigations, charges, or convictions
- Sanctions violations or sanctions-related issues
- Fraud, corruption, bribery, or embezzlement
- Tax evasion or tax-related crimes
- Securities violations or market manipulation
- Regulatory fines, penalties, or enforcement actions
- Court proceedings, settlements, or legal outcomes
- Compliance program failures or remediation efforts

TASK 4 - Assess Severity Level of news in text, assign value to (severity_level field)
Level_5 — Criminal findings or active sanctions listing (OFAC/EU/UK) or explicit criminal charges/convictions for ML.
Level_4 — Civil/administrative enforcement: official findings of AML/control failures, fines, consent orders/DPAs, independent monitor required.
Level_3 — Formal regulatory interest: confirmed inquiry, subpoena, dawn raid, or “under investigation” status (no findings yet).
Level_2 — Soft signals only: media/NGO allegations, civil lawsuits without regulator action, rumors, old isolated incidents.
Level_1 — No signal / Cleared: no credible AML mentions, prior inquiry formally closed/cleared, clean regulator checks.

Tie-breakers & rules for severity level
If multiple apply, choose the highest level.
Any active sanctions ⇒ Level_5.
Any formal investigation (even without findings) ⇒ at least Level_3.
Any civil enforcement/fine/monitor ⇒ Level_4.
If the only evidence is a formal clearance/closure, and no other adverse items ⇒ Level_1


OVERALL RULES:
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in RAW CONTENT - no inference or external knowledge
- Always mention "{entity_name}" in the summary if the entity appears in the content
- Include specific details: amounts, timeframes, jurisdictions, allegations, outcomes, remedial actions
- If content has NO financial crime/compliance information, write: "No financial crime or compliance information is present in the content."
- Summary can be multiple sentences if needed to capture important details
- RAW CONTENT may include boilerplate (menus/footers/headers), duplicated blocks, and unrelated 
    text—ignore such noise and extract/classify only substantive financial-crime content.

Remember: Extract ALL three fields. Focus on factual content from the text only.

{"journalist_instructions" :"

You are creating exactly {max_journalists} AI journalist personas to analyze 
the SAME financial-crime topic from DIFFERENT, NON-OVERLAPPING angles for banking risk assessment.

Topic under investigation: {crime_topic}
Goal: Create persona of journalist which has solid experience in writing articles which occuses company over involement in  {crime_topic}.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
- Return ONLY a valid HydePerspectives object with exactly {max_journalists} journalists.
- Each journalist has exactly these fields:
  - expertise (short phrase)
  - perspective (2-3 sentences)
  - style (6-10 adjectives/descriptors, comma-separated)
- No extra commentary, headings, or prose.

For each journalist:
- expertise: Their specific risk assessment specialization
- perspective: From what perspective they asses the impact of crime over diffenret economical or social aspects
- style: Their analytical approach to uncovering risks relevant to banking partnerships

UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
- Pairwise distinct expertise (not just synonyms; avoid generic labels like “risk analyst”).
- Pairwise distinct perspectives (each must emphasize different indicators/decision criteria).
- style must contain 3–6 tokens; at least TWO tokens must be unique to that persona (not used by any other persona).
- Before returning, self-check all pairs. If any two personas substantially overlap in expertise keywords OR share >50% of style tokens OR rephrase the same perspective, REVISE and re-check.

COVERAGE & DIVERSITY (GUIDANCE, THEN ENFORCE UNIQUENESS)
- Distribute personas across different risk axes. Draw from (but are not limited to):
  • Regulatory/Enforcement (sanctions, consent orders, investigations)
  • Financial/Forensic flows (counterparties, anomalies)
  • Operational/Governance/TPRM (controls, third parties, processes)
  • Reputational/Media/Stakeholders (controversy persistence, sentiment)
  • KYC/AML/BO/PEP/Sanctions screening (beneficial ownership transparency)
  • Data privacy/consumer protection
  
- If {max_journalists} ≥ 5, ensure at least one persona implicitly covers each of these example 
  archetypes (use them as inspiration; do NOT output role names, reflect them via fields only):
  1) Regulatory Compliance Analyst — statutory/enforcement exposure
  2) Financial Due Diligence Investigator — flows/counterparties/anomalies
  3) Operational Risk Assessor — governance/controls/third-party risk
  4) Reputational Risk Evaluator — media patterns/controversy persistence
  5) KYC/AML Specialist — KYC gaps/BO transparency/PEP & sanctions
- If {max_journalists} < 5, prioritize coverage in this order: KYC/AML → Regulatory → Financial.

FIELD WRITING RULES
- expertise: one crisp, specific phrase tied to the angle (no generic titles).
- perspective: 1–2 sentences listing the key indicators/thresholds/heuristics used to decide on partnership risk (e.g., “weights unresolved consent orders more than remedial plans”).
- style: 3–6 concise descriptors shaping tone/approach (e.g., “forensic, evidence-driven, regulation-centric, conservative”). Ensure ≥2 tokens unique to this persona.

Return ONLY the HydePerspectives object with exactly {max_journalists} journalists."
