You are creating exactly {max_journalists} AI journalist personas to analyze 
the SAME financial-crime topic from DIFFERENT, NON-OVERLAPPING angles for banking risk assessment.

Topic under investigation: {crime_topic}
Goal: Create persona of journalist which has solid experience in writing articles which occuses company over involement in  {crime_topic}.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
- Return ONLY a valid HydePerspectives object with exactly {max_journalists} journalists.
- Each journalist has exactly these fields:
  - expertise (short phrase)
  - perspective (2-3 sentences)
  - style (6-10 adjectives/descriptors, comma-separated)
- No extra commentary, headings, or prose.

For each journalist:
- expertise: Their specific risk assessment specialization
- perspective: From what perspective they asses the impact of crime over diffenret economical or social aspects
- style: Their analytical approach to uncovering risks relevant to banking partnerships

UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
- Pairwise distinct expertise (not just synonyms; avoid generic labels like “risk analyst”).
- Pairwise distinct perspectives (each must emphasize different indicators/decision criteria).
- style must contain 3–6 tokens; at least TWO tokens must be unique to that persona (not used by any other persona).
- Before returning, self-check all pairs. If any two personas substantially overlap in expertise keywords OR share >50% of style tokens OR rephrase the same perspective, REVISE and re-check.

COVERAGE & DIVERSITY (GUIDANCE, THEN ENFORCE UNIQUENESS)
- Distribute personas across different risk axes. Draw from (but are not limited to):
  • Regulatory/Enforcement (sanctions, consent orders, investigations)
  • Financial/Forensic flows (counterparties, anomalies)
  • Operational/Governance/TPRM (controls, third parties, processes)
  • Reputational/Media/Stakeholders (controversy persistence, sentiment)
  • KYC/AML/BO/PEP/Sanctions screening (beneficial ownership transparency)
  • Data privacy/consumer protection
  
- If {max_journalists} ≥ 5, ensure at least one persona implicitly covers each of these example 
  archetypes (use them as inspiration; do NOT output role names, reflect them via fields only):
  1) Regulatory Compliance Analyst — statutory/enforcement exposure
  2) Financial Due Diligence Investigator — flows/counterparties/anomalies
  3) Operational Risk Assessor — governance/controls/third-party risk
  4) Reputational Risk Evaluator — media patterns/controversy persistence
  5) KYC/AML Specialist — KYC gaps/BO transparency/PEP & sanctions
- If {max_journalists} < 5, prioritize coverage in this order: KYC/AML → Regulatory → Financial.

FIELD WRITING RULES
- expertise: one crisp, specific phrase tied to the angle (no generic titles).
- perspective: 1–2 sentences listing the key indicators/thresholds/heuristics used to decide on partnership risk (e.g., weights unresolved consent orders more than remedial plans”).
- style: 3–6 concise descriptors shaping tone/approach (e.g., forensic, evidence-driven, regulation-centric, conservative). Ensure ≥2 tokens unique to this persona.

Return ONLY the HydePerspectives object with exactly {max_journalists} journalists."
