You are analyzing RAW CONTENT extracted by Tavily to determine if it contains financial crime/compliance information.
Target entity: {entity_name}

TASK 1 - EXTRACT DATE (date_published field):
Find the publication date or event date in the content:
- Look for: publication date, article date, press release date, or event date
- Format as: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2023-05-15)
- If multiple dates exist, prefer the publication date over event dates
- If no clear date is found, use: Unknown
- Common date locations: header, byline, footer, or first paragraph

TASK 2 - CLASSIFY (claim_type field):
Determine the PRIMARY claim type from the content:
- allegation: Unproven accusations or allegations of wrongdoing
- investigation: Active investigations, probes, or inquiries  
- charge: Formal criminal or civil charges filed
- conviction: Guilty verdicts, convictions, or findings of liability
- plea: Plea agreements, admissions, or guilty pleas
- fine: Monetary penalties, fines, or financial sanctions imposed
- settlement: Settlements, resolved cases, or negotiated agreements
- clearance: Exonerations, dismissals, or cases dropped/closed without findings
- sanction_listing: Sanctions designations, blacklisting, or regulatory listings
- other: Content has no financial crime information OR doesn't fit categories above

TASK 3 - SUMMARIZE (summary field):
Write a detailed factual summary of financial crime/compliance information found in the content.

SCOPE - Include ONLY if explicitly mentioned:
- AML/KYC/transaction monitoring deficiencies or failures
- Money laundering allegations, investigations, charges, or convictions
- Sanctions violations or sanctions-related issues
- Fraud, corruption, bribery, or embezzlement
- Tax evasion or tax-related crimes
- Securities violations or market manipulation
- Regulatory fines, penalties, or enforcement actions
- Court proceedings, settlements, or legal outcomes
- Compliance program failures or remediation efforts

TASK 4 - Assess Severity Level of news in text, assign value to (severity_level field)
Level_5 — Criminal findings or active sanctions listing (OFAC/EU/UK) or explicit criminal charges/convictions for ML.
Level_4 — Civil/administrative enforcement: official findings of AML/control failures, fines, consent orders/DPAs, independent monitor required.
Level_3 — Formal regulatory interest: confirmed inquiry, subpoena, dawn raid, or “under investigation” status (no findings yet).
Level_2 — Soft signals only: media/NGO allegations, civil lawsuits without regulator action, rumors, old isolated incidents.
Level_1 — No signal / Cleared: no credible AML mentions, prior inquiry formally closed/cleared, clean regulator checks.

Tie-breakers & rules for severity level
If multiple apply, choose the highest level.
Any active sanctions ⇒ Level_5.
Any formal investigation (even without findings) ⇒ at least Level_3.
Any civil enforcement/fine/monitor ⇒ Level_4.
If the only evidence is a formal clearance/closure, and no other adverse items ⇒ Level_1


OVERALL RULES:
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in RAW CONTENT - no inference or external knowledge
- Always mention {entity_name} in the summary if the entity appears in the content
- Include specific details: amounts, timeframes, jurisdictions, allegations, outcomes, remedial actions
- If content has NO financial crime/compliance information, write: No financial crime or compliance information is present in the content.
- Summary can be multiple sentences if needed to capture important details
- RAW CONTENT may include boilerplate (menus/footers/headers), duplicated blocks, and unrelated 
    text—ignore such noise and extract/classify only substantive financial-crime content.

Remember: Extract ALL three fields. Focus on factual content from the text only."
