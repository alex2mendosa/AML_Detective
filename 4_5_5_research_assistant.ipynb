None of these cases are founded on monetary claims against Danube SRL or the company’s ability to manage its day-to-day business affairs, but revolve around a personal claim of Bemol Retail SRL, a third party, on a former general manager of Bemol.\\n\\n[![Image 9: Footer Logo Alternative Text](https://www.ebrd.com/content/dam/ebrd_dxp/background-images/ebrd-regular.svg)](https://www.ebrd.com/home.html)\\n\\n[Engage with us](https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/news/2023/ebrd-will-appeal-imposed-external-administration-of-assets-of-moldovas-danube-logistics-srl.html \"Engage with us\")\\n\\n*   [Comment on proposals](https://www.ebrd.com/home/comment-on-proposal.html \"visit page about ebrd proposals and opportunity to comment\")\\n*   [Report fraud, corruption and misconduct](https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/strategies-governance-compliance/office-chief-compliance-officer/report-fraud-corruption-prohibited-practices.html \"visit page about reporting fraud and corruption\")\\n*   [Submit environmental or social complaint](https://www.ebrd.com/home/what-we-do/projects/independent-project-accountability-mechanism.html \"visit ebrd project accountability page\")\\n\\n[Contact us](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts.html \"visit page about contacting the EBRD\")\\n\\n*   [Request for information](https://www.ebrd.com/home/forms/information-request.html \"visit form for requesting information about ebrd\")\\n*   [A-Z contacts list](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts/ebrd-contacts-list.html \"visit page of full A-Z contacts for the ebrd\")\\n*   [Media enquiries](https://www.ebrd.com/home/contacts/ebrd-media-enquiries.html \"visit page about media enquiries\")\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   [Cookie Policy](https://www.ebrd.com/home/cookie-policy.html \"click to view information on website cookie policy\")\\n*   [Site map](https://www.ebrd.com/home/site-map.html \"click to view ebrd sitemap\")\\n*   [Terms and conditions](https://www.ebrd.com/home/terms-and-conditions.html \"click to view terms and conditions of website\")\\n*   [Access to Information Policy](https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/strategies-governance-compliance/access-to-information-policy.html \"visit page about ebrd access to information policy\")\\n\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/ebrdhq \"Visit EBRD page on Facebook (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://x.com/ebrd \"Visit EBRD page on X (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/ebrd_official/ \"Visit EBRD page on Instagram (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/ebrdtv \"Visit EBRD page on YouTube (opens in new window)\")\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ebrd/ \"Visit EBRD page on Linkedin (opens in new window)\")\\n\\nCookie consent\\n\\nCookies are pieces of code used to track website usage and give audiences the best possible experience.

    "- Press updates or multiple articles about the **same** order/filing/decision belong to the **same cluster**.\n",
    "- If there is a **material difference** (e.g., different regulator/agency, different amount/currency, different case number or court, clearly different event dates), treat as **separate clusters** even if wording is similar.\n",

    "   - regulator/agency/court names\n",

    "\n",
    "2) For each cluster, output ONE `EvidenceClaim`:\n",
    "   - `claim_text`: One precise sentence for {state[\"entity_name\"]} capturing shared details (amounts, agency, timeframe, jurisdiction). If sources conflict on a detail, omit that detail rather than guessing.\n",
    "   - `claim_type`: COPY from the clustered items (do not change).\n",
    "   - `supporting_urls`: ALL unique URLs from the cluster. Deduplicate. Order by descending `hyde_score`; if scores tie or are missing, preserve first appearance.\n",
    "   - `date_publish`: choose in this order:\n",
    "       a) A clear event date in the summaries (YYYY-MM-DD).\n",

    "    - Determine if violations were systemic or isolated\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. CURRENT RISK STATUS\n",
    "    - Count active investigations (ongoing = unresolved risk)\n",
    "    - Identify investigating authorities \n",
    "    - Assess geographic spread (multiple jurisdictions = higher risk)\n",
    "    - Evaluate timeline and provide quote with date in ISO 8601 format (recent violations = weak current controls)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n",
    "    - Evaluate settlement efforts (genuine improvement vs PR)\n",
    "    - Check for leadership accountability (executives resigned?)\n",
    "    - Assess system improvements (new AML systems, training?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. PATTERN RECOGNITION\n",
    "    - Multiple fines for similar issues = poor compliance culture\n",
    "    - Repeated violations across years = systemic failure\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\\n\\nLukoil is currently subject to U.S. sanctions, with a notable enforcement action involving the seizure of a $45 million aircraft by U.S. authorities in 2022. There is no evidence of fines paid to date, but the scale of the asset seizure and ongoing sanction status indicate unresolved and significant compliance risk. The most serious issue is the violation of U.S. sanctions and export controls, directly tied to Russia, with potential regional impacts extending to Romania and Moldova. The risk is ongoing, as evidenced by recent references to sanctions as of 2025.\\n\\n**VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\\n\\n- **What They Did Wrong:**  \\n  Lukoil violated U.S. sanctions and export controls related to Russia, resulting in a federal warrant for the seizure of a $45 million aircraft (Boeing 737-7EM) on August 31, 2022.  \\n- **When:**  \\n  The aircraft seizure occurred in September 2022.  \\n  Lukoil remains subject to U.S. sanctions as of November 2025, with regional implications for fuel supply in Romania and Moldova.\\n\\n**CURRENT STATUS**\\n\\n- **Resolved vs Ongoing:**  \\n  The asset seizure is a resolved enforcement action, but the underlying sanctions and export control violations are ongoing.  \\n- **Active Investigations:**  \\n  Lukoil remains under U.S. sanctions, with no evidence of settlement or resolution.  \\n- **Investigating Authorities:**  \\n  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas; U.S. government (sanctions enforcement).  \\n- **Geographic Spread:**  \\n  U.S. jurisdiction, with secondary effects in Romania and Moldova.\\n\\n**TRAJECTORY**\\n\\n- **Getting Better or Worse:**  \\n  The risk is persistent and possibly worsening, as Lukoil remains subject to sanctions as of 2025-11-08.

În cadrul lui, pe 7 august, ei au făcut 78 de percheziții și au reținut două persoane, care sunt judecate pentru acțiuni similare, la Soroca. Pe 8 august, Inspectoratul General al Poliției (IGP) a anunțat că deține probe care confirmă că un grup de persoane se pregătea să corupă votanți la alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie. Oamenii legii spun că persoanele vizate în investigații acționau în beneficiul organizației criminale a oligarhului fugar Ilan Șor. Poliția a publicat și interceptări audio, în care se aude că oamenii care vor lucra cu alegătorii în interesul „echipei lui Ilan Șor” vor primi „bonusuri pentru incomodități”. Persoana care vorbește instruiește o alta că, la fiecare acuzație că Ilan Șor este un infractor, să răspundă că el, de fapt, are grijă de oameni și le oferă pensionarilor cte 2.000 de lei. ## **Bani din Rusia și indicații pe Telegram** Poliția susține că oamenii la care au avut loc perchezițiile transferau și distribuiau bani de proveniență dubioasă, obținuți prin intermediul aplicației mobile PSB a băncii rusești Promsviazbank. În cadrul investigațiilor, s-a stabilit că reprezentanții organizației criminale instalează în telefoanele cetățenilor aplicația „Taito”, care funcționează similar aplicației PSB, utilizate pentru cumpărarea voturilor la alegerile prezidențiale din 2024. De asemenea, prin Taito și Telegram, persoanele vizate primeau indicații de la „curatorii din Federația Rusă”, inclusiv sarcini de a distribui și a comenta link-uri cu videoclipuri de dezinformare pe rețelele de socializare. În capturile de ecran publicate de IGP, se vede cum simpatizanții blocului politic „Victorie”, condus de Ilan Șor, au fost invitați la un curs despre cum ar trebui să se comporte activiștii dacă se întlnesc cu Poliția. În urma perchezițiilor, oamenii legii au ridicat mai multe arme deținute ilegal, telefoane mobile, laptopuri, documente bancare, carduri Pyypl și înscrisuri „care demonstrează activitatea infracțională a grupării”. Poliția spune că investigațiile vor continua pentru a atrage la răspundere penală toate persoanele implicate. 📰 **Europa Liberă Moldova este și pe Google News.** [**Abonează-te**](http://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEBK2nJhSrsXQ-VLldxYIX7UqFAgKIhAStpyYUq7F0PlS5XcWCF-1) * #### [Nadejda Coptu](/author/nadejda-coptu/rtikqo) La Europa Liberă Moldova scriu despre justiție.

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897). [For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list). See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

Peste 40 de percheziții au avut loc simultan la domiciliile suspecților și la sediile unor firme din Chișinău. Persoanele vizate sunt bănuite că ar fi implicate într-o rețea de contrabandă cu tutun, spălare de bani și migrație ilegală.** Potrivit unui comunicat al PCCOCS, rețeaua a fost monitorizată timp de aproximativ un an, perioadă în care au fost adunate probe privind o activitate infracțională desfășurată la scară largă. Investigațiile au scos la iveală un mecanism bine pus la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol clar în lanțul de producție, transport și distribuție a țigaretelor contrafăcute. Printre cei implicați se numără administratori ai unor companii comerciale care erau folosite drept paravan pentru acțiuni ilegale, în special transportul de tutun și țigări în Uniunea Europeană. Un cetățean moldovean avea un rol-cheie în rețea: se ocupa de recrutarea forței de muncă, în special lucrători din rândul cetățenilor cazaci, greci, bulgari și ucraineni, care erau transportați în fabrici clandestine din Europa. Banii obținuți din activitățile ilegale erau trecuți printr-o schemă complexă: erau reinvestiți în bunuri mobile și imobile, dar și în afaceri cu aparență de legalitate din Republica Moldova. Suma totală introdusă în economia națională este considerată de proporții deosebit de mari, arată anchetatorii. În urma perchezițiilor, au fost ridicate automobile de lux, peste 25.000 de euro, mii de dolari, pachete de țigări suspecte a fi contrafăcute (cu aceleași coduri unice ca cele găsite anterior în Italia), tehnică de calcul, telefoane, carduri bancare, planuri scrise manual, dar și ștampile ale unor companii și instituții. De asemenea, au fost depistate și arme de foc deținute ilegal, păstrate în condiții contrare legii. Video Player is loading.

Anchetatorii au reușit să identifice întregul cerc de persoane implicate în gruparea criminală. Fiecare membru avea sarcini precise, iar activitatea era desfășurată ierarhic, într-o structură bine organizată. Organizatorul rețelei, un bărbat de 39 de ani, a fost reținut pentru 72 de ore. Acesta ar fi coordonat recrutarea muncitorilor din Moldova și Ucraina, achiziția și transportul utilajelor, precum și toate activitățile logistice și administrative ale rețelei. Cercetările sunt în desfășurare pentru a stabili întreaga arie de implicare și tragerea la răspundere a tuturor persoanelor implicate. Suspecții beneficiază, până la o eventuală condamnare definitivă, de toate drepturile procesuale, inclusiv de prezumția de nevinovăție. Totodată, în cadrul investigațiilor au apărut și indicii privind implicarea rețelei în migrație ilegală, aspect care urmează să fie cercetat separat. De asemenea, urmează să fie deschis un dosar penal și pentru păstrarea și comercializarea ilegală a armelor și munițiilor. ![Image 33](https://tv8.md/resources/2023/09/22/76349299-fc63-4adb-9c88-371c26e379ef_LogoTV8.png) [Redacția TV8](https://tv8.md/author/redac%C8%9Bia-tv-8) ![Image 34](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/mailLight.svg) ![Image 35](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/messengerOriginal.svg)![Image 36: Facebook](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/facebookOriginal.svg)![Image 37](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/twitterOriginal_2.svg)![Image 38: Telegram](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/telegramOriginal.svg)![Image 39](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/viber.svg) Cutia Neagră PLUS Știri cu Angela Gonța Cutia Neagră Întreabă Ghețu Новая неделя Verde-n ochi Alo, TV8 Iubește viața Psihologul meu Campionii Vania Băț News Show Итоги Недели c Ириной Стряпко Новости с Яной Степаненко Business UP Dosarele X Новости с Ириной Стряпко Sinteza săptămânii Secretul banilor Foc la Ghete! ###### Cutia Neagră PLUS: Patronii lui Usatîi Partidul Nostru al lui Renato Usatii a fost lider la Parlamentare la donații primite de la pensionari și șomeri.

Potrivit unui comunicat al poliției, primul suspect, un bărbat de 34 de ani din Chișinău, a fost reținut în timp ce conducea autoturismul în care transporta aproximativ 2,5 kilograme de marijuana și hașiș, drogurile fiind împărțite în 140 de pliculețe care ar fi fost pregătite pentru vânzare în Bălți. Ulterior, poliția l-a reținut și pe al doilea bănuit, un tânăr de 25 de ani din Chișinău, de la care, potrivit anchetatorilor, primul suspect ar fi obținut drogurile. Cei doi suspecți ar face parte dintr-un grup infracțional care comercializa droguri atât în municipiu, cât și în Telenești și în raioanele învecinate, prin comenzi primite de la clienți pe aplicația Telegram. De asemenea, grupul ar fi fost în curs de extindere și căuta alți complici - „dealeri” - pentru a-și spori activitatea de vânzare a drogurilor. În urma opririi autoturismului și confiscării drogurilor, șoferul suspect a fost supus examinării medicale, care a confirmat că se afla la volan sub influența marijuanei și a cocainei. La cererea procurorilor, primul suspect a fost plasat în arest preventiv, iar mașina sa a fost ridicată pentru trafic de droguri și va fi confiscată. Al doilea reținut este acuzat de complicitate la trafic de droguri, iar ancheta continuă pentru identificarea altor membri ai grupului. ![Image 85](https://tv8.md/resources/2023/09/22/76349299-fc63-4adb-9c88-371c26e379ef_LogoTV8.png) [Redacția TV8](https://tv8.md/author/redac%C8%9Bia-tv-8) ![Image 86](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/mailLight.svg) ![Image 87](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/messengerOriginal.svg)![Image 88: Facebook](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/facebookOriginal.svg)![Image 89](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/twitterOriginal_2.svg)![Image 90: Telegram](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/telegramOriginal.svg)![Image 91](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/viber.svg) Cutia Neagră PLUS Știri cu Angela Gonța Cutia Neagră Întreabă Ghețu Новая неделя Verde-n ochi Alo, TV8 Iubește viața Psihologul meu Campionii Vania Băț News Show Итоги Недели c Ириной Стряпко Новости с Яной Степаненко Business UP Dosarele X Новости с Ириной Стряпко Sinteza săptămânii Secretul banilor Foc la Ghete! ###### O adolescentă de 13 ani din capitală a fost găsită moartă în incinta clădirii abandonate a fostului Hotel Național.

September 1, 2022 Houston, TX, United States Counter Proliferation Investigation Unit, National Security US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners ================================================================================================================================== [![Image 13: US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners](https://www.ice.gov/assets/news/2022/220901USAO.png)](https://www.ice.gov/assets/news/2022/220901USAO.png \"US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners\") HOUSTON - The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a warrant Aug. 31 for the U.S. to seize a $45 million aircraft owned by a Russian multinational oil and gas corporation following an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston, FBI Houston, and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security into alleged violations of sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

The investigation found probable cause that LUKOIL violated U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, specifically export controls and license requirements related to U.S.-manufactured aircraft. The aircraft, owned by LUKOIL and identified by tail number VP-CLR and serial number 34865, was found to have flown into and out of Russia in violation of these sanctions. The ownership of the aircraft was obscured through a series of shell companies. LUKOIL has been subject to sectoral sanctions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control since September 2014. The seizure action is coordinated through the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, which enforces sanctions and export controls against Russia. The investigation into additional aircraft remains ongoing.', claim_type='sanction_listing', date_published='2022-09-01', hyde_score=0.35)],\n",

[Press Releases](/news/press-releases) Press Releases ## Treasury Sanctions Members of the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Evil Corp in Tri-Lateral Action with the United Kingdom and Australia *The United States takes additional action against the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, identifying and sanctioning additional members and affiliates* WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating seven individuals and two entities associated with the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, in a tri-lateral action with the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). On December 5, 2019, OFAC designated Evil Corp, its leader and founder Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets and over a dozen Evil Corp members, facilitators, and affiliated companies pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757 (“E.O. 13694, as amended”). The United Kingdom and Australia are concurrently designating select Evil Corp-affiliated individuals designated by OFAC today or in 2019. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment charging one Evil Corp member in connection with his use of BitPaymer ransomware targeting victims in the United States. Today’s designation also coincides with the second day of the U.S.-hosted Counter Ransomware Initiative summit which involves over 50 countries working together to counter the threat of ransomware. “Today’s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,” said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. “The United States, in close coordination with our allies and partners, including through the Counter Ransomware Initiative, will continue to expose and disrupt the criminal networks that seek personal profit from the pain and suffering of their victims.” Evil Corp is a Russia-based cybercriminal organization responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware. Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers. In a concurrent action with OFAC’s December 2019 sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Maksim and Evil Corp administrator Igor Turashev on criminal charges related to computer hacking and bank fraud schemes, and the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program issued a reward for information of up to $5 million leading to the capture and/or conviction of Maksim. Additionally, Maksim used his employment at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK) as cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp. The NIK was established by Igor Yuryevich Chayka (Chayka), son of Russian Security Council member Yuriy Chayka, and his associate Aleksei Valeryavich Troshin (Troshin). In October 2022, OFAC designated Chayka, Troshin, and NIK pursuant to E.O. 14024. ### Evil Corp Members and Affiliates ### [Click to Enlarge](/system/files/136/jy2623-figure1.png) **Eduard Benderskiy** (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp’s leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp’s relationship with the Russian state. Benderskiy leveraged his status and contacts to facilitate Evil Corp’s developing relationships with officials of the Russian intelligence services. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group. While he has no official position in the Russian government, Benderskiy portrays himself as an aide to the Russian Duma. Around 2017, one of Benderskiy’s private security firms was involved in providing security for Iraq-based facilities operated by the Russian oil company Lukoil OAO. This same private security firm has been lauded by the FSB, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Duma, and other Russian government bodies. From at least 2016, Maksim had business interactions with Aleksandr Tikhonov (Tikhonov), former commander of the FSB Special purpose Center, Russian government leaders, including OFAC-designated persons Dmitry Kozak (Kozak) and Gleb Khor, and leaders of prominent Russian banks like OFAC-designated person Herman Gref (Gref), the Chief Executive Officer of Sberbank. In 2019, Benderskiy used his connections to facilitate a business deal that included Maksim and Kozak, which they believed would earn tens of millions of dollars per month. In the same year, Benderskiy hosted a meeting with Maksim and Gref to discuss business contracts with NIK. After the December 2019 sanctions and indictments against Evil Corp and Maksim, Maksim sought out Benderskiy’s guidance. Benderskiy used his extensive influence to protect the group, including his son-in-law, both by providing senior members with security and by ensuring they were not pursued by Russian internal authorities. OFAC designated Benderskiy pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation, and pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Maksim, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Benderskiy is the general director, founder, and 100 percent owner of the Russia-based business and management consulting companies **Vympel-Assistance LLC** and **Solar-Invest LLC**. OFAC designated Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended, for being owned or controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Benderskiy, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and E.O. 13694, as amended. **Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets** (Viktor) is Maksim’s father and a member of Evil Corp. In 2020, Viktor likely procured technical equipment in furtherance of Evil Corp’s operations. OFAC designated Viktor pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. Maksim has been careful about exposing different group members to different areas of business, however, he placed a lot of trust in his long-term associate and second-in-command, **Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Aleksandr Ryzhenkov). Maksim started working with Aleksandr Ryzhenkov around 2013 while they were both still involved in the “Business Club” group. Their partnership endured, and they worked together on the development of a number of Evil Corp’s most prolific ransomware strains. In 2016, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who is associated with the online moniker “Guester” (a pseudonym he has used while conducting operations on behalf of Evil Corp), sought to acquire internet bots in an Evil Corp operation targeting Switzerland-based targets. Since at least mid-2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov served as an interlocutor for Maksim with most of the Evil Corp members and oversaw operations of the cybercriminal group. In mid- 2017, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov targeted a New York-based bank. Following the December 2019 sanctions and indictment, Maksim and Aleksandr Ryzhenkov returned to operations targeting U.S.-based victims. In 2020, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov worked with Maksim to develop “Dridex 2.0.” **Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov** (Sergey Ryzhenkov), **Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin** (Shchetinin), **Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov** (Ramazanov), and **Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin** (Pogodin) are members of Evil Corp who have provided general support to the cybercriminal group’s activities and operations. In 2019, Sergey Ryzhenkov, the brother of Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, helped to move Evil Corp operations to a new office. In 2020, after Evil Corp’s sanctions designation and indictment, Sergey Ryzhenkov helped Aleksandr Ryzhenkov and Maksim develop “Dridex 2.0” malware. In 2017 through at least 2018, Shchetinin worked with several other Evil Corp members, including Denis Igorevich Gusev, Dmitriy Konstantinovich Smirnov, and Aleksei Bashlikov, to purchase and exchange millions of dollars’ worth of virtual and fiat currencies. In early 2020, Pogodin played a crucial role in an Evil Corp ransomware attack, and in mid-2020, he contributed to an Evil Corp ransomware attack on a U.S. company. OFAC designated Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Sergey Ryzhenkov, Shchetinin, Ramazanov, and Pogodin pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support, or goods or services in support of, Evil Corp, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended. In addition to today’s sanctions designations, the U.S. Department of Justice has [unsealed an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-indicted-series-ransomware-attacks) charging Aleksandr Ryzhenkov with using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to target numerous victims throughout the United States. Aleksandr Ryzhenkov used a variety of methods to intrude into computers systems and used his ill-gotten access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s published a [wanted poster](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/aleksandr-ryzhenkov) for Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for his alleged involvement in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Also today, the United Kingdom designated 15 and Australia designated three Evil Corp members and affiliates. ### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. F or information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897). [For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list). See OFAC’s updated [Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risk for Facilitating Ransomware Payments](/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf) for information on the actions that OFAC would consider to be mitigating factors in any related enforcement action involving ransomware payments with a potential sanctions risk.

September 1, 2022 Houston, TX, United States Counter Proliferation Investigation Unit, National Security US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners ================================================================================================================================== [![Image 13: US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners](https://www.ice.gov/assets/news/2022/220901USAO.png)](https://www.ice.gov/assets/news/2022/220901USAO.png \"US obtains warrant to seize $45M aircraft owned by Russian energy company following investigation by HSI Houston, federal partners\") HOUSTON - The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a warrant Aug. 31 for the U.S. to seize a $45 million aircraft owned by a Russian multinational oil and gas corporation following an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston, FBI Houston, and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security into alleged violations of sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. In authorizing the seizure of the Boeing 737-7EM owned by PJSC LUKOIL, the court found probable cause that the aircraft was subject to seizure based on violations of federal law. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce issued sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions impose export controls and license requirements to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The Russia sanctions expanded prohibitions on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of U.S.-manufactured aircraft to, or within, Russia without a valid license or license exception, among other things. According to court documents, LUKOIL owns the Boeing aircraft – bearing tail number VP-CLR and manufacturer serial number 34865 – which flew into and out of Russia in violation of the Department of Commerce’s Russia sanctions. “By aggressively pursuing the seizure of these assets, we have sent a resounding message to sanctions violators and third-party facilitators around the globe that we are committed to targeting any individual or entity that seeks to blatantly skirt the sanctions, export controls and license requirements imposed by the United States in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine,” said Mark Dawson, special agent in charge of HSI Houston. “Using our broad investigative and enforcement authorities and global reach, HSI will continue to work alongside our federal partners to protect U.S. national security interests and inflict maximum disruptive effects against anyone who violates these sanctions in an effort to support the Russian government.” “The FBI will remain focused and faithful to our responsibility to protect our U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Special Agent in Charge James Smith of the FBI – Houston Field Office. “We’ll continue to go after individuals who insist on helping Russia advance its hostile and illegal activities, and we’ll continue to seize their valuable possessions, wherever they may be. We thank Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Commerce for their partnership in this case.” “Once again, the United States, through its experts at the FBI and the Department of Commerce, has laid open a series of shell companies and sham corporations designed to conceal the ownership and illegal movements of controlled technology,” said Task Force KleptoCapture Director Andrew C. Adams. “The aircraft at the center of today’s affidavit was ultimately the property of Lukoil, though that ownership was obscured through a now-public series of holding companies. With today’s unsealed affidavit, aviation, insurance, and financial services companies are made aware of that nesting doll-structure and can proactively avoid the provision of services that might aid the movement of this tainted aircraft as the United States pursues its seizure.” “Today’s actions to enforce the powerful export restrictions placed on Russia are our latest coordinated measures that let Vladimir Putin and his allies know they are isolated, and we are watching,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement continues to vigorously enforce the export laws of the United States and stand with the people of Ukraine against Putin’s war of aggression.” The Boeing last flew into the United States in March 2019 when the plane flew from overseas to Houston with LUKOIL officials, including a Russian oligarch – then LUKOIL president and CEO Vagit Alekperov – on board the aircraft. The Boeing is believed to be in Russia and worth approximately $45 million. Since September 2014, LUKOIL, which is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and has ties to Houston, Texas, has been subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The seizure action is being coordinated through the Justice Department’s [Task Force KleptoCapture](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-announces-launch-task-force-kleptocapture), an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia’s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all the department’s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression. The investigation into the additional aircraft remains ongoing. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Brandon L. Fyffe of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Lindsay M. Heck and Sinan Kalayoglu of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section are leading the seizure action. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI’s New York Field Office and the Federal Aviation Administration provided significant assistance.

În cadrul lui, pe 7 august, ei au făcut 78 de percheziții și au reținut două persoane, care sunt judecate pentru acțiuni similare, la Soroca. Pe 8 august, Inspectoratul General al Poliției (IGP) a anunțat că deține probe care confirmă că un grup de persoane se pregătea să corupă votanți la alegerile parlamentare din 28 septembrie. Oamenii legii spun că persoanele vizate în investigații acționau în beneficiul organizației criminale a oligarhului fugar Ilan Șor. Poliția a publicat și interceptări audio, în care se aude că oamenii care vor lucra cu alegătorii în interesul „echipei lui Ilan Șor” vor primi „bonusuri pentru incomodități”. Persoana care vorbește instruiește o alta că, la fiecare acuzație că Ilan Șor este un infractor, să răspundă că el, de fapt, are grijă de oameni și le oferă pensionarilor cte 2.000 de lei. ## **Bani din Rusia și indicații pe Telegram** Poliția susține că oamenii la care au avut loc perchezițiile transferau și distribuiau bani de proveniență dubioasă, obținuți prin intermediul aplicației mobile PSB a băncii rusești Promsviazbank. În cadrul investigațiilor, s-a stabilit că reprezentanții organizației criminale instalează în telefoanele cetățenilor aplicația „Taito”, care funcționează similar aplicației PSB, utilizate pentru cumpărarea voturilor la alegerile prezidențiale din 2024. De asemenea, prin Taito și Telegram, persoanele vizate primeau indicații de la „curatorii din Federația Rusă”, inclusiv sarcini de a distribui și a comenta link-uri cu videoclipuri de dezinformare pe rețelele de socializare. În capturile de ecran publicate de IGP, se vede cum simpatizanții blocului politic „Victorie”, condus de Ilan Șor, au fost invitați la un curs despre cum ar trebui să se comporte activiștii dacă se întlnesc cu Poliția. În urma perchezițiilor, oamenii legii au ridicat mai multe arme deținute ilegal, telefoane mobile, laptopuri, documente bancare, carduri Pyypl și înscrisuri „care demonstrează activitatea infracțională a grupării”. Poliția spune că investigațiile vor continua pentru a atrage la răspundere penală toate persoanele implicate. 📰 **Europa Liberă Moldova este și pe Google News.** [**Abonează-te**](http://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEBK2nJhSrsXQ-VLldxYIX7UqFAgKIhAStpyYUq7F0PlS5XcWCF-1) * #### [Nadejda Coptu](/author/nadejda-coptu/rtikqo) La Europa Liberă Moldova scriu despre justiție.

Peste 40 de percheziții au avut loc simultan la domiciliile suspecților și la sediile unor firme din Chișinău. Persoanele vizate sunt bănuite că ar fi implicate într-o rețea de contrabandă cu tutun, spălare de bani și migrație ilegală.** Potrivit unui comunicat al PCCOCS, rețeaua a fost monitorizată timp de aproximativ un an, perioadă în care au fost adunate probe privind o activitate infracțională desfășurată la scară largă. Investigațiile au scos la iveală un mecanism bine pus la punct, în care fiecare membru avea un rol clar în lanțul de producție, transport și distribuție a țigaretelor contrafăcute. Printre cei implicați se numără administratori ai unor companii comerciale care erau folosite drept paravan pentru acțiuni ilegale, în special transportul de tutun și țigări în Uniunea Europeană. Un cetățean moldovean avea un rol-cheie în rețea: se ocupa de recrutarea forței de muncă, în special lucrători din rândul cetățenilor cazaci, greci, bulgari și ucraineni, care erau transportați în fabrici clandestine din Europa. Banii obținuți din activitățile ilegale erau trecuți printr-o schemă complexă: erau reinvestiți în bunuri mobile și imobile, dar și în afaceri cu aparență de legalitate din Republica Moldova. Suma totală introdusă în economia națională este considerată de proporții deosebit de mari, arată anchetatorii. În urma perchezițiilor, au fost ridicate automobile de lux, peste 25.000 de euro, mii de dolari, pachete de țigări suspecte a fi contrafăcute (cu aceleași coduri unice ca cele găsite anterior în Italia), tehnică de calcul, telefoane, carduri bancare, planuri scrise manual, dar și ștampile ale unor companii și instituții. De asemenea, au fost depistate și arme de foc deținute ilegal, păstrate în condiții contrare legii. Video Player is loading.

Anchetatorii au reușit să identifice întregul cerc de persoane implicate în gruparea criminală. Fiecare membru avea sarcini precise, iar activitatea era desfășurată ierarhic, într-o structură bine organizată. Organizatorul rețelei, un bărbat de 39 de ani, a fost reținut pentru 72 de ore. Acesta ar fi coordonat recrutarea muncitorilor din Moldova și Ucraina, achiziția și transportul utilajelor, precum și toate activitățile logistice și administrative ale rețelei. Cercetările sunt în desfășurare pentru a stabili întreaga arie de implicare și tragerea la răspundere a tuturor persoanelor implicate. Suspecții beneficiază, până la o eventuală condamnare definitivă, de toate drepturile procesuale, inclusiv de prezumția de nevinovăție. Totodată, în cadrul investigațiilor au apărut și indicii privind implicarea rețelei în migrație ilegală, aspect care urmează să fie cercetat separat. De asemenea, urmează să fie deschis un dosar penal și pentru păstrarea și comercializarea ilegală a armelor și munițiilor. ![Image 33](https://tv8.md/resources/2023/09/22/76349299-fc63-4adb-9c88-371c26e379ef_LogoTV8.png) [Redacția TV8](https://tv8.md/author/redac%C8%9Bia-tv-8) ![Image 34](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/mailLight.svg) ![Image 35](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/messengerOriginal.svg)![Image 36: Facebook](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/facebookOriginal.svg)![Image 37](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/twitterOriginal_2.svg)![Image 38: Telegram](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/telegramOriginal.svg)![Image 39](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/viber.svg) Cutia Neagră PLUS Știri cu Angela Gonța Cutia Neagră Întreabă Ghețu Новая неделя Verde-n ochi Alo, TV8 Iubește viața Psihologul meu Campionii Vania Băț News Show Итоги Недели c Ириной Стряпко Новости с Яной Степаненко Business UP Dosarele X Новости с Ириной Стряпко Sinteza săptămânii Secretul banilor Foc la Ghete! ###### Cutia Neagră PLUS: Patronii lui Usatîi Partidul Nostru al lui Renato Usatii a fost lider la Parlamentare la donații primite de la pensionari și șomeri.

Potrivit unui comunicat al poliției, primul suspect, un bărbat de 34 de ani din Chișinău, a fost reținut în timp ce conducea autoturismul în care transporta aproximativ 2,5 kilograme de marijuana și hașiș, drogurile fiind împărțite în 140 de pliculețe care ar fi fost pregătite pentru vânzare în Bălți. Ulterior, poliția l-a reținut și pe al doilea bănuit, un tânăr de 25 de ani din Chișinău, de la care, potrivit anchetatorilor, primul suspect ar fi obținut drogurile. Cei doi suspecți ar face parte dintr-un grup infracțional care comercializa droguri atât în municipiu, cât și în Telenești și în raioanele învecinate, prin comenzi primite de la clienți pe aplicația Telegram. De asemenea, grupul ar fi fost în curs de extindere și căuta alți complici - „dealeri” - pentru a-și spori activitatea de vânzare a drogurilor. În urma opririi autoturismului și confiscării drogurilor, șoferul suspect a fost supus examinării medicale, care a confirmat că se afla la volan sub influența marijuanei și a cocainei. La cererea procurorilor, primul suspect a fost plasat în arest preventiv, iar mașina sa a fost ridicată pentru trafic de droguri și va fi confiscată. Al doilea reținut este acuzat de complicitate la trafic de droguri, iar ancheta continuă pentru identificarea altor membri ai grupului. ![Image 85](https://tv8.md/resources/2023/09/22/76349299-fc63-4adb-9c88-371c26e379ef_LogoTV8.png) [Redacția TV8](https://tv8.md/author/redac%C8%9Bia-tv-8) ![Image 86](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/mailLight.svg) ![Image 87](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/messengerOriginal.svg)![Image 88: Facebook](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/facebookOriginal.svg)![Image 89](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/twitterOriginal_2.svg)![Image 90: Telegram](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/telegramOriginal.svg)![Image 91](https://tv8.md/_next/static/filles/viber.svg) Cutia Neagră PLUS Știri cu Angela Gonța Cutia Neagră Întreabă Ghețu Новая неделя Verde-n ochi Alo, TV8 Iubește viața Psihologul meu Campionii Vania Băț News Show Итоги Недели c Ириной Стряпко Новости с Яной Степаненко Business UP Dosarele X Новости с Ириной Стряпко Sinteza săptămânii Secretul banilor Foc la Ghete! ###### O adolescentă de 13 ani din capitală a fost găsită moartă în incinta clădirii abandonate a fostului Hotel Național.

While based primarily in Russia, Lukoil’s extensive cross-border dealings and correspondent banking relationships have raised concerns among compliance authorities in multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\nAnti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) frameworks play a critical role in assessing Lukoil’s transactional behavior, particularly given the complexity of beneficial ownership structures and the involvement of politically exposed persons (PEPs) within its corporate network. Transaction monitoring systems are reportedly challenged by the volume and opacity of transfers, with suspicious activity reports (SARs) flagged for patterns consistent with layering and integration phases of money laundering. The presence of high-risk counterparties and jurisdictions subject to sanctions further complicates the risk profile, necessitating enhanced due diligence and ongoing surveillance.\\n\\nRegulatory enforcement agencies have reportedly initiated probes into Lukoil’s compliance with international AML standards, focusing on alleged breaches related to inadequate KYC protocols and failure to detect illicit fund flows. Unresolved consent orders and pending investigations suggest a pattern of regulatory pushback, with potential settlements or fines in the vague range of several million dollars under discussion. Enforcement risk is amplified by Lukoil’s exposure to sanctions regimes, which may increase correspondent banking partners’ reluctance and elevate operational risks.\\n\\nIn sum, Lukoil remains at the center of regulatory attention due to alleged money laundering vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of robust AML controls and transparent governance in mitigating enforcement risks and preserving correspondent banking relationships.',\n",

The company’s cash-intensive operations and complex international transactions have drawn attention from financial investigators focusing on the detection of irregularities that may indicate money laundering activities. The oil sector’s inherent exposure to high-value, cross-border payments provides fertile ground for layering and integration strategies designed to obscure illicit origins.\\n\\nAML and KYC protocols are critical in identifying suspicious counterparties and transactional behavior associated with Lukoil. Enhanced due diligence measures, including thorough beneficial ownership verification and politically exposed person (PEP) screening, are essential to mitigate risks. Transaction monitoring systems flagged a series of unusual payment structures involving correspondent banking relationships and shell entities, which often serve as red flags in suspicious activity reports (SARs). The presence of cash-intensive flows coupled with inconsistent documentation further complicates compliance efforts and heightens the need for robust internal controls.\\n\\nRegulatory bodies have hypothetically launched probes into Lukoil’s financial practices, focusing on potential breaches of anti-money laundering statutes and sanctions compliance. Investigations reportedly examine whether Lukoil’s consent orders or settlements, if any, adequately address the layering and integration phases of money laundering. Financial institutions connected to Lukoil may face increased scrutiny, particularly regarding their KYC frameworks and transaction monitoring effectiveness in detecting illicit flows. The evolving enforcement landscape underscores the importance of transparent reporting and cooperation with authorities.\\n\\nLukoil remains at the center of concerns over suspicious financial patterns indicative of money laundering risks, highlighting the ongoing challenges in monitoring complex, cash-sensitive operations within the oil industry.',\n",

The focus centers on Lukoil’s ability to identify and verify ultimate beneficial owners, particularly where ownership structures exhibit opacity. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of Lukoil’s know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and transaction monitoring systems, especially in detecting politically exposed persons (PEPs) and sanctioned entities. Such screening failures represent critical risk indicators that could expose correspondent banking relationships to heightened money laundering vulnerabilities.\\n\\nFrom an AML compliance perspective, Lukoil’s challenges appear rooted in insufficient beneficial ownership disclosures, limited transparency in complex ownership chains, and potential lapses in sanctions screening protocols. Effective KYC frameworks typically require comprehensive verification of beneficial owners alongside ongoing transaction monitoring and timely filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs). The presence of opaque ownership structures and failure to flag high-risk PEPs or sanctioned parties can undermine these safeguards, increasing regulatory and reputational risks for Lukoil and its banking partners.\\n\\nRegulatory authorities have hypothetically initiated a consent order and launched a settlement discussion with Lukoil, reflecting concerns over compliance shortfalls. The probe reportedly explores allegations of inadequate AML controls, including potential lapses in correspondent banking oversight and insufficient reporting of suspicious transactions. While no formal fines or penalties have been disclosed, the enforcement posture underscores the importance of robust KYC and beneficial ownership transparency in mitigating money laundering risks within high-risk sectors like energy.\\n\\nIn summary, Lukoil’s case illustrates how ownership opacity and screening deficiencies remain critical risk factors in AML compliance. Strengthening beneficial ownership disclosures and enhancing PEP and sanctions screening are essential steps for Lukoil to address potential vulnerabilities in its anti-money laundering framework.'],\n",

The investigation found probable cause that LUKOIL violated U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, specifically export controls and license requirements related to U.S.-manufactured aircraft. The aircraft, owned by LUKOIL and identified by tail number VP-CLR and serial number 34865, was found to have flown into and out of Russia in violation of these sanctions. The ownership of the aircraft was obscured through a series of shell companies. LUKOIL has been subject to sectoral sanctions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control since September 2014. The seizure action is coordinated through the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, which enforces sanctions and export controls against Russia. The investigation into additional aircraft remains ongoing.',\n",

      "**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n",
      "\n",
      "Lukoil is currently subject to U.S. sanctions, with a notable enforcement action involving the seizure of a $45 million aircraft by U.S. authorities in 2022. There is no evidence of fines paid to date, but the scale of the asset seizure and ongoing sanction status indicate unresolved and significant compliance risk. The most serious issue is the violation of U.S. sanctions and export controls, directly tied to Russia, with potential regional impacts extending to Romania and Moldova. The risk is ongoing, as evidenced by recent references to sanctions as of 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VIOLATION ANALYSIS**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **What They Did Wrong:**  \n",
      "  Lukoil violated U.S. sanctions and export controls related to Russia, resulting in a federal warrant for the seizure of a $45 million aircraft (Boeing 737-7EM) on August 31, 2022.  \n",
      "- **When:**  \n",
      "  The aircraft seizure occurred in September 2022.  \n",
      "  Lukoil remains subject to U.S. sanctions as of November 2025, with regional implications for fuel supply in Romania and Moldova.\n",

      "  The asset seizure is a resolved enforcement action, but the underlying sanctions and export control violations are ongoing.  \n",
      "- **Active Investigations:**  \n",
      "  Lukoil remains under U.S. sanctions, with no evidence of settlement or resolution.  \n",
      "- **Investigating Authorities:**  \n",
      "  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas; U.S. government (sanctions enforcement).  \n",
